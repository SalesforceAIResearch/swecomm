#### autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr  
#### When using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap  
#### from sympy import MatrixSymbol  
#### import numpy as np  
####   
#### x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)  
#### expr = 1.0  
#### f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')  
####   
#### f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))  
#### ```  
####   
#### This should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:  
#### ```python  
#### TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars  
#### ```  
####   
#### A little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrect signature:  
####   
#### ```C  
#### double autofunc(double x) {  
####   
####    double autofunc_result;  
####    autofunc_result = 1.0;  
####    return autofunc_result;  
####   
#### }  
#### ```  
####   
#### (`x` should be `double *`, not `double` in this case)  
####   
#### I've found that this error won't occur so long as `expr` depends at least in part on each argument. For example this slight modification of the above counterexample works perfectly:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap  
#### from sympy import MatrixSymbol  
#### import numpy as np  
####   
#### x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)  
#### # now output depends on x  
#### expr = x[0,0]  
#### f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')  
####   
#### # returns 1.0 as expected, without failure  
#### f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))  
#### ```  
####   
#### This may seem like a silly issue ("why even have `x` as an argument if it doesn't appear in the expression you're trying to evaluate?"). But of course in interfacing with external libraries (e.g. for numerical integration), one often needs functions to have a pre-defined signature regardless of whether a given argument contributes to the output.  
####   
#### I think I've identified the problem in `codegen` and will suggest a PR shortly.

To address the issue with the `autowrap` function using the `cython` backend, we will likely need to modify the code generation logic to ensure that array arguments are correctly handled even if they do not appear in the final expression.

The files most likely to need changes are:
1. `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py`
2. `sympy/codegen/cython.py`

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To address the issue, we need to ensure that the code generation logic in `autowrap` correctly handles array arguments even if they do not appear in the final expression. This will involve modifying the `_partition_args` method in the `CythonCodeWrapper` class to ensure that array arguments are correctly identified and handled.

Here is the necessary change:

sympy/utilities/autowrap.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Find arguments that are array dimensions. These can be inferred
        # locally in the Cython code.
        if isinstance(arg, (InputArgument, InOutArgument)) and arg.dimensions:
            dims = [d[1] + 1 for d in arg.dimensions]
            sym_dims = [(i, d) for (i, d) in enumerate(dims) if
                        isinstance(d, Symbol)]
            for (i, d) in sym_dims:
                py_inferred[d] = (arg.name, i)
        for arg in args:
            if arg.name in py_inferred:
                py_inferred[arg] = py_inferred.pop(arg.name)
        # Filter inferred arguments from py_args
        py_args = [a for a in py_args if a not in py_inferred]
        return py_returns, py_args, py_locals, py_inferred
=======
        # Ensure all arguments are included, even if they do not appear in the expression
        for arg in args:
            if isinstance(arg, (InputArgument, InOutArgument)) and arg.dimensions:
                dims = [d[1] + 1 for d in arg.dimensions]
                sym_dims = [(i, d) for (i, d) in enumerate(dims) if
                            isinstance(d, Symbol)]
                for (i, d) in sym_dims:
                    py_inferred[d] = (arg.name, i)
            if arg.name in py_inferred:
                py_inferred[arg] = py_inferred.pop(arg.name)
        return py_returns, py_args, py_locals, py_inferred
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that all arguments, including those that do not appear in the final expression, are correctly handled by the code generation logic.
