#### convert_to seems to combine orthogonal units  
#### Tested in sympy 1.4, not presently in a position to install 1.5+.  
#### Simple example. Consider `J = kg*m**2/s**2 => J*s = kg*m**2/s`. The convert_to behavior is odd:  
#### ```  
#### >>>convert_to(joule*second,joule)  
####     joule**(7/9)  
#### ```  
#### I would expect the unchanged original expression back, an expression in terms of base units, or an error. It appears that convert_to can only readily handle conversions where the full unit expression is valid.  
####   
#### Note that the following three related examples give sensible results:  
#### ```  
#### >>>convert_to(joule*second,joule*second)  
####     joule*second  
#### ```  
#### ```  
#### >>>convert_to(J*s, kg*m**2/s)  
####     kg*m**2/s  
#### ```  
#### ```  
#### >>>convert_to(J*s,mins)  
####     J*mins/60  
#### ```

To address the issue with `convert_to` combining orthogonal units, the most likely file that will need changes is:

- `sympy/physics/units/util.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To address the issue with `convert_to` combining orthogonal units, we need to modify the `convert_to` function in `sympy/physics/units/util.py`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the function can handle cases where the full unit expression is not valid for conversion.

Here are the changes:

1. Add a check to ensure that the target units are compatible with the expression's dimensions.
2. If the units are not compatible, return the original expression or raise an error.

Let's implement these changes:

sympy/physics/units/util.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if depmat is None:
        return expr
=======
    if depmat is None or any(p != int(p) for p in depmat):
        # If the dimensions are not compatible, return the original expression
        return expr
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if the dimensions are not compatible, the function will return the original expression instead of attempting an invalid conversion.
