#### Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Django allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.  
#### I have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.

To implement this change, the most likely files that will need to be edited are:

1. `django/contrib/admin/options.py` - This file contains the `InlineModelAdmin` class where the verbose_name and verbose_name_plural are defined and managed.

Please add `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To implement the change where `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline class should by default be based on the `verbose_name` for an Inline if that is specified, we need to modify the `InlineModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.

Here are the steps:
1. Update the `__init__` method of `InlineModelAdmin` to set `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if `verbose_name_plural` is not explicitly provided.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/contrib/admin/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
=======
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.verbose_name + 's' if self.verbose_name else self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if `verbose_name` is specified and `verbose_name_plural` is not, `verbose_name_plural` will be derived from `verbose_name`. If neither is specified, it will fall back to the model's `verbose_name_plural`.
