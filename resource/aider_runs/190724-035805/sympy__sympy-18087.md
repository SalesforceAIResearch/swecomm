#### Simplify of simple trig expression fails  
#### trigsimp in various versions, including 1.5, incorrectly simplifies cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2) as though it were cos(x)+sin(x) for general complex x. (Oddly it gets this right if x is real.)  
####   
#### Embarrassingly I found this by accident while writing sympy-based teaching material...

To address the issue with `trigsimp` incorrectly simplifying `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)`, we will likely need to make changes to the trigonometric simplification logic in the `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` file.

Please add the `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `trigsimp` incorrectly simplifying `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)`, we need to ensure that the simplification logic correctly handles the square root of squared trigonometric functions. Specifically, we need to ensure that `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is simplified to `Abs(sin(x))` rather than `sin(x)` for general complex `x`.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Import the `Abs` function from `sympy`.
2. Modify the `_trigsimp` function to handle the square root of squared trigonometric functions correctly.

Let's proceed with the changes:

sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from sympy.functions import sin, cos, exp, cosh, tanh, sinh, tan, cot, coth
=======
from sympy.functions import sin, cos, exp, cosh, tanh, sinh, tan, cot, coth, Abs
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if expr.is_Mul or expr.is_Pow or deep and expr.args:
=======
    if expr.is_Pow and expr.exp == S.Half and expr.base.is_Pow and expr.base.exp == 2:
        base = expr.base.base
        if base.func in (sin, cos, tan, cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, coth):
            expr = Abs(base)
    elif expr.is_Mul or expr.is_Pow or deep and expr.args:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is simplified to `Abs(sin(x))`, which is the correct simplification for general complex `x`.

Let's correct the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to ensure it matches the existing code exactly.

sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    elif expr.is_Mul or expr.is_Pow or deep and expr.args:
=======
    elif expr.is_Pow and expr.exp == S.Half and expr.base.is_Pow and expr.base.exp == 2:
        base = expr.base.base
        if base.func in (sin, cos, tan, cot, sinh, cosh, tanh, coth):
            expr = Abs(base)
    elif expr.is_Mul or expr.is_Pow or deep and expr.args:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
