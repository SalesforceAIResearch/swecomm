#### QuerySet.none() on combined queries returns all results.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I came across this issue on Stack Overflow. I'm not 100% sure it's a bug, but it does seem strange. With this code (excuse the bizarre example filtering):  
#### class Publication(models.Model):  
#### 	pass  
#### class Article(models.Model):  
#### 	publications = models.ManyToManyField(to=Publication, blank=True, null=True)  
#### class ArticleForm(forms.ModelForm):  
#### 	publications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(  
#### 		Publication.objects.filter(id__lt=2) | Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5),  
#### 		required=False,  
#### 	)  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		model = Article  
#### 		fields = ["publications"]  
#### class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):  
#### 	form = ArticleForm  
#### This works well. However, changing the ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset to use union() breaks things.  
#### publications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(  
#### 	Publication.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(  
#### 		Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5)  
#### 	),  
#### 	required=False,  
#### )  
#### The form correctly shows only the matching objects. However, if you submit this form while empty (i.e. you didn't select any publications), ALL objects matching the queryset will be added. Using the OR query, NO objects are added, as I'd expect.

To address the issue with `QuerySet.none()` on combined queries, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `django/db/models/query.py`
2. `django/forms/models.py`

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `QuerySet.none()` on combined queries, we need to ensure that the `none()` method correctly handles combined queries. We will make changes to the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py`.

Here are the steps:

1. Modify the `none()` method in the `QuerySet` class to handle combined queries correctly.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        clone.query.set_empty()
=======
        if self.query.combinator:
            clone.query = self.model._base_manager.none().query
        else:
            clone.query.set_empty()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when `none()` is called on a combined query, it correctly returns an empty result set.

No changes are needed in `django/forms/models.py` for this specific issue. If you have any other requests or need further modifications, please let me know!
