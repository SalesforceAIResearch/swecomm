#### HttpResponse doesn't handle memoryview objects  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I am trying to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:  
#### from django.http import HttpResponse																	   
#### # String content  
#### response = HttpResponse("My Content")																			  
#### response.content																								   
#### # Out: b'My Content'  
#### # This is correct  
#### # Bytes content  
#### response = HttpResponse(b"My Content")																		   
#### response.content																								   
#### # Out: b'My Content'  
#### # This is also correct  
#### # memoryview content  
#### response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))															   
#### response.content  
#### # Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'  
#### # This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'

To handle `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`, we will likely need to modify the `django/http/response.py` file. This file contains the `HttpResponse` class and its handling of content.

Please add `django/http/response.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To handle `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`, we need to modify the `make_bytes` method in the `HttpResponseBase` class to properly convert `memoryview` objects to bytes.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/http/response.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Handle non-string types.
=======
        # Handle memoryview types.
        if isinstance(value, memoryview):
            return value.tobytes()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/http/response.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Handle non-string types.
        return str(value).encode(self.charset)
=======
        # Handle non-string types.
        return str(value).encode(self.charset)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/http/response.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Handle string types -- we can't rely on force_bytes here because:
        # - Python attempts str conversion first
        # - when self._charset != 'utf-8' it re-encodes the content
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            return bytes(value)
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return bytes(value.encode(self.charset))
=======
        # Handle string types -- we can't rely on force_bytes here because:
        # - Python attempts str conversion first
        # - when self._charset != 'utf-8' it re-encodes the content
        if isinstance(value, bytes):
            return bytes(value)
        if isinstance(value, str):
            return bytes(value.encode(self.charset))
        # Handle memoryview types.
        if isinstance(value, memoryview):
            return value.tobytes()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
