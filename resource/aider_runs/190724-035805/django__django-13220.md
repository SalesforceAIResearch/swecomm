#### Allow ValidationErrors to equal each other when created identically  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by kamni)  
#### 	   
#### Currently ValidationErrors (django.core.exceptions.ValidationError) that have identical messages don't equal each other, which is counter-intuitive, and can make certain kinds of testing more complicated. Please add an __eq__ method that allows two ValidationErrors to be compared.   
#### Ideally, this would be more than just a simple self.messages == other.messages. It would be most helpful if the comparison were independent of the order in which errors were raised in a field or in non_field_errors.

To implement the requested feature, we will need to modify the `django/core/exceptions.py` file to add an `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class.

Please add the `django/core/exceptions.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Here is the change to add an `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class to allow for comparison of `ValidationError` instances:

django/core/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __repr__(self):
=======
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, ValidationError):
            return False
        return sorted(self.messages) == sorted(other.messages)

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/core/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return 'ValidationError(%s)' % self
=======
        return 'ValidationError(%s)' % self
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/core/exceptions.py
