#### Improve handling of skip for module level  
#### This is potentially about updating docs, updating error messages or introducing a new API.  
####   
#### Consider the following scenario:  
####   
#### `pos_only.py` is using Python 3,8 syntax:  
#### ```python  
#### def foo(a, /, b):  
####     return a + b  
#### ```  
####   
#### It should not be tested under Python 3.6 and 3.7.  
#### This is a proper way to skip the test in Python older than 3.8:  
#### ```python  
#### from pytest import raises, skip  
#### import sys  
#### if sys.version_info < (3, 8):  
####     skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)  
####   
#### # import must be after the module level skip:  
#### from pos_only import *  
####   
#### def test_foo():  
####     assert foo(10, 20) == 30  
####     assert foo(10, b=20) == 30  
####     with raises(TypeError):  
####         assert foo(a=10, b=20)  
#### ```  
####   
#### My actual test involves parameterize and a 3.8 only class, so skipping the test itself is not sufficient because the 3.8 class was used in the parameterization.  
####   
#### A naive user will try to initially skip the module like:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### if sys.version_info < (3, 8):  
####     skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8")  
#### ```  
#### This issues this error:  
####   
#### >Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.  
####   
#### The proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).  
####   
#### The correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.  
####   
#### This area feels a bit unpolished.  
#### A few ideas to improve:  
####   
#### 1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.  
#### 2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module("reason")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.  
####

To improve the handling of module-level skips, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` - To introduce a new API `skip_module`.
2. `src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py` - To update the error message to explain `skip` with `allow_module_level`.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the changes needed to improve the handling of module-level skips:

1. Introduce a new API `skip_module` in `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`.
2. Update the error message in `src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py` to explain `skip` with `allow_module_level`.

Let's start with the changes:

### 1. Introduce `skip_module` in `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`

src/_pytest/outcomes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def skip(msg: str = "", *, allow_module_level: bool = False) -> "NoReturn":
=======
@_with_exception(Skipped)
def skip_module(msg: str = "") -> "NoReturn":
    """Skip the entire module with the given message.

    This function should be called at the module level to skip the entire module.

    :param str msg: The message to show the user as reason for the skip.
    """
    __tracebackhide__ = True
    raise Skipped(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)


@_with_exception(Skipped)
def skip(msg: str = "", *, allow_module_level: bool = False) -> "NoReturn":
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 2. Update the error message in `src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py`

src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8")
=======
    skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will introduce a new `skip_module` function to make it easier to skip an entire module and update the error message to explain the correct usage of `skip` with `allow_module_level`.

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py`:

src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
>Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}.
=======
>Using pytest.skip outside of a test is not allowed. To decorate a test function, use the @pytest.mark.skip or @pytest.mark.skipif decorators instead, and to skip a module use `pytest.skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)`.

```

Let's correct the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py` by including more context to ensure an exact match:

src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
The proposed solution `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, does not work  in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).
=======
The proposed solution `pytest.skip(msg="Requires Python >= 3.8", allow_module_level=True)`, does not work in my case: pytest continues to process the file and fail when it hits the 3.8 syntax (when running with an older version of Python).
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's include more context to ensure an exact match for the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block in `src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py`:

src/_pytest/mark/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
The correct solution, to use skip as a function is actively discouraged by the error message.

This area feels a bit unpolished.
A few ideas to improve:

1. Explain skip with  `allow_module_level` in the error message. this seems in conflict with the spirit of the message.
2. Create an alternative API to skip a module to make things easier: `skip_module("reason")`, which can call `_skip(msg=msg, allow_module_level=True)`.
