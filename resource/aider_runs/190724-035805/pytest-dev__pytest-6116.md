To add a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we will likely need to modify the following file:

1. `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` - This file is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and is where we would add the new shortcut.

Please add `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we will:

1. Locate the section where the `--collect-only` option is defined.
2. Add a new short option, for example, `-c`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to implement this change:

src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._anonymous.addoption(
            "--collect-only",
            action="store_true",
            help="only collect tests, don't execute them",
        )
=======
        self._anonymous.addoption(
            "-c", "--collect-only",
            action="store_true",
            help="only collect tests, don't execute them",
        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's try again with a more extensive search block to ensure we match the correct section.
