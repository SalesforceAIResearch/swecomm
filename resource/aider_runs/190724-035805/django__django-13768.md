#### Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### As pointed out by â€‹Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.

To log exceptions handled in `Signal.send_robust()`, we will need to edit the `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py` file. Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To log exceptions in `Signal.send_robust()`, we need to:

1. Import the `logging` module.
2. Add a `logger` instance.
3. Log exceptions in the `except` block of the `send_robust` method.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import threading
import warnings
import weakref

from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning
from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs
=======
import logging
import threading
import warnings
import weakref

from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning
from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            except Exception as err:
=======
            except Exception as err:
                logger.exception('Error in signal handler for %s', receiver)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that any exceptions raised in the signal handlers are logged, making it easier to debug issues.
