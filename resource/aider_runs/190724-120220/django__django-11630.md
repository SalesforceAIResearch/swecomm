#### Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Error message:  
#### table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.  
#### We have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.  
#### We have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.   
#### Is this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.

To address the issue of Django throwing an error when different apps with different models have the same table name, we will likely need to modify the model definitions to ensure that they have unique `db_table` names. This can be done by setting the `db_table` attribute in the `Meta` class of each model.

The files that are most likely to need changes are the model definition files in your apps. These files typically reside in the `models.py` file of each app.

Please add the following files to the chat:
1. `base/models.py`
2. `app2/models.py`

Once you add these files, I can provide the necessary changes to resolve the issue.
