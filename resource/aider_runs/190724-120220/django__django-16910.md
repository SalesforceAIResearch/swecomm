#### QuerySet.only() doesn't work with select_related() on a reverse OneToOneField relation.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### On Django 4.2 calling only() with select_related() on a query using the reverse lookup for a OneToOne relation does not generate the correct query.  
#### All the fields from the related model are still included in the generated SQL.  
#### Sample models:  
#### class Main(models.Model):  
#### 	main_field_1 = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=45)  
#### 	main_field_2 = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=45)  
#### 	main_field_3 = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=45)  
#### class Secondary(models.Model):  
#### 	main = models.OneToOneField(Main, primary_key=True, related_name='secondary', on_delete=models.CASCADE)  
#### 	secondary_field_1 = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=45)  
#### 	secondary_field_2 = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=45)  
#### 	secondary_field_3 = models.CharField(blank=True, max_length=45)  
#### Sample code:  
#### Main.objects.select_related('secondary').only('main_field_1', 'secondary__secondary_field_1')  
#### Generated query on Django 4.2.1:  
#### SELECT "bugtest_main"."id", "bugtest_main"."main_field_1", "bugtest_secondary"."main_id", "bugtest_secondary"."secondary_field_1", "bugtest_secondary"."secondary_field_2", "bugtest_secondary"."secondary_field_3" FROM "bugtest_main" LEFT OUTER JOIN "bugtest_secondary" ON ("bugtest_main"."id" = "bugtest_secondary"."main_id")  
#### Generated query on Django 4.1.9:  
#### SELECT "bugtest_main"."id", "bugtest_main"."main_field_1", "bugtest_secondary"."main_id", "bugtest_secondary"."secondary_field_1" FROM "bugtest_main" LEFT OUTER JOIN "bugtest_secondary" ON ("bugtest_main"."id" = "bugtest_secondary"."main_id")

To address the issue with `QuerySet.only()` not working correctly with `select_related()` on a reverse `OneToOneField` relation, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `django/db/models/query.py` - This file contains the `QuerySet` class and its methods, including `only()` and `select_related()`.
2. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - This file handles the SQL generation for queries, which is where the issue with the generated SQL query would need to be fixed.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `QuerySet.only()` not working correctly with `select_related()` on a reverse `OneToOneField` relation, we need to make changes in the `django/db/models/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/query.py` files.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `only()` method in `QuerySet` to correctly handle the reverse `OneToOneField` relation.
2. Ensure that the SQL generation in `query.py` respects the fields specified in `only()`.

Let's start with the changes in `django/db/models/query.py`:

Let's proceed with the necessary changes to address the issue with `QuerySet.only()` not working correctly with `select_related()` on a reverse `OneToOneField` relation.

First, we'll modify the `only()` method in `QuerySet` to correctly handle the reverse `OneToOneField` relation.

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:
                raise ValueError("only() is not supported with FilteredRelation.")
        clone = self._chain()
        clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)
        return clone
=======
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:
                raise ValueError("only() is not supported with FilteredRelation.")
        clone = self._chain()
        clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)
        # Ensure related fields are also deferred correctly
        for field in fields:
            if LOOKUP_SEP in field:
                related_field, related_name = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)
                if related_field in self.query.select_related:
                    clone.query.add_immediate_loading([related_field])
        return clone
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we'll ensure that the SQL generation respects the fields specified in `only()`.

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
