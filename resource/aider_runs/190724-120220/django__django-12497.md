#### Wrong hint about recursive relationship.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)  
#### 	   
#### When there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:  
#### hint=(  
#### 	'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '  
#### 	'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'  
#### But 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.  
#### This was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.  
#### Edit: fixed description.

To address the issue with the incorrect hint about recursive relationships, we need to update the error message in the relevant file. The file most likely to need changes is:

- `django/db/models/fields/related.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

Here is the necessary change to correct the hint about recursive relationships in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file:

```python
django/db/models/fields/related.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                            hint=(
                                'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
                                'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'
                            ) % (
                                RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
                                relationship_model_name,
                            ),
=======
                            hint=(
                                'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
                                'use ManyToManyField("%s", through="%s").'
                            ) % (
                                RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
                                relationship_model_name,
                            ),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
