#### decompose() function in intpoly returns a list of arbitrary order  
#### The decompose() function, with separate=True, returns `list(poly_dict.values())`, which is ordered arbitrarily.    
####   
#### What is this used for? It should be sorted somehow, or returning a set (in which case, why not just use the returned dictionary and have the caller take the values). This is causing test failures for me after some changes to the core.

To address the issue with the `decompose()` function in `intpoly`, we need to:

1. Identify the file where the `decompose()` function is implemented.
2. Modify the function to return a sorted list instead of an arbitrary order list.

Please add the file containing the `decompose()` function to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.
