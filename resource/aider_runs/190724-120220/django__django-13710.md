#### Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Django allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.  
#### I have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.

To implement this change, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/contrib/admin/options.py` - This file contains the `InlineModelAdmin` class, which is responsible for handling inline models in the Django admin interface. We will need to update this class to set `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if it is specified.

2. `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py` - This file will contain the tests for the admin inline functionality. We will need to add tests to ensure that the `verbose_name_plural` is correctly set based on `verbose_name`.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Let's proceed with the changes.

1. Modify `InlineModelAdmin` in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to set `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if it is specified.
2. Add tests in `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py` to ensure the `verbose_name_plural` is correctly set based on `verbose_name`.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

### Modify `InlineModelAdmin` in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`

django/contrib/admin/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
=======
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            if self.verbose_name is not None:
                self.verbose_name_plural = f"{self.verbose_name}s"
            else:
                self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Add tests in `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py`

tests/admin_inlines/tests.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def test_both_verbose_names_inline(self):
=======
    def test_inline_verbose_name_plural_default(self):
        class CustomVerboseNameInline(TabularInline):
            model = Profile
            verbose_name = 'Custom Profile'

        modeladmin = ModelAdmin(ProfileCollection, admin_site)
        modeladmin.inlines = [CustomVerboseNameInline]
        obj = ProfileCollection.objects.create()
        url = reverse('admin:admin_inlines_profilecollection_change', args=(obj.pk,))
        request = self.factory.get(url)
        request.user = self.superuser
        response = modeladmin.changeform_view(request)
        self.assertContains(response, '<h2>Custom Profiles</h2>')
        self.assertContains(response, 'Add another Custom Profile')

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline class is based on the `verbose_name` if it is specified, and the tests will verify this behavior.
