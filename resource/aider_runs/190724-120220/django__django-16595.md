#### Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Let's consider the following operations:   
#### operations = [  
#### 	migrations.AddField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),  
#### 	),  
#### ]  
#### If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:  
#### optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books")   
#### [<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]  
#### Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField.   
#### Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented?   
#### Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like  
#### 		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(  
#### 			operation  
#### 		):  
#### 			return [operation]

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we will likely need to modify the optimizer logic. The most relevant file for this change is:

- `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we need to modify the `optimize_inner` method in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. Specifically, we need to add logic to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `optimize_inner` method to handle multiple `AlterField` operations.

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
=======
                elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name and operation.model_name == other.model_name):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if both the current operation and the other operation are `AlterField` operations on the same field, they will be reduced.

Let's implement this change. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
=======
                elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name and operation.model_name == other.model_name):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

>                 elif not result:  
> =======  
>                 elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name and operation.model_name == other.model_name):  
> >>>>>>> REPLACE  
>   
> Are you sure you need this SEARCH/REPLACE block?  
> The REPLACE lines are already in django/db/migrations/optimizer.py!  
>

>

> Don't re-send them.  
> Just reply with fixed versions of the block above that failed to match.

Let's correct the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to ensure it matches the existing code exactly. Here is the updated block:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name and operation.model_name == other.model_name):
=======
                elif not result:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
