#### "default.html" deprecation warning raised for ManagementForm's  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I have a project where I never render forms with the {{ form }} expression. However, I'm still getting the new template deprecation warning because of the formset management form production, during which the template used is insignificant (only hidden inputs are produced).  
#### Is it worth special-casing this and avoid producing the warning for the management forms?

To address the deprecation warning for `default.html` in `ManagementForm`, we will likely need to make changes in the following file:

- `django/forms/formsets.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

To address the deprecation warning for `default.html` in `ManagementForm`, we can special-case the management form rendering to avoid using the default template. We will modify the `ManagementForm` class to use a minimal template that does not raise the deprecation warning.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/forms/formsets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class ManagementForm(Form):
    """
    Keep track of how many form instances are displayed on the page. If adding
    new forms via JavaScript, you should increment the count field of this form
    as well.
    """

    TOTAL_FORMS = IntegerField(widget=HiddenInput)
    INITIAL_FORMS = IntegerField(widget=HiddenInput)
    # MIN_NUM_FORM_COUNT and MAX_NUM_FORM_COUNT are output with the rest of the
    # management form, but only for the convenience of client-side code. The
    # POST value of them returned from the client is not checked.
    MIN_NUM_FORMS = IntegerField(required=False, widget=HiddenInput)
    MAX_NUM_FORMS = IntegerField(required=False, widget=HiddenInput)

    def clean(self):
        cleaned_data = super().clean()
        # When the management form is invalid, we don't know how many forms
        # were submitted.
        cleaned_data.setdefault(TOTAL_FORM_COUNT, 0)
        cleaned_data.setdefault(INITIAL_FORM_COUNT, 0)
        return cleaned_data
