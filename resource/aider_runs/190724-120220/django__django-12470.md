#### Inherited model doesn't correctly order by "-pk" when specified on Parent.Meta.ordering  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Given the following model definition:  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class Parent(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		ordering = ["-pk"]  
#### class Child(Parent):  
#### 	pass  
#### Querying the Child class results in the following:  
#### >>> print(Child.objects.all().query)  
#### SELECT "myapp_parent"."id", "myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" FROM "myapp_child" INNER JOIN "myapp_parent" ON ("myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" = "myapp_parent"."id") ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" ASC  
#### The query is ordered ASC but I expect the order to be DESC.

To address the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, we will likely need to make changes to the Django ORM, specifically in the model options and query generation logic. The files most likely to need changes are:

1. `django/db/models/options.py` - This file handles the meta options for models, including ordering.
2. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - This file is responsible for generating SQL queries, including handling the ordering clauses.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, we need to ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly applied to the child model. This involves making changes to how the ordering is processed in the `Options` class and ensuring that the query generation respects this ordering.

Here are the changes needed:

1. **Update `django/db/models/options.py`**:
   - Ensure that the ordering from the parent model is correctly inherited by the child model.

2. **Update `django/db/models/sql/query.py`**:
   - Ensure that the query generation respects the inherited ordering.

Let's start with the changes to `django/db/models/options.py`:

django/db/models/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ordering = []
=======
        self.ordering = getattr(meta, 'ordering', [])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to ensure that the query respects this ordering in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.order_by = ()
=======
        self.order_by = self.get_meta().ordering or ()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly applied to the child model and respected during query generation.
