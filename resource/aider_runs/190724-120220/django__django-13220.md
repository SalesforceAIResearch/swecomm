#### Allow ValidationErrors to equal each other when created identically  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by kamni)  
#### 	   
#### Currently ValidationErrors (django.core.exceptions.ValidationError) that have identical messages don't equal each other, which is counter-intuitive, and can make certain kinds of testing more complicated. Please add an __eq__ method that allows two ValidationErrors to be compared.   
#### Ideally, this would be more than just a simple self.messages == other.messages. It would be most helpful if the comparison were independent of the order in which errors were raised in a field or in non_field_errors.

To implement the requested feature, we will need to modify the `ValidationError` class in the `django/core/exceptions.py` file to add an `__eq__` method. This method will allow two `ValidationError` instances to be compared for equality, considering the order of errors.

Please add the `django/core/exceptions.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Here are the changes needed to add an `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class to allow for equality comparison:

1. Add the `__eq__` method to the `ValidationError` class.
2. Ensure the comparison is independent of the order in which errors were raised.

django/core/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __repr__(self):
=======
    def __eq__(self, other):
        if not isinstance(other, ValidationError):
            return False
        if hasattr(self, 'error_dict') and hasattr(other, 'error_dict'):
            return (
                set(self.error_dict.keys()) == set(other.error_dict.keys()) and
                all(
                    sorted(self.error_dict[key]) == sorted(other.error_dict[key])
                    for key in self.error_dict
                )
            )
        if hasattr(self, 'error_list') and hasattr(other, 'error_list'):
            return sorted(self.error_list) == sorted(other.error_list)
        return False
