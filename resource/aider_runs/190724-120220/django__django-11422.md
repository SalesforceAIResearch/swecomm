#### Autoreloader with StatReloader doesn't track changes in manage.py.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)  
#### 	   
#### This is a bit convoluted, but here we go.  
#### Environment (OSX 10.11):  
#### $ python -V  
#### Python 3.6.2  
#### $ pip -V  
#### pip 19.1.1  
#### $ pip install Django==2.2.1  
#### Steps to reproduce:  
#### Run a server python manage.py runserver  
#### Edit the manage.py file, e.g. add print():   
#### def main():  
#### 	print('sth')  
#### 	os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'ticket_30479.settings')  
#### 	...  
#### Under 2.1.8 (and prior), this will trigger the auto-reloading mechanism. Under 2.2.1, it won't. As far as I can tell from the django.utils.autoreload log lines, it never sees the manage.py itself.

To address the issue with the autoreloader not tracking changes in `manage.py`, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `django/utils/autoreload.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To ensure that changes in `manage.py` are tracked by the autoreloader, we need to make sure that `manage.py` is included in the list of files being watched. We can achieve this by explicitly adding `manage.py` to the list of extra files to be watched.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Modify `django/utils/autoreload.py` to include `manage.py` in the list of extra files to be watched.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/utils/autoreload.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files))
=======
    manage_py_path = Path(sys.argv[0]).resolve()
    return iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files).union({manage_py_path}))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `manage.py` is explicitly added to the list of files being watched by the autoreloader.

> Applied edit to django/utils/autoreload.py
