#### uniq modifies list argument  
#### When you iterate over a dictionary or set and try to modify it while doing so you get an error from Python:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> multiset('THISTLE')  
#### {'T': 2, 'H': 1, 'I': 1, 'S': 1, 'L': 1, 'E': 1}  
#### >>> for i in _:  
#### ...   _.pop(i)  
#### ...  
#### 2  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
#### RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration  
#### ```  
#### It would be good to do the same thing from within `uniq` because the output will silently be wrong if you modify a passed list:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> f=list('THISTLE')  
#### >>> for i in uniq(f):  
#### ...   f.remove(i)  
#### ...   i  
#### ...  
#### 'T'  
#### 'I'  
#### 'L'  
#### ```  
#### I think this would entail recording the size at the start and then checking the size and raising a similar RuntimeError if the size changes.  
> 33663 prompt tokens, 70 completion tokens, $0.169365 cost  

To implement the requested change, we need to modify the `uniq` function to check the size of the list at the start and during iteration. This will ensure that if the list is modified, a `RuntimeError` is raised.

Please add the file that contains the `uniq` function to the chat, and I will provide the necessary changes.
