#### Filtering on query result overrides GROUP BY of internal query  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### from django.contrib.auth import models  
#### a = models.User.objects.filter(email__isnull=True).values('email').annotate(m=Max('id')).values('m')  
#### print(a.query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email"  
#### print(a[:1].query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email" LIMIT 1  
#### b = models.User.objects.filter(id=a[:1])  
#### print(b.query) # GROUP BY U0."id" should be GROUP BY U0."email"  
#### # SELECT ... FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."id" = (SELECT U0."id" FROM "auth_user" U0 WHERE U0."email" IS NULL GROUP BY U0."id" LIMIT 1)

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause in the query, the most likely file that will need changes is:

- `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause in the query, we need to ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause in the subquery is correctly maintained when filtering on the query result. This involves modifying the `get_aggregation` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if not self.is_sliced and not self.distinct_fields:
                # Queries with distinct_fields need ordering and when a limit
                # is applied we must take the slice from the ordered query.
                # Otherwise no need for ordering.
                inner_query.clear_ordering(True)
            if not inner_query.distinct:
                # If the inner query uses default select and it has some
                # aggregate annotations, then we must make sure the inner
                # query is grouped by the main model's primary key. However,
                # clearing the select clause can alter results if distinct is
                # used.
                has_existing_aggregate_annotations = any(
                    annotation for annotation in existing_annotations
                    if getattr(annotation, 'contains_aggregate', True)
                )
                if inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_aggregate_annotations:
                    inner_query.group_by = (self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias()),)
                inner_query.default_cols = False

            if not self.is_sliced and not self.distinct_fields:
                # Queries with distinct_fields need ordering and when a limit
                # is applied we must take the slice from the ordered query.
                # Otherwise no need for ordering.

                has_existing_aggregate_annotations = any(
                    annotation for annotation in existing_annotations
                    if getattr(annotation, 'contains_aggregate', True)
                )
                if inner_query.default_cols and has_existing_aggregate_annotations:
                    inner_query.group_by = tuple(
                        set(inner_query.group_by or ()) |
                        {self.model._meta.pk.get_col(inner_query.get_initial_alias())}
                    )
                inner_query.default_cols = False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `GROUP BY` clause in the subquery includes the necessary fields, preventing it from being overridden incorrectly.
