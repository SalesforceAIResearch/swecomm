#### Two sections called Symbols in index  
#### When using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `sphinx/writers/html.py` - This file is responsible for generating the HTML output, including the index sections.
2. `sphinx/util/nodes.py` - This file might contain utility functions for handling nodes, which could be relevant for fixing the index generation.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we need to:

1. Modify the logic that generates the index sections in `sphinx/writers/html.py` to ensure that all symbol entries are grouped together.
2. Ensure that the anchor names for the "Symbols" section are unique to avoid conflicts.

Here are the changes needed:

sphinx/writers/html.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class HTMLTranslator(SphinxTranslator, BaseTranslator):
    """
    Our custom HTML translator.
    """
=======
SYMBOLS_SECTION_NAME = "Symbols"

class HTMLTranslator(SphinxTranslator, BaseTranslator):
    """
    Our custom HTML translator.
    """
    def __init__(self, *args: Any) -> None:
        super().__init__(*args)
        self.symbols_section_added = False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sphinx/writers/html.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
        raise nodes.SkipNode
=======
    def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
        if not self.symbols_section_added:
            self.body.append(self.starttag(node, 'div', CLASS='section'))
            self.body.append('<h1>%s</h1>' % SYMBOLS_SECTION_NAME)
            self.symbols_section_added = True
        raise nodes.SkipNode
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that all symbol entries are grouped under a single "Symbols" section and that the section is only added once. If you need further modifications or if there are other files that need to be edited, please let me know.
