#### delete() on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Deleting any model with no dependencies not updates the PK on the model. It should be set to None after .delete() call.  
#### See Django.db.models.deletion:276-281. Should update the model line 280.

To address the issue where deleting a model instance with no dependencies does not clear its primary key, we need to modify the `delete()` method in the `django/db/models/base.py` file.

Please add the `django/db/models/base.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to ensure that the primary key is set to `None` after calling `delete()` on a model instance with no dependencies:

django/db/models/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return collector.delete()
=======
        result = collector.delete()
        if not keep_parents:
            self._state.adding = True
            self._state.db = None
            self.pk = None
        return result
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/db/models/base.py
