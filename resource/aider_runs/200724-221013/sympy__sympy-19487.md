#### Rewrite sign as abs  
#### In sympy the `sign` function is defined as  
#### ```  
####     sign(z)  :=  z / Abs(z)  
#### ```  
#### for all complex non-zero `z`. There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:  
#### ```  
#### >>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                     
####  x   
#### ───  
#### │x│  
#### ```  
#### I'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have  
#### ```  
#### >>> sign(0)                                                                                                                                 
#### 0  
#### >>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                              
#### nan  
#### ```  
#### Maybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).

To implement the requested changes, we will likely need to edit the following files:

1. `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` - This file contains the definition of the `sign` function.
2. `sympy/functions/elementary/tests/test_complexes.py` - This file likely contains tests for the `sign` function, and we will need to add tests for the new behavior.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Here are the changes needed to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of `Abs` and update the tests accordingly:

1. Update the `sign` function in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py` to include the rewrite method.
2. Add tests for the new behavior in `sympy/functions/elementary/tests/test_complexes.py`.

### Changes to `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise(self, arg, **kwargs):
=======
    def _eval_rewrite_as_Abs(self, arg, **kwargs):
        if arg.is_zero:
            return S.NaN
        return arg / Abs(arg)

    def _eval_rewrite_as_Piecewise(self, arg, **kwargs):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Changes to `sympy/functions/elementary/tests/test_complexes.py`

sympy/functions/elementary/tests/test_complexes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def test_as_real_imag():
=======
def test_sign_rewrite():
    x = Symbol('x')
    assert sign(x).rewrite(Abs) == x / Abs(x)
    assert sign(0).rewrite(Abs) == S.NaN
    assert sign(2).rewrite(Abs) == 1
    assert sign(-2).rewrite(Abs) == -1
    assert sign(I).rewrite(Abs) == I
    assert sign(-I).rewrite(Abs) == -I

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `sign` function can be rewritten in terms of `Abs` and that the new behavior is properly tested.
