#### partitions() reusing the output dictionaries  
#### The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring.   
####   
#### I'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way.

To address the issue with the `partitions()` iterator in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`, we will need to:

1. Modify the `partitions()` function to copy the dictionary before yielding it.

Please add the file `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

Here is the change to the `partitions()` function to ensure that the output dictionaries are copied before yielding:

sympy/utilities/iterables.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms
    else:
        yield ms
=======
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
    else:
        yield ms.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
