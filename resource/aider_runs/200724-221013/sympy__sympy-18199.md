#### nthroot_mod function misses one root of x = 0 mod p.  
#### When in the equation x**n = a mod p , when a % p == 0. Then x = 0 mod p is also a root of this equation. But right now `nthroot_mod` does not check for this condition. `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5 , 17)` has a root `0 mod 17`. But it does not return it.

To address the issue with the `nthroot_mod` function, we will likely need to edit the file where this function is defined. Based on the summaries provided, the most likely file to contain the `nthroot_mod` function is `sympy/ntheory/residue.py`.

Please add `sympy/ntheory/residue.py` to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.
