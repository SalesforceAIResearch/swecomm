#### sqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Simon Charette)  
#### 	   
#### The migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT ​if the migration is atomic and ​the schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.  
#### The issue can be addressed by  
#### Changing sqlmigrate ​assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.  
#### Adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on ​an existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.  
#### I marked the ticket as easy picking because I included the above guidelines but feel free to uncheck it if you deem it inappropriate.

To address the issue, we need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` to update the logic for `self.output_transaction`.
2. `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to add a test for the new behavior.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Update `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when setting `self.output_transaction`.
2. Add a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` and verify the behavior.

Let's start with the changes to `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`:

django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.output_transaction = migration.atomic
=======
        self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we add a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py`:

tests/migrations/test_commands.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration(self):
=======
    def test_sqlmigrate_for_non_atomic_migration(self):
        """
        Transaction wrappers aren't shown for non-atomic migrations.
        """
        out = io.StringIO()
        call_command("sqlmigrate", "migrations", "0001", stdout=out)
        output = out.getvalue().lower()
        queries = [q.strip() for q in output.splitlines()]
        if connection.ops.start_transaction_sql():
            self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)
        self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), queries)

    @override_settings(MIGRATION_MODULES={"migrations": "migrations.test_migrations"})
    def test_sqlmigrate_no_transactional_ddl(self):
        """
        sqlmigrate doesn't wrap output in BEGIN/COMMIT if the database
        doesn't support transactional DDL.
        """
        with mock.patch('django.db.connection.features.can_rollback_ddl', False):
            out = io.StringIO()
            call_command("sqlmigrate", "migrations", "0001", stdout=out)
            output = out.getvalue().lower()
            self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.start_transaction_sql().lower(), output)
            self.assertNotIn(connection.ops.end_transaction_sql().lower(), output)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `sqlmigrate` only wraps its output in `BEGIN/COMMIT` if the database supports transactional DDL and the migration is atomic. The new test will verify this behavior.
