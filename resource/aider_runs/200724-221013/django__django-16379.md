#### FileBasedCache has_key is susceptible to race conditions  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Marti Raudsepp)  
#### 	   
#### I received the exception from Django's cache framework:  
#### FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/app/var/cache/d729e4cf4ba88cba5a0f48e0396ec48a.djcache'  
#### [...]  
####  File "django/core/cache/backends/base.py", line 229, in get_or_set  
#### 	self.add(key, default, timeout=timeout, version=version)  
####  File "django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py", line 26, in add  
#### 	if self.has_key(key, version):  
####  File "django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py", line 94, in has_key  
#### 	with open(fname, "rb") as f:  
#### The code is:  
#### 	def has_key(self, key, version=None):  
#### 		fname = self._key_to_file(key, version)  
#### 		if os.path.exists(fname):  
#### 			with open(fname, "rb") as f:  
#### 				return not self._is_expired(f)  
#### 		return False  
#### Between the exists() check and open(), it's possible for the file to be deleted. In fact, the _is_expired() method itself deletes the file if it finds it to be expired. So if many threads race to read an expired cache at once, it's not that unlikely to hit this window.

To address the race condition in the `has_key` method of the `FileBasedCache` class, we need to modify the following file:

- `django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the race condition in the `has_key` method, we need to handle the potential `FileNotFoundError` that can occur between the `os.path.exists` check and the `open` call. Here are the changes:

django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def has_key(self, key, version=None):
        fname = self._key_to_file(key, version)
        if os.path.exists(fname):
            with open(fname, "rb") as f:
                return not self._is_expired(f)
        return False
=======
    def has_key(self, key, version=None):
        fname = self._key_to_file(key, version)
        try:
            with open(fname, "rb") as f:
                return not self._is_expired(f)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
