#### Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.  
#### This project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.  
#### This happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.  
#### When it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.  
#### NamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient arguments.  
#### The fix is to * expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.

To address the issue with named tuples causing errors when used as arguments to `__range` in Django 3.0, we need to modify the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file.

Please add the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

To fix the issue with named tuples causing errors when used as arguments to `__range` in Django 3.0, we need to modify the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. Specifically, we need to ensure that when reconstituting the tuple, we expand the contents of the iterator into the constructor.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
            # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need
            # to be resolved independently.
            return type(value)(
                self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)
                for sub_value in value
            )
=======
        elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
            # The items of the iterable may be expressions and therefore need
            # to be resolved independently.
            resolved_values = [
                self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)
                for sub_value in value
            ]
            if isinstance(value, tuple) and hasattr(value, '_fields'):  # Check if it's a namedtuple
                return type(value)(*resolved_values)
            return type(value)(resolved_values)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
