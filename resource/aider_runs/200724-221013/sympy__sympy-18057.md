#### Sympy incorrectly attempts to eval reprs in its __eq__ method

To address the issue with `__eq__` method in SymPy incorrectly attempting to evaluate `repr` strings, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `sympy/core/expr.py` - This file contains the `__eq__` method where the issue originates.
2. `sympy/core/sympify.py` - This file contains the `sympify` function which is called within the `__eq__` method.
3. `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` - This file contains the `parse_expr` and `eval_expr` functions which are involved in the evaluation process.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Let's start by addressing the issue in the `__eq__` method in `sympy/core/expr.py`. We will modify the `__eq__` method to avoid using `eval` on the `repr` of unknown objects.

Here are the changes:

sympy/core/expr.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        try:
            other = sympify(other)
            if not isinstance(other, Expr):
                return False
        except (SympifyError, SyntaxError):
            return False
=======
        if not isinstance(other, Expr):
            try:
                other = sympify(other, strict=True)
            except (SympifyError, SyntaxError):
                return False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to ensure that `sympify` does not attempt to evaluate `repr` strings of unknown objects. We will modify the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`.

sympy/core/sympify.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if isinstance(a, string_types):
        from sympy.parsing.sympy_parser import parse_expr
        return parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)
=======
    if isinstance(a, string_types) and not isinstance(a, repr):
        from sympy.parsing.sympy_parser import parse_expr
        return parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, we need to ensure that `parse_expr` and `eval_expr` in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py` handle the evaluation safely.

sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    expr = eval(
        code, global_dict, local_dict)  # take local objects in preference
=======
    try:
        expr = eval(
            code, global_dict, local_dict)  # take local objects in preference
    except AttributeError as e:
        raise SympifyError('Evaluation error', e)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should address the issue of SymPy incorrectly attempting to evaluate `repr` strings in its `__eq__` method.
