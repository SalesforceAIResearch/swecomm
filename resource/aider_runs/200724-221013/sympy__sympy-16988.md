#### Intersection should remove duplicates  
#### ```python  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{1},{x})  
#### EmptySet()  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{x})  
#### {1}  
#### ```  
#### The answer should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated.  
####   
#### The routine should give the same answer if duplicates are present; my initial guess is that duplicates should just be removed at the outset of instantiation. Ordering them will produce canonical processing.

To implement the requested changes, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `sympy/sets/sets.py`: This file likely contains the implementation of the `Intersection` class and its instantiation logic.
2. `sympy/sets/tests/test_sets.py`: This file likely contains the tests for the `Intersection` class, and we will need to add tests to ensure the new behavior is correct.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To implement the requested changes, we will:

1. Modify the `Intersection` class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation.
2. Add tests to `sympy/sets/tests/test_sets.py` to ensure the new behavior is correct.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Modify `Intersection` class in `sympy/sets/sets.py`

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))
=======
        # Remove duplicates
        args = list(ordered(set(args), Set._infimum_key))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Add tests to `sympy/sets/tests/test_sets.py`

sympy/sets/tests/test_sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def test_Complement():
=======
def test_intersection_duplicates():
    x = Symbol('x')
    assert Intersection(FiniteSet(1), FiniteSet(1), FiniteSet(x)) == \
        Piecewise((FiniteSet(1), Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))
    assert Intersection(FiniteSet(1), FiniteSet(x)) == FiniteSet(1)

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation and that the behavior is tested.
