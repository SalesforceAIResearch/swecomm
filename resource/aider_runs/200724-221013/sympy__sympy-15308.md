#### LaTeX printing for Matrix Expression  
#### ```py  
#### >>> A = MatrixSymbol("A", n, n)  
#### >>> latex(trace(A**2))  
#### 'Trace(A**2)'  
#### ```  
####   
#### The bad part is not only is Trace not recognized, but whatever printer is being used doesn't fallback to the LaTeX printer for the inner expression (it should be `A^2`).

To address the issue with LaTeX printing for `MatrixExpression`, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `sympy/printing/latex.py` - This file contains the `LatexPrinter` class, which is responsible for converting expressions to LaTeX format. We will need to add or modify the `_print_Trace` method to ensure it correctly prints the `Trace` object and falls back to the LaTeX printer for inner expressions.

Please add `sympy/printing/latex.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with LaTeX printing for `MatrixExpression`, we need to add a method to handle the `Trace` object in the `LatexPrinter` class. This method will ensure that the `Trace` object is correctly printed and that the inner expression falls back to the LaTeX printer.

Here are the changes:

1. Add a `_print_Trace` method to the `LatexPrinter` class.

sympy/printing/latex.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _print_Tr(self, p):
        #Todo: Handle indices
        contents = self._print(p.args[0])
        return r'\mbox{Tr}\left(%s\right)' % (contents)
=======
    def _print_Trace(self, expr):
        arg = self._print(expr.arg)
        return r'\operatorname{tr}\left(%s\right)' % arg

    def _print_Tr(self, p):
        #Todo: Handle indices
        contents = self._print(p.args[0])
        return r'\mbox{Tr}\left(%s\right)' % (contents)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the `Trace` object is correctly printed as `\operatorname{tr}` and that the inner expression is correctly handled by the LaTeX printer.
