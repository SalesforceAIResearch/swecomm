#### Confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings  
#### The comparison with assertion rewriting for byte strings is confusing:   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"42"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'42'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 52  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'42'  
#### E         ?   ++  
#### ```  
####   
#### 52 is the ASCII ordinal of "4" here.  
####   
#### It became clear to me when using another example:  
####   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"1"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'1'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 49  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'1'  
#### E         ?   +  
#### ```  
####   
#### Not sure what should/could be done here.

To address the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` - This file handles the assertion rewriting logic and is the most likely place where the message formatting for byte string comparisons can be improved.
2. `testing/test_assertrewrite.py` - This file contains tests for the assertion rewriting functionality and will need to be updated to include tests for the new behavior.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings, we will:

1. Modify the `_call_reprcompare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` to handle byte string comparisons more clearly.
2. Add tests in `testing/test_assertrewrite.py` to ensure the new behavior is correct.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Modify `_call_reprcompare` in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`

src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return expl
=======
    if isinstance(each_obj[i], bytes) and isinstance(each_obj[i + 1], bytes):
        custom = "assert {} == {}\n  Full diff:\n  - {}\n  + {}".format(
            saferepr(each_obj[i]), saferepr(each_obj[i + 1]),
            saferepr(each_obj[i]), saferepr(each_obj[i + 1])
        )
        return custom
    return expl
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Add tests in `testing/test_assertrewrite.py`

testing/test_assertrewrite.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def test_boolop(self):
=======
    def test_bytes_comparison(self):
        def f():
            assert b"" == b"42"

        assert getmsg(f) == (
            "assert b'' == b'42'\n"
            "  Full diff:\n"
            "  - b''\n"
            "  + b'42'"
        )

        def f():
            assert b"" == b"1"

        assert getmsg(f) == (
            "assert b'' == b'1'\n"
            "  Full diff:\n"
            "  - b''\n"
            "  + b'1'"
        )

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that byte string comparisons are handled more clearly in assertion messages.
