#### Inherited model doesn't correctly order by "-pk" when specified on Parent.Meta.ordering  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Given the following model definition:  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class Parent(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		ordering = ["-pk"]  
#### class Child(Parent):  
#### 	pass  
#### Querying the Child class results in the following:  
#### >>> print(Child.objects.all().query)  
#### SELECT "myapp_parent"."id", "myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" FROM "myapp_child" INNER JOIN "myapp_parent" ON ("myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" = "myapp_parent"."id") ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" ASC  
#### The query is ordered ASC but I expect the order to be DESC.

To address the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, we need to ensure that the ordering specified in the `Meta` class of the parent model is correctly applied to the child model. This involves modifying the `get_ordering` method in the `Query` class to handle inherited models properly.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Modify the `get_ordering` method to check for inherited models and apply the correct ordering.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def get_ordering(self):
    """
    Return a list defining the ordering of the query.

    This is a convenience method to access the ordering of the query. It
    can be used by the SQL compiler to determine the ORDER BY clause.

    The ordering returned is a list of strings. Each string is a field name
    with an optional '-' prefix, which indicates descending order.
    """
    if self.order_by:
        return self.order_by
    if self.default_ordering:
        return self.model._meta.ordering
    return []
=======
def get_ordering(self):
    """
    Return a list defining the ordering of the query.

    This is a convenience method to access the ordering of the query. It
    can be used by the SQL compiler to determine the ORDER BY clause.

    The ordering returned is a list of strings. Each string is a field name
    with an optional '-' prefix, which indicates descending order.
    """
    if self.order_by:
        return self.order_by
    if self.default_ordering:
        # Check if the model is inherited and apply the parent's ordering if necessary
        if self.model._meta.ordering:
            return self.model._meta.ordering
        for base in self.model._meta.get_parent_list():
            if base._meta.ordering:
                return base._meta.ordering
    return []
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the ordering specified in the `Meta` class of the parent model is correctly applied to the child model when querying.
