#### Possible bug in io.fits related to D exponents  
#### I came across the following code in ``fitsrec.py``:  
####   
#### ```python  
####         # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers  
####         if 'D' in format:  
####             output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))  
#### ```  
####   
#### I think this may be incorrect because as far as I can tell ``replace`` is not an in-place operation for ``chararray`` (it returns a copy). Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.

To address the potential bug in `fitsrec.py` related to the `D` exponents, we need to:

1. Correct the `replace` operation to ensure it modifies the `output_field` correctly.
2. Add or update tests to ensure this code is being tested.

The files most likely to need changes are:
1. `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` - to fix the `replace` operation.
2. `astropy/io/fits/tests/test_fitsrec.py` - to add or update tests for this functionality.

Please add `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` and `astropy/io/fits/tests/test_fitsrec.py` to the chat.

To fix the potential bug in `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py`, we need to ensure that the `replace` operation modifies the `output_field` correctly. We will use the `np.char.replace` function, which operates on the entire array and returns a new array. We will then assign this new array back to `output_field`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py`:

astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
=======
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field[...] = np.char.replace(output_field, encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to add or update tests to ensure this functionality is being tested. Please add `astropy/io/fits/tests/test_fitsrec.py` to the chat.
