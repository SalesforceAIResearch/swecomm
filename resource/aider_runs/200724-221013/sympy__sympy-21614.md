#### Wrong Derivative kind attribute  
#### I'm playing around with the `kind` attribute.  
####   
#### The following is correct:  
####   
#### ```  
#### from sympy import Integral, Derivative  
#### from sympy import MatrixSymbol  
#### from sympy.abc import x  
#### A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2)  
#### i = Integral(A, x)  
#### i.kind  
#### # MatrixKind(NumberKind)  
#### ```  
####   
#### This one is wrong:  
#### ```  
#### d = Derivative(A, x)  
#### d.kind  
#### # UndefinedKind  
#### ```

To address the issue with the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` class, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `sympy/core/function.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` class, we need to ensure that the `kind` attribute is correctly set for `Derivative` instances. We will modify the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` to correctly set the `kind` attribute based on the expression and the variables of differentiation.

Here are the changes:

sympy/core/function.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __new__(cls, expr, *variables, **kwargs):
=======
    def __new__(cls, expr, *variables, **kwargs):
        from sympy.matrices.expressions.matexpr import MatrixKind
        from sympy.core.kind import NumberKind

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/core/function.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return expr
=======
        return expr

    @property
    def kind(self):
        from sympy.matrices.expressions.matexpr import MatrixKind
        from sympy.core.kind import NumberKind

        if isinstance(self.expr.kind, MatrixKind):
            return MatrixKind(NumberKind)
        return self.expr.kind
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` instances is correctly set based on the expression and the variables of differentiation.
