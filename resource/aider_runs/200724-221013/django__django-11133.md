#### HttpResponse doesn't handle memoryview objects  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I am trying to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:  
#### from django.http import HttpResponse																	   
#### # String content  
#### response = HttpResponse("My Content")																			  
#### response.content																								   
#### # Out: b'My Content'  
#### # This is correct  
#### # Bytes content  
#### response = HttpResponse(b"My Content")																		   
#### response.content																								   
#### # Out: b'My Content'  
#### # This is also correct  
#### # memoryview content  
#### response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))															   
#### response.content  
#### # Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'  
#### # This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'

To handle `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`, we will likely need to modify the `django/http/response.py` file. This file contains the `HttpResponse` class and its handling of content.

Please add the `django/http/response.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To handle `memoryview` objects in `HttpResponse`, we need to modify the `content` property setter in the `HttpResponse` class to properly handle `memoryview` objects. 

Here are the necessary changes:

django/http/response.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
=======
        if isinstance(value, memoryview):
            content = self.make_bytes(value.tobytes())
        elif hasattr(value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(value, (bytes, str)):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if the content is a `memoryview` object, it will be converted to bytes before being assigned to the response content.
