#### Add check for fields of UniqueConstraints.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Marnanel Thurman)  
#### 	   
#### When a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist.  
#### This is in contrast to the older unique_together syntax, which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.  
#### In the attached demonstration, you'll need to uncomment "with_unique_together" in settings.py in order to show that unique_together raises E012.

To add a check for fields of `UniqueConstraints`, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/db/models/base.py` - This file contains the `Model` class and its `check` method, which is responsible for running checks on the model.
2. `django/core/checks/models.py` - This file contains the checks for models, including the existing check for `unique_together`.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add the check for fields of `UniqueConstraints`, we need to modify the `django/core/checks/models.py` file. This file contains the checks for models, including the existing check for `unique_together`.

Please add the `django/core/checks/models.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.
