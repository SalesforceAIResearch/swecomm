#### Two sections called Symbols in index  
#### When using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we will likely need to modify the code responsible for generating the index entries and their sections. The most probable files that need changes are:

1. `sphinx/builders/html.py` - This file likely contains the logic for generating the HTML output, including the index sections.
2. `sphinx/writers/html.py` - This file might be responsible for writing the HTML content, including handling the index entries.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we need to modify the logic that generates the index sections. Specifically, we need to ensure that all symbol entries are grouped under a single "Symbols" section.

Let's start by modifying the `sphinx/writers/html.py` file to handle this correctly.

sphinx/writers/html.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
    raise nodes.SkipNode
=======
def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
    # Group all symbol entries under a single "Symbols" section
    for entry in node['entries']:
        if entry[0] in {'symbol', 'symbols'}:
            entry[0] = 'Symbols'
    raise nodes.SkipNode
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that all symbol entries are grouped under a single "Symbols" section. If further changes are needed in other files, please let me know their full path names and add them to the chat.
