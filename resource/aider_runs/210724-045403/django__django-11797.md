#### Filtering on query result overrides GROUP BY of internal query  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### from django.contrib.auth import models  
#### a = models.User.objects.filter(email__isnull=True).values('email').annotate(m=Max('id')).values('m')  
#### print(a.query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email"  
#### print(a[:1].query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email" LIMIT 1  
#### b = models.User.objects.filter(id=a[:1])  
#### print(b.query) # GROUP BY U0."id" should be GROUP BY U0."email"  
#### # SELECT ... FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."id" = (SELECT U0."id" FROM "auth_user" U0 WHERE U0."email" IS NULL GROUP BY U0."id" LIMIT 1)

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause being overridden, the most likely file that will need changes is:

- `django/db/models/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause being overridden, we need to ensure that the internal query's `GROUP BY` clause is preserved when filtering on the query result. This involves modifying the `django/db/models/query.py` file to handle this case correctly.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Modify the `resolve_expression` method to ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause is preserved.

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        query = self.query.resolve_expression(*args, **kwargs)
=======
        query = self.query.resolve_expression(*args, **kwargs).clone()
        if query.group_by:
            query.group_by = self.query.group_by
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when the query is resolved, the `GROUP BY` clause from the original query is preserved in the cloned query.

Please apply this change to the `django/db/models/query.py` file.
