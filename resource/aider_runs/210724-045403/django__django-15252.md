#### MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Hi,  
#### We have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following:   
#### class Router(object):  
#### 	def allow_migrate(self, db, model):  
#### 		if db == 'default':  
#### 			return True  
#### 		return False  
#### Current Behaviour  
#### We run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)  
#### When this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied).   
#### The first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish).   
#### ensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table.   
#### I believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.

To address the issue with `MigrationRecorder` not obeying `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods like `record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, and `ensure_schema`.
2. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` - This file contains the `create_test_db` method which is called during the test database setup.
3. `django/test/runner.py` - This file contains the `setup_databases` method which calls the `create_test_db` method.

Please add the following files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes:

1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`
2. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`
3. `django/test/runner.py`

To ensure that `MigrationRecorder` obeys the `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we need to:

1. Modify the `MigrationRecorder` class to check the `allow_migrate` method of the router before creating or modifying the migration table.
2. Update the `create_test_db` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` to respect the router rules.
3. Ensure that the `setup_databases` method in `django/test/runner.py` respects the router rules.

Here are the necessary changes:

### 1. Update `MigrationRecorder` to respect `db_router` allow_migrate rules

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.apps.registry import Apps
from django.db import DatabaseError, models
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
from django.utils.timezone import now

from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing
=======
from django.apps.registry import Apps
from django.db import DatabaseError, models, router
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
from django.utils.timezone import now

from .exceptions import MigrationSchemaMissing
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema
        # in the codebase.
        if self.has_table():
            return
        # Make the table
        try:
            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                editor.create_model(self.Migration)
        except DatabaseError as exc:
            raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
=======
        # Check if migrations are allowed on this database
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            # If the table's there, that's fine - we've never changed its schema
            # in the codebase.
            if self.has_table():
                return
            # Make the table
            try:
                with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                    editor.create_model(self.Migration)
            except DatabaseError as exc:
                raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 2. Update `create_test_db` to respect `db_router` allow_migrate rules

django/db/backends/base/creation.py
```python
import os
import sys
from io import StringIO
from unittest import expectedFailure, skip

from django.apps import apps
from django.conf import settings
from django.core import serializers
from django.db import router
from django.db.transaction import atomic
from django.utils.module_loading import import_string

# The prefix to put on the default database name when creating
# the test database.
TEST_DATABASE_PREFIX = 'test_'
```

django/db/backends/base/creation.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            call_command(
                'migrate',
                verbosity=max(verbosity - 1, 0),
                interactive=False,
                database=self.connection.alias,
                run_syncdb=True,
            )
=======
            if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, None):
                call_command(
                    'migrate',
                    verbosity=max(verbosity - 1, 0),
                    interactive=False,
                    database=self.connection.alias,
                    run_syncdb=True,
                )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 3. Update `setup_databases` to respect `db_router` allow_migrate rules

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        with self.time_keeper.timed('Total database setup'):
            old_config = self.setup_databases(
                aliases=databases,
                serialized_aliases=serialized_aliases,
            )
=======
        with self.time_keeper.timed('Total database setup'):
            old_config = self.setup_databases(
                aliases={alias: serialize for alias, serialize in databases.items() if router.allow_migrate(alias, None)},
                serialized_aliases=serialized_aliases,
            )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `MigrationRecorder`, `create_test_db`, and `setup_databases` methods respect the `db_router` allow_migrate rules.

To fix the error, we need to import the `router` module in `django/test/runner.py`. Here is the necessary change:

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.core.management import call_command
=======
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.db import router
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `router` module is available when we use it in the `run_tests` method.
