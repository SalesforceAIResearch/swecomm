#### Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Error message:  
#### table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.  
#### We have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.  
#### We have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.   
#### Is this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.

To address the issue of having multiple models with the same `db_table` name in different apps, we will likely need to modify the model definitions in the respective apps to ensure unique table names or handle the database routing correctly.

The files most likely to need changes are:
1. `base/models.py` (or wherever the `ModelName` in the base app is defined)
2. `app2/models.py` (or wherever the `ModelName` in app2 is defined)
3. `settings.py` (to ensure proper database routing if needed)

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.
