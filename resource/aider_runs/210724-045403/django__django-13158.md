#### QuerySet.none() on combined queries returns all results.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I came across this issue on Stack Overflow. I'm not 100% sure it's a bug, but it does seem strange. With this code (excuse the bizarre example filtering):  
#### class Publication(models.Model):  
#### 	pass  
#### class Article(models.Model):  
#### 	publications = models.ManyToManyField(to=Publication, blank=True, null=True)  
#### class ArticleForm(forms.ModelForm):  
#### 	publications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(  
#### 		Publication.objects.filter(id__lt=2) | Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5),  
#### 		required=False,  
#### 	)  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		model = Article  
#### 		fields = ["publications"]  
#### class ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):  
#### 	form = ArticleForm  
#### This works well. However, changing the ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset to use union() breaks things.  
#### publications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(  
#### 	Publication.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(  
#### 		Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5)  
#### 	),  
#### 	required=False,  
#### )  
#### The form correctly shows only the matching objects. However, if you submit this form while empty (i.e. you didn't select any publications), ALL objects matching the queryset will be added. Using the OR query, NO objects are added, as I'd expect.

To address the issue with `QuerySet.none()` on combined queries returning all results, we will likely need to make changes in the following files:

1. `django/db/models/query.py` - This file contains the `QuerySet` class and its methods, including `none()`, which is where the issue likely resides.

Please add `django/db/models/query.py` to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `QuerySet.none()` on combined queries returning all results, we need to modify the `none()` method in the `QuerySet` class to ensure it correctly handles combined queries.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `none()` method to set the query to empty even for combined queries.

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        clone.query.set_empty()
=======
        if self.query.combinator:
            clone.query = self.model._base_manager.none().query
        else:
            clone.query.set_empty()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that when `none()` is called on a combined query, it correctly sets the query to empty, preventing any results from being returned.

> Applied edit to django/db/models/query.py
