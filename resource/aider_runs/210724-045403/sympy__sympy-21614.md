#### Wrong Derivative kind attribute  
#### I'm playing around with the `kind` attribute.  
####   
#### The following is correct:  
####   
#### ```  
#### from sympy import Integral, Derivative  
#### from sympy import MatrixSymbol  
#### from sympy.abc import x  
#### A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2)  
#### i = Integral(A, x)  
#### i.kind  
#### # MatrixKind(NumberKind)  
#### ```  
####   
#### This one is wrong:  
#### ```  
#### d = Derivative(A, x)  
#### d.kind  
#### # UndefinedKind  
#### ```

To address the issue with the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` class, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `sympy/core/function.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` class, we need to ensure that the `kind` attribute is correctly set for `Derivative` instances. This involves modifying the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py`.

Here are the changes we need to make:

1. Add the `kind` property to the `Derivative` class to correctly determine the kind based on the expression and the variables.

Let's proceed with the changes:

sympy/core/function.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class Derivative(Expr):
    """
    Carries out differentiation of the given expression with respect to symbols.
    ========
    """
    is_Derivative = True
=======
class Derivative(Expr):
    """
    Carries out differentiation of the given expression with respect to symbols.
    ========
    """
    is_Derivative = True

    @property
    def kind(self):
        from sympy.core.kind import UndefinedKind, MatrixKind, NumberKind
        expr_kind = self.expr.kind
        if expr_kind is UndefinedKind:
            return UndefinedKind
        for var in self.variables:
            if var.kind is UndefinedKind:
                return UndefinedKind
        return MatrixKind(NumberKind) if expr_kind is MatrixKind else expr_kind
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a `kind` property to the `Derivative` class, which correctly determines the kind based on the expression and the variables. If the expression or any of the variables have an `UndefinedKind`, the `kind` will be `UndefinedKind`. Otherwise, it will return the appropriate kind, including handling the case for `MatrixKind`.

With this change, the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` instances should now be correctly set.

Thank you for providing the correct lines. Let's try again with the exact match for the `Derivative` class.

sympy/core/function.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return repl_dict


class Derivative(Expr):
    """
    Carries out differentiation of the given expression with respect to symbols.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Derivative, Function, symbols, Subs
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> f, g = symbols('f g', cls=Function)
=======
        return repl_dict


class Derivative(Expr):
    """
    Carries out differentiation of the given expression with respect to symbols.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import Derivative, Function, symbols, Subs
    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> f, g = symbols('f g', cls=Function)

    is_Derivative = True

    @property
    def kind(self):
        from sympy.core.kind import UndefinedKind, MatrixKind, NumberKind
        expr_kind = self.expr.kind
        if expr_kind is UndefinedKind:
            return UndefinedKind
        for var in self.variables:
            if var.kind is UndefinedKind:
                return UndefinedKind
        return MatrixKind(NumberKind) if expr_kind is MatrixKind else expr_kind
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds the `kind` property to the `Derivative` class, ensuring that the `kind` attribute is correctly set based on the expression and the variables.
