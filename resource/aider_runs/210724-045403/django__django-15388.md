#### Dev Server fails to restart after adding BASE_DIR to TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'] in settings  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Repro steps:  
#### $ pip install -U django  
#### $ django-admin startproject <name>  
#### Open settings.py, copy the BASE_DIR variable from line 16 and paste it into the empty DIRS list on line 57  
#### $ ./manage.py runserver  
#### Back in your IDE, save a file and watch the dev server *NOT* restart.  
#### Back in settings.py, remove BASE_DIR from the templates DIRS list. Manually CTRL-C your dev server (as it won't restart on its own when you save), restart the dev server. Now return to your settings.py file, re-save it, and notice the development server once again detects changes and restarts.  
#### This bug prevents the dev server from restarting no matter where you make changes - it is not just scoped to edits to settings.py.

To address the issue with the dev server not restarting after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in `settings.py`, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `settings.py` - To ensure the `BASE_DIR` is correctly added to the `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` list.
2. `django/utils/autoreload.py` - This file handles the auto-reloading mechanism for the development server and might need adjustments to correctly detect changes when `BASE_DIR` is included in the templates directory.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the dev server not restarting after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']`, we need to ensure that the autoreloader correctly watches the directories specified in the `TEMPLATES` setting.

We will make the following changes to `django/utils/autoreload.py`:

1. Modify the `iter_all_python_module_files` function to include directories specified in the `TEMPLATES` setting.
2. Ensure that the `BASE_DIR` and any other directories in `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` are watched for changes.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/utils/autoreload.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.conf import settings
=======
from django.conf import settings
from pathlib import Path
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/utils/autoreload.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files))
=======
    template_dirs = [Path(d).resolve() for d in settings.TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']]
    return iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files).union(template_dirs))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the directories specified in `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` are included in the list of files and directories to be watched by the autoreloader. This should resolve the issue with the dev server not restarting when changes are made to files in these directories.
