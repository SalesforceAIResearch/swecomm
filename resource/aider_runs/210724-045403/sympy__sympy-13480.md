To address the issue with `coth(log(tan(x))).subs(x, 2)`, the most likely file that needs changes is:

- `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with `coth(log(tan(x))).subs(x, 2)`, we need to correct the variable name `cotm` to `cothm` in the `eval` method of the `coth` class.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:
=======
                    if cothm is S.ComplexInfinity:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
