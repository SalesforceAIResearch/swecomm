#### nthroot_mod function misses one root of x = 0 mod p.  
#### When in the equation x**n = a mod p , when a % p == 0. Then x = 0 mod p is also a root of this equation. But right now `nthroot_mod` does not check for this condition. `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5 , 17)` has a root `0 mod 17`. But it does not return it.

To address the issue with the `nthroot_mod` function, we need to modify the function to check if `a % p == 0` and include `0` as a root when this condition is met.

The file most likely to need changes is:
- `sympy/ntheory/residue.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.
