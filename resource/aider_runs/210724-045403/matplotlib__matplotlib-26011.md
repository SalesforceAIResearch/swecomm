#### xlim_changed not emitted on shared axis  
#### <!--To help us understand and resolve your issue, please fill out the form to the best of your ability.-->

####   
#### ### Bug report  
####   
#### **Bug summary**  
####   
#### When an axis is shared with another its registered "xlim_changed" callbacks does not get called when the change is induced by a shared axis (via sharex=).   
####   
#### In _base.py the set_xlim for sibling axis are called with emit=False:  
####   
#### ```  
#### matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py:  
####   
#### /.../  
#### def set_xlim(...)  
#### /.../  
####         if emit:  
####             self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)  
####             # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one  
####             for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):  
####                 if other is not self:  
####                     other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,  
####                                    emit=False, auto=auto)  
#### ```  
####   
#### I'm very new to matplotlib, so perhaps there is a good reason for this? emit=False seems to disable both continued "inheritance" of axis (why?) and triggering of change callbacks (looking at the code above).  
####   
#### It seems like one would at least want to trigger the xlim_changed callbacks as they would be intended to react to any change in axis limits.  
####   
#### Edit: Setting emit=True seems to introduce a recursion issue (not sure why but as inheritance seems to be passed along anyway it doesn't really matter). Moving the callback call to outside of the "if emit:"-statement seems to solve the issue as far as I can see when trying it out. Any reason to keep it inside the if-statement?

To address the issue where `xlim_changed` is not emitted on a shared axis, we will need to modify the `set_xlim` method in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` file.

Please add the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

Here is the proposed change to ensure that `xlim_changed` is emitted on shared axes:

lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if emit:
            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
            # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
            for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
                if other is not self:
                    other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                                   emit=False, auto=auto)
=======
        # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                               emit=False, auto=auto)
        if emit:
            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's try again with a more precise *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if emit:
            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                               emit=False, auto=auto)
=======
        # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                               emit=False, auto=auto)
        if emit:
            self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
