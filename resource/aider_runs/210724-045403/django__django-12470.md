#### Inherited model doesn't correctly order by "-pk" when specified on Parent.Meta.ordering  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Given the following model definition:  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class Parent(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		ordering = ["-pk"]  
#### class Child(Parent):  
#### 	pass  
#### Querying the Child class results in the following:  
#### >>> print(Child.objects.all().query)  
#### SELECT "myapp_parent"."id", "myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" FROM "myapp_child" INNER JOIN "myapp_parent" ON ("myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" = "myapp_parent"."id") ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" ASC  
#### The query is ordered ASC but I expect the order to be DESC.

To address the issue with the ordering in inherited models, we will likely need to make changes to the Django ORM, specifically in the model options and query construction logic. The files most likely to need changes are:

1. `django/db/models/options.py` - This file handles the model options, including the `ordering` attribute.
2. `django/db/models/sql/query.py` - This file constructs the SQL queries, including the `ORDER BY` clause.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the ordering in inherited models, we need to ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly applied to the child model. This involves making changes to how the ordering is inherited and applied in the query construction.

Here are the steps we will take:

1. Modify `django/db/models/options.py` to ensure that the ordering is correctly inherited from the parent model.
2. Modify `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to ensure that the ordering is correctly applied in the SQL query.

Let's start with the changes to `django/db/models/options.py`.

### Step 1: Modify `django/db/models/options.py`

We need to ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly inherited by the child model.

#### *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `django/db/models/options.py`

django/db/models/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.order_with_respect_to:
            # The app registry will not be ready at this point, so we cannot
            # use get_field().
            query = self.order_with_respect_to
            try:
                self.order_with_respect_to = next(
                    f for f in self._get_fields(reverse=False)
                    if f.name == query or f.attname == query
                )
            except StopIteration:
                raise FieldDoesNotExist("%s has no field named '%s'" % (self.object_name, query))

            self.ordering = ('_order',)
            if not any(isinstance(field, OrderWrt) for field in model._meta.local_fields):
                model.add_to_class('_order', OrderWrt())
        else:
            self.order_with_respect_to = None
=======
        if self.order_with_respect_to:
            # The app registry will not be ready at this point, so we cannot
            # use get_field().
            query = self.order_with_respect_to
            try:
                self.order_with_respect_to = next(
                    f for f in self._get_fields(reverse=False)
                    if f.name == query or f.attname == query
                )
            except StopIteration:
                raise FieldDoesNotExist("%s has no field named '%s'" % (self.object_name, query))

            self.ordering = ('_order',)
            if not any(isinstance(field, OrderWrt) for field in model._meta.local_fields):
                model.add_to_class('_order', OrderWrt())
        else:
            self.order_with_respect_to = None

        # Ensure ordering is inherited from the parent model if not explicitly set
        if not self.ordering and self.parents:
            for parent in self.parents:
                if parent._meta.ordering:
                    self.ordering = parent._meta.ordering
                    break
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Modify `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

We need to ensure that the ordering is correctly applied in the SQL query.

#### *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.order_by = rhs.order_by or self.order_by
=======
        self.order_by = rhs.order_by or self.order_by
        # Ensure ordering is applied correctly for inherited models
        if not self.order_by and self.model._meta.ordering:
            self.order_by = self.model._meta.ordering
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly inherited and applied in the child model's queries.
