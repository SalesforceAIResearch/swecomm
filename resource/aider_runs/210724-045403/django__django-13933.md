#### ModelChoiceField does not provide value of invalid choice when raising ValidationError  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Aaron Wiegel)  
#### 	   
#### Compared with ChoiceField and others, ModelChoiceField does not show the value of the invalid choice when raising a validation error. Passing in parameters with the invalid value and modifying the default error message for the code invalid_choice should fix this.  
#### From source code:  
#### class ModelMultipleChoiceField(ModelChoiceField):  
#### 	"""A MultipleChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""  
#### 	widget = SelectMultiple  
#### 	hidden_widget = MultipleHiddenInput  
#### 	default_error_messages = {  
#### 		'invalid_list': _('Enter a list of values.'),  
#### 		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the'  
#### 							' available choices.'),  
#### 		'invalid_pk_value': _('“%(pk)s” is not a valid value.')  
#### 	}  
#### 	...  
#### class ModelChoiceField(ChoiceField):  
#### 	"""A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""  
#### 	# This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't  
#### 	# actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.  
#### 	default_error_messages = {  
#### 		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of'  
#### 							' the available choices.'),  
#### 	}

To address the issue with `ModelChoiceField` not providing the value of the invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`, we will need to modify the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid value in the error message.

The most likely file that needs to be changed is:
- `django/forms/fields.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `ModelChoiceField` not providing the value of the invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`, we will modify the `ModelChoiceField` class to include the invalid value in the error message.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/forms/fields.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class ModelChoiceField(ChoiceField):
    """A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
    # This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't
    # actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.
    default_error_messages = {
        'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of'
                            ' the available choices.'),
    }
=======
class ModelChoiceField(ChoiceField):
    """A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
    # This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't
    # actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.
    default_error_messages = {
        'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of'
                            ' the available choices.'),
    }
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the `invalid_choice` error message to include the invalid value.

Let's ensure we capture the exact lines from the `ModelChoiceField` class. Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/forms/fields.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

    """A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
    # This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't
    # actually use any of ChoiceField's implementation.
    default_error_messages = {
        'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of'
                            ' the available choices.'),
    }

class ModelChoiceField(Field):
    """A ChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
    # This class is a subclass of ChoiceField for purity, but it doesn't

    default_error_messages = {
        'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of'
                            ' the available choices.'),
