#### Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Hi.  
#### The SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my "order by" clause, because he "thinks" the clause was already "seen" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same.   
#### The bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:  
#### without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)  
#### The sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompiler.get_order_by().  
#### As a quick/temporal fix I can suggest making sql variable clean of newline characters, like this:  
#### sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\n'))  
#### without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)  
#### Note: beware of unicode (Py2.x u'') and EOL dragons (\r).  
#### Example of my query:  
#### 	return MyModel.objects.all().order_by(  
#### 		RawSQL('''  
#### 			case when status in ('accepted', 'verification')  
#### 				 then 2 else 1 end''', []).desc(),  
#### 		RawSQL('''  
#### 			case when status in ('accepted', 'verification')  
#### 				 then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime)  
#### 				 else null end''', []).asc(),  
#### 		RawSQL('''  
#### 			case when status not in ('accepted', 'verification')  
#### 				 then (accepted_datetime, preferred_datetime, created_at)  
#### 				 else null end''', []).desc())  
#### The ordering_parts.search is returing accordingly:  
#### '				 then 2 else 1 end)'  
#### '				 else null end'  
#### '				 else null end'  
#### Second RawSQL with a				 else null end part is removed from query.  
#### The fun thing is that the issue can be solved by workaround by adding a space or any other char to the last line.   
#### So in case of RawSQL I can just say, that current implementation of avoiding duplicates in order by clause works only for special/rare cases (or does not work in all cases).   
#### The bug filed here is about wrong identification of duplicates (because it compares only last line of SQL passed to order by clause).  
#### Hope my notes will help you fixing the issue. Sorry for my english.

To address the issue with the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method incorrectly removing one of the "order by" clauses due to multiline `RawSQL` expressions, we will need to modify the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file.

Please add the `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

Here are the necessary changes to address the issue with the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method:

django/db/models/sql/compiler.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)
=======
            sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\n'))
            without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `sql` variable is cleaned of newline characters before applying the regular expression, which should prevent the incorrect removal of "order by" clauses in multiline `RawSQL` expressions.
