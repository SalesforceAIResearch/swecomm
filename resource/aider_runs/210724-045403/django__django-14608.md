#### Add `nonform` CSS class for non form errors in FormSets  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Ties Jan Hefting)  
#### 	   
#### Forms add the nonfield CSS class for non field errors in ErrorList instances. This is documented in a section on â€‹rendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.

To add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `django/forms/formsets.py` - This file handles the logic for formsets and is where we would add the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors.
2. `django/forms/utils.py` - This file contains the `ErrorList` class, which might need to be updated to handle the new `nonform` CSS class.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, we need to:

1. Update the `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` to use the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors.
2. Ensure that the `ErrorList` class in `django/forms/utils.py` can handle the new `nonform` CSS class.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Update `BaseFormSet` in `django/forms/formsets.py`

django/forms/formsets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._non_form_errors = self.error_class()
=======
        self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(error_class='nonform')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Ensure `ErrorList` can handle the new `nonform` CSS class in `django/forms/utils.py`

django/forms/utils.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            self.error_class = 'errorlist'
=======
            self.error_class = 'errorlist'
        elif 'nonform' in error_class:
            self.error_class = error_class
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that non-form errors in FormSets are rendered with the `nonform` CSS class, allowing for better distinction and styling.
