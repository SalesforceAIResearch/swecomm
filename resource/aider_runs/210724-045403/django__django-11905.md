#### Prevent using __isnull lookup with non-boolean value.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)  
#### 	   
#### __isnull should not allow for non-boolean values. Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is â€‹undocumented and untested. IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.

To implement the requested change, we will likely need to modify the file that handles query lookups in Django. The most probable file for this change is:

- `django/db/models/lookups.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To prevent using the `__isnull` lookup with non-boolean values, we need to modify the `IsNull` class in `django/db/models/lookups.py`. Specifically, we will add a check in the `as_sql` method to ensure that the `rhs` value is a boolean.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/models/lookups.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
=======
    def as_sql(self, compiler, connection):
        if not isinstance(self.rhs, bool):
            raise ValueError('The value for __isnull must be a boolean.')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will raise a `ValueError` if a non-boolean value is used with the `__isnull` lookup, ensuring that only boolean values are allowed.
