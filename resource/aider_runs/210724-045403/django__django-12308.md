#### JSONField are not properly displayed in admin when they are readonly.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### JSONField values are displayed as dict when readonly in the admin.  
#### For example, {"foo": "bar"} would be displayed as {'foo': 'bar'}, which is not valid JSON.  
#### I believe the fix would be to add a special case in django.contrib.admin.utils.display_for_field to call the prepare_value of the JSONField (not calling json.dumps directly to take care of the InvalidJSONInput case).

To address the issue with `JSONField` values being displayed as dicts when readonly in the admin, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `JSONField` values being displayed as dicts when readonly in the admin, we will modify the `display_for_field` function in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` to handle `JSONField` properly.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/contrib/admin/utils.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    elif isinstance(field, models.FileField) and value:
=======
    elif isinstance(field, models.JSONField):
        return field.value_to_string(None, value)
    elif isinstance(field, models.FileField) and value:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `JSONField` values are properly converted to JSON strings when displayed as readonly in the admin interface.

> Applied edit to django/contrib/admin/utils.py
