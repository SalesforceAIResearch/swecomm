#### Python 2->3 pickle fails with float-containing expressions  
#### Dumping a pickled sympy expression containing a float in Python 2, then loading it in Python 3 generates an error.  
####   
#### Here is a minimum working example, verified with sympy git commit 3546ac7 (master at time of writing), Python 2.7 and Python 3.6:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### python2 -c 'import pickle; import sympy; x = sympy.symbols("x"); print pickle.dumps(x + 1.0, 2)' | python3 -c 'import pickle; import sys; print(pickle.loads(sys.stdin.buffer.read()))'  
#### ```  
####   
#### and the result:  
####   
#### ```  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>  
####   File "/Users/alex/git/VU/sympy/sympy/core/numbers.py", line 1045, in __new__  
####     num[1] = long(num[1], 16)  
#### ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'  
#### ```

To address the issue with pickling and unpickling float-containing expressions between Python 2 and Python 3, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `sympy/core/numbers.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with pickling and unpickling float-containing expressions between Python 2 and Python 3, we need to modify the `__new__` method of the `Float` class in `sympy/core/numbers.py`. Specifically, we need to handle the case where the `num[1]` value is a string that ends with 'L', which is a long integer representation in Python 2.

Here are the changes:

sympy/core/numbers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if type(num[1]) is str:
                # it's a hexadecimal (coming from a pickled object)
                # assume that it is in standard form
                num = list(num)
                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)
=======
            if isinstance(num[1], str):
                # it's a hexadecimal (coming from a pickled object)
                # assume that it is in standard form
                num = list(num)
                if num[1].endswith('L'):
                    num[1] = int(num[1][:-1], 16)
                else:
                    num[1] = int(num[1], 16)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the 'L' suffix is removed before converting the string to an integer, making it compatible with Python 3.
