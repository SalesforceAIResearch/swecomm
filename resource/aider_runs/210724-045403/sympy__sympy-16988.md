#### Intersection should remove duplicates  
#### ```python  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{1},{x})  
#### EmptySet()  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{x})  
#### {1}  
#### ```  
#### The answer should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated.  
####   
#### The routine should give the same answer if duplicates are present; my initial guess is that duplicates should just be removed at the outset of instantiation. Ordering them will produce canonical processing.

To implement the requested changes, we will likely need to modify the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file. This file contains the `Intersection` class, which is responsible for handling set intersections.

Please add the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To implement the requested changes, we will modify the `Intersection` class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and handle the specific cases as described.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)
=======
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables, and remove duplicates
        args = list(ordered(set(_sympify(args))))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
=======
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq
        if len(self.args) == 2 and all(isinstance(arg, FiniteSet) for arg in self.args):
            common_elements = self.args[0].intersect(self.args[1])
            if len(common_elements) == 1:
                element = list(common_elements)[0]
                return Piecewise((FiniteSet(element), Eq(self.args[1].args[0], element)), (S.EmptySet, True))
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation and handle the specific cases as described.

To address the timeout issue, we need to ensure that the changes are efficient and do not introduce performance bottlenecks. Let's refine the implementation to handle duplicates more efficiently and ensure that the intersection logic is optimized.

Here are the refined changes:

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)
=======
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables, and remove duplicates
        args = list(ordered(set(_sympify(args))))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
=======
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq
        if len(self.args) > 1 and all(isinstance(arg, FiniteSet) for arg in self.args):
            common_elements = self.args[0]
            for arg in self.args[1:]:
                common_elements = common_elements.intersect(arg)
                if not common_elements:
                    return S.EmptySet
            if len(common_elements) == 1:
                element = list(common_elements)[0]
                return Piecewise((FiniteSet(element), Eq(self.args[1].args[0], element)), (S.EmptySet, True))
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should ensure that duplicates are removed efficiently and the intersection logic is optimized to handle the specific cases as described. Please run the tests again to verify the changes.

It seems the first block was already applied or was not necessary. Let's focus on the remaining changes.

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
=======
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq
        if len(self.args) > 1 and all(isinstance(arg, FiniteSet) for arg in self.args):
            common_elements = self.args[0]
            for arg in self.args[1:]:
                common_elements = common_elements.intersect(arg)
                if not common_elements:
                    return S.EmptySet
            if len(common_elements) == 1:
                element = list(common_elements)[0]
                return Piecewise((FiniteSet(element), Eq(self.args[1].args[0], element)), (S.EmptySet, True))
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
