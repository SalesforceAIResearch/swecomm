#### Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot  
#### This is required since every dot is now significant since blueprints can be nested. An error was already added for endpoint names in 1.0, but should have been added for this as well.

To implement this change, we will need to modify the `src/flask/blueprints.py` file to raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot.

Please add the `src/flask/blueprints.py` file to the chat.

To raise an error when a blueprint name contains a dot, we need to modify the `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class in `src/flask/blueprints.py`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

src/flask/blueprints.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.name = name
=======
        if '.' in name:
            raise ValueError("Blueprint name should not contain dots")
        self.name = name
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to src/flask/blueprints.py
