#### SimpleLazyObject doesn't implement __radd__  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Technically, there's a whole bunch of magic methods it doesn't implement, compared to a complete proxy implementation, like that of wrapt.ObjectProxy, but __radd__ being missing is the one that's biting me at the moment.  
#### As far as I can tell, the implementation can't just be  
#### __radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.radd)  
#### because that doesn't exist, which is rubbish.  
#### __radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.attrgetter("__radd__"))  
#### also won't work because types may not have that attr, and attrgetter doesn't supress the exception (correctly)  
#### The minimal implementation I've found that works for me is:  
#### 	def __radd__(self, other):  
#### 		if self._wrapped is empty:  
#### 			self._setup()  
#### 		return other + self._wrapped

To implement the `__radd__` method for `SimpleLazyObject`, we will most likely need to edit the following file:

- `django/utils/functional.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To implement the `__radd__` method for `SimpleLazyObject`, we will add the method to the class definition in `django/utils/functional.py`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/utils/functional.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __copy__(self):
=======
    def __radd__(self, other):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            self._setup()
        return other + self._wrapped

    def __copy__(self):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/utils/functional.py
