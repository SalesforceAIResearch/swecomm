#### Dev Server fails to restart after adding BASE_DIR to TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'] in settings  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Repro steps:  
#### $ pip install -U django  
#### $ django-admin startproject <name>  
#### Open settings.py, copy the BASE_DIR variable from line 16 and paste it into the empty DIRS list on line 57  
#### $ ./manage.py runserver  
#### Back in your IDE, save a file and watch the dev server *NOT* restart.  
#### Back in settings.py, remove BASE_DIR from the templates DIRS list. Manually CTRL-C your dev server (as it won't restart on its own when you save), restart the dev server. Now return to your settings.py file, re-save it, and notice the development server once again detects changes and restarts.  
#### This bug prevents the dev server from restarting no matter where you make changes - it is not just scoped to edits to settings.py.

To address the issue with the development server not restarting after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']`, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `settings.py` - To ensure the `BASE_DIR` is correctly added to the `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` list.
2. `autoreload.py` - To ensure the development server correctly detects changes in the settings and restarts.

Please add the following files to the chat:
1. `settings.py`
2. `django/utils/autoreload.py`

Please add the `settings.py` file from your Django project to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.
