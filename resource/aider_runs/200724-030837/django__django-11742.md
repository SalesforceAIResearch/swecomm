#### Add check to ensure max_length fits longest choice.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### There is currently no check to ensure that Field.max_length is large enough to fit the longest value in Field.choices.  
#### This would be very helpful as often this mistake is not noticed until an attempt is made to save a record with those values that are too long.

To add a check ensuring that `Field.max_length` is large enough to fit the longest value in `Field.choices`, we will likely need to edit the following file:

- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the changes needed to add a check ensuring that `Field.max_length` is large enough to fit the longest value in `Field.choices`:

1. Add a new method `_check_max_length_with_choices` to the `Field` class.
2. Update the `check` method to include the new check.

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        ]
=======
            *self._check_max_length_with_choices(),
        ]

    def _check_max_length_with_choices(self):
        """
        Check if max_length is large enough to fit the longest value in choices.
        """
        if not self.choices or self.max_length is None:
            return []

        max_choice_length = max(len(str(choice)) for choice, _ in self.flatchoices)
        if max_choice_length > self.max_length:
            return [
                checks.Error(
                    f"'max_length' is too small to fit the longest value in 'choices' ({max_choice_length} characters).",
                    obj=self,
                    id='fields.E009',
                )
            ]
        return []
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
