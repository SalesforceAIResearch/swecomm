#### Wrong hint about recursive relationship.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)  
#### 	   
#### When there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:  
#### hint=(  
#### 	'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '  
#### 	'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'  
#### But 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.  
#### This was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.  
#### Edit: fixed description.

To address the issue with the incorrect hint about recursive relationships, the most likely file that needs to be changed is:

- `django/db/models/fields/related.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

Here is the necessary change to correct the hint about recursive relationships in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file:

django/db/models/fields/related.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                            hint=(
                                'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
                                'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'
                            ) % (
                                RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
                                relationship_model_name,
                            ),
=======
                            hint=(
                                'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
                                'use ManyToManyField("%s", through="%s").'
                            ) % (
                                RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,
                                relationship_model_name,
                            ),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
