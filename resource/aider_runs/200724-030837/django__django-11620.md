#### When DEBUG is True, raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method does not result in a technical response  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### This is the response I get (plain text):   
#### A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.  
#### I understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver "this path does not match, try next one" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.  
#### One could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver "this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')".  
#### This would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.

To address the issue where raising `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method does not result in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`, we will likely need to make changes in the URL resolver logic.

The most likely file to need changes is:
- `django/urls/resolvers.py`

Please add `django/urls/resolvers.py` to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To handle the `Http404` exception in the `to_python` method of a path converter and ensure that a technical response is provided when `DEBUG` is `True`, we need to modify the `resolve` method in the `URLResolver` class.

Here are the steps to make the necessary changes:

1. Modify the `resolve` method to catch `Http404` exceptions and re-raise them if `DEBUG` is `True`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/urls/resolvers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                        except ValueError:
                            return None
=======
                        except ValueError:
                            return None
                        except Http404 as e:
                            if settings.DEBUG:
                                raise
                            return None
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that when `DEBUG` is `True`, raising `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method will result in a technical response.

To fix the error, we need to import `Http404` from `django.http`. Here is the updated *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/urls/resolvers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.datastructures import MultiValueDict
=======
from django.utils.datastructures import MultiValueDict
from django.http import Http404
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that `Http404` is defined and can be used in the `except` block.
