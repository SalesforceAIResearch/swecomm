#### Squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings. As far as I'm aware, it's a 4.2 release blocker because you cannot get rid of the index_together deprecation warnings without rewriting migrations, see comment.

To address the deprecation warnings related to `Meta.index_together`, we need to update the migration files that use `index_together` to use `Meta.indexes` instead.

The files most likely to need changes are the migration files in your Django app directories. These files are typically located in the `migrations` subdirectory of each app.

Please add the relevant migration files to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.
