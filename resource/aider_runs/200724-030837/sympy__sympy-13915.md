#### Issue with a substitution that leads to an undefined expression

To address the issue with substitution leading to an undefined expression, we will likely need to make changes in the following files:

1. `sympy/core/expr.py` - This file contains the `Expr` class, which is the base class for all expressions in SymPy. The `subs` method is defined here and will need to be modified to handle cases where the substitution leads to an undefined expression.

2. `sympy/core/basic.py` - This file contains the `Basic` class, which is the base class for all objects in SymPy. The `subs` method is also defined here and may need to be modified to handle cases where the substitution leads to an undefined expression.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To handle the issue where substitution leads to an undefined expression, we need to modify the `subs` method in both `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/core/basic.py` to check for undefined expressions and handle them appropriately.

Here are the changes:

sympy/core/expr.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if kwargs.pop('simultaneous', False):  # XXX should this be the default for dict subs?
            reps = {}
            rv = self
            kwargs['hack2'] = True
            m = Dummy()
            for old, new in sequence:
                d = Dummy(commutative=new.is_commutative)
                # using d*m so Subs will be used on dummy variables
                # in things like Derivative(f(x, y), x) in which x
                # is both free and bound
                rv = rv._subs(old, d*m, **kwargs)
                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                    break
                reps[d] = new
            reps[m] = S.One  # get rid of m
            return rv.xreplace(reps)
        else:
            rv = self
            for old, new in sequence:
                rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                    break
            return rv
=======
        if kwargs.pop('simultaneous', False):  # XXX should this be the default for dict subs?
            reps = {}
            rv = self
            kwargs['hack2'] = True
            m = Dummy()
            for old, new in sequence:
                d = Dummy(commutative=new.is_commutative)
                # using d*m so Subs will be used on dummy variables
                # in things like Derivative(f(x, y), x) in which x
                # is both free and bound
                rv = rv._subs(old, d*m, **kwargs)
                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                    break
                reps[d] = new
            reps[m] = S.One  # get rid of m
            rv = rv.xreplace(reps)
        else:
            rv = self
            for old, new in sequence:
                rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                    break

        # Check for undefined expressions
        if rv.has(S.ComplexInfinity, S.NaN, S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity):
            return S.NaN

        return rv
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/core/basic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return self.func(*args)
=======
        result = self.func(*args)

        # Check for undefined expressions
        if result.has(S.ComplexInfinity, S.NaN, S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity):
            return S.NaN

        return result
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that if the result of a substitution contains any undefined expressions (like `ComplexInfinity`, `NaN`, `Infinity`, or `NegativeInfinity`), the result will be `NaN`. This will handle cases where the substitution leads to an undefined expression.
