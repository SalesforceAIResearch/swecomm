#### autodoc: The annotation only member in superclass is treated as "undocumented"  
#### **Describe the bug**  
#### autodoc: The annotation only member in superclass is treated as "undocumented".  
####   
#### **To Reproduce**  
####   
#### ```  
#### # example.py  
#### class Foo:  
####     """docstring"""  
####     attr1: int  #: docstring  
####   
####   
#### class Bar(Foo):  
####     """docstring"""  
####     attr2: str  #: docstring  
#### ```  
#### ```  
#### # index.rst  
#### .. autoclass:: example.Bar  
####    :members:  
####    :inherited-members:  
#### ```  
####   
#### `Bar.attr1` is not documented. It will be shown if I give `:undoc-members:` option to the autoclass directive call. It seems the attribute is treated as undocumented.  
####   
#### **Expected behavior**  
#### It should be shown.  
####   
#### **Your project**  
#### No  
####   
#### **Screenshots**  
#### No

To address the issue where the annotation-only member in the superclass is treated as "undocumented," we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`: This file contains the main logic for the autodoc extension and is the most likely place where the handling of inherited members is implemented.

Please add `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue where the annotation-only member in the superclass is treated as "undocumented," we need to modify the `filter_members` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to ensure that annotation-only members are not treated as undocumented.

Here are the changes:

1. Update the `filter_members` method to check for annotation-only members in the superclass and treat them as documented.

sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if not isinstance(doc, str):
                # Ignore non-string __doc__
                doc = None

            # if the member __doc__ is the same as self's __doc__, it's just
            # inherited and therefore not the member's doc
            cls = self.get_attr(member, '__class__', None)
            if cls:
                cls_doc = self.get_attr(cls, '__doc__', None)
                if cls_doc == doc:
                    doc = None
=======
            if not isinstance(doc, str):
                # Ignore non-string __doc__
                doc = None

            # Check if the member is an annotation-only member in the superclass
            if not doc:
                for base in inspect.getmro(self.object):
                    if base is not self.object:
                        annotations = get_type_hints(base, None, self.config.autodoc_type_aliases)
                        if membername in annotations:
                            doc = "Annotation-only member in superclass"
                            break

            # if the member __doc__ is the same as self's __doc__, it's just
            # inherited and therefore not the member's doc
            cls = self.get_attr(member, '__class__', None)
            if cls:
                cls_doc = self.get_attr(cls, '__doc__', None)
                if cls_doc == doc:
                    doc = None
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that annotation-only members in the superclass are treated as documented and will be shown in the documentation.

Please review the changes and let me know if you need any further modifications.
