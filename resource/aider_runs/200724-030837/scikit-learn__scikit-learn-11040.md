#### Missing parameter validation in Neighbors estimator for float n_neighbors  
#### ```python  
#### from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors  
#### from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs  
#### X, y = make_blobs()  
#### neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3.)  
#### neighbors.fit(X)  
#### neighbors.kneighbors(X)  
#### ```  
#### ```  
#### ~/checkout/scikit-learn/sklearn/neighbors/binary_tree.pxi in sklearn.neighbors.kd_tree.NeighborsHeap.__init__()  
####   
#### TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer  
#### ```  
#### This should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised (or we could be lenient and cast to integer, but I think a better error might be better).  
####   
#### We need to make sure that   
#### ```python  
#### neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)  
#### ```  
#### also works.

To address the issue of missing parameter validation in the Neighbors estimator for float `n_neighbors`, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `sklearn/neighbors/base.py` - This file likely contains the base class for Neighbors estimators where we can add the validation for `n_neighbors`.
2. `sklearn/neighbors/kde.py` - This file might need changes if it uses `n_neighbors` and requires similar validation.
3. `sklearn/neighbors/lof.py` - This file might need changes if it uses `n_neighbors` and requires similar validation.
4. `sklearn/neighbors/nearest_centroid.py` - This file might need changes if it uses `n_neighbors` and requires similar validation.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

We will add validation for `n_neighbors` to ensure it is an integer in the relevant methods and constructors. Here are the changes:

1. Add validation in the `NeighborsBase` class constructor.
2. Add validation in the `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin`.
3. Add validation in the `fit` method of `LocalOutlierFactor`.

Let's start with the changes:

### 1. `sklearn/neighbors/base.py`

#### Add validation in the `NeighborsBase` class constructor:

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
=======
        if n_neighbors is not None:
            if not isinstance(n_neighbors, int):
                raise ValueError("n_neighbors must be an integer, got {0}".format(type(n_neighbors)))
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### Add validation in the `kneighbors` method of `KNeighborsMixin`:

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if X is not None:
=======
        if n_neighbors is not None:
            if not isinstance(n_neighbors, int):
                raise ValueError("n_neighbors must be an integer, got {0}".format(type(n_neighbors)))

        if X is not None:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 2. `sklearn/neighbors/lof.py`

#### Add validation in the `fit` method of `LocalOutlierFactor`:

sklearn/neighbors/lof.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        super(LocalOutlierFactor, self).fit(X)
=======
        if not isinstance(self.n_neighbors, int):
            raise ValueError("n_neighbors must be an integer, got {0}".format(type(self.n_neighbors)))
        
        super(LocalOutlierFactor, self).fit(X)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 3. `sklearn/neighbors/kde.py`

No changes needed as `KernelDensity` does not use `n_neighbors`.

### 4. `sklearn/neighbors/nearest_centroid.py`

No changes needed as `NearestCentroid` does not use `n_neighbors`.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for the changes:

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
=======
        if n_neighbors is not None:
            if not isinstance(n_neighbors, int):
                raise ValueError("n_neighbors must be an integer, got {0}".format(type(n_neighbors)))
        self.n_neighbors = n_neighbors
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sklearn/neighbors/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if X is not None:
=======
        if n_neighbors is not None:
            if not isinstance(n_neighbors, int):
                raise ValueError("n_neighbors must be an integer, got {0}".format(type(n_neighbors)))

        if X is not None:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sklearn/neighbors/lof.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        super(LocalOutlierFactor, self).fit(X)
=======
        if not isinstance(self.n_neighbors, int):
            raise ValueError("n_neighbors must be an integer, got {0}".format(type(self.n_neighbors)))
        
        super(LocalOutlierFactor, self).fit(X)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
