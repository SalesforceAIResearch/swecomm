#### MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Hi,  
#### We have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following:   
#### class Router(object):  
#### 	def allow_migrate(self, db, model):  
#### 		if db == 'default':  
#### 			return True  
#### 		return False  
#### Current Behaviour  
#### We run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)  
#### When this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied).   
#### The first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish).   
#### ensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table.   
#### I believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.

To address the issue with `MigrationRecorder` not obeying `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods, including `record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, and `ensure_schema`.
2. `django/db/backends/creation.py` - This file contains the `create_test_db` method which is called during the test database setup.
3. `django/test/runner.py` - This file contains the `setup_databases` method which calls the `create_test_db` method.

Please add the following files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes:

1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`
2. `django/db/backends/creation.py`
3. `django/test/runner.py`

To ensure that `MigrationRecorder` obeys the `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we need to modify the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`. We will also need to modify the `setup_databases` method in `django/test/runner.py` to ensure that the migration recording respects the router rules.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify `ensure_schema` to check the router's `allow_migrate` method before creating the schema.
2. Modify `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` to ensure they respect the router's `allow_migrate` method.
3. Modify `setup_databases` in `django/test/runner.py` to ensure it respects the router's `allow_migrate` method.

Let's start with the changes to `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`:

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Make the table
        try:
            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                editor.create_model(self.Migration)
        except DatabaseError as exc:
            raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
=======
        # Check if migration is allowed on this database
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            # Make the table
            try:
                with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                    editor.create_model(self.Migration)
            except DatabaseError as exc:
                raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to modify `setup_databases` in `django/test/runner.py`:

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        old_config = _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
=======
        old_config = _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )

        # Ensure migrations are only applied to allowed databases
        for alias in connections:
            connection = connections[alias]
            if not router.allow_migrate(alias, None):
                connection.settings_dict['MIGRATE'] = False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `MigrationRecorder` and the test database setup respect the `db_router` allow_migrate rules.

Let's correct the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `setup_databases` in `django/test/runner.py`:

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def setup_databases(self, **kwargs):
        return _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
=======
    def setup_databases(self, **kwargs):
        old_config = _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )

        # Ensure migrations are only applied to allowed databases
        for alias in connections:
            connection = connections[alias]
            if not router.allow_migrate(alias, None):
                connection.settings_dict['MIGRATE'] = False

        return old_config

To fix the error, we need to import the `router` module in `django/test/runner.py`. Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.core.management import call_command
=======
from django.core.management import call_command
from django.db import router
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `router` is defined and can be used in the `setup_databases` method.
