#### Allow FilePathField path to accept a callable.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I have a special case where I want to create a model containing the path to some local files on the server/dev machine. Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:  
#### import os  
#### from django.conf import settings  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class LocalFiles(models.Model):  
#### 	name = models.CharField(max_length=255)  
#### 	file = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))  
#### Now when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir  
#### I had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running the migration on production/other machine.

To allow `FilePathField` to accept a callable for the `path` parameter, we will need to modify the `FilePathField` class in the `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` file.

Please add the following file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes:
- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`

Here are the changes needed to allow `FilePathField` to accept a callable for the `path` parameter:

1. Modify the `__init__` method of `FilePathField` to check if `path` is callable and call it if necessary.
2. Update the `deconstruct` method to handle callable paths.

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.path, self.match, self.recursive = path, match, recursive
=======
        self.match, self.recursive = match, recursive
        self.path = path() if callable(path) else path
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.path != '':
            kwargs['path'] = self.path
=======
        if callable(self.path):
            kwargs['path'] = self.path.__name__
        elif self.path != '':
            kwargs['path'] = self.path
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will allow the `FilePathField` to accept a callable for the `path` parameter and handle it appropriately.
