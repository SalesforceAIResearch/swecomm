#### uniq modifies list argument  
#### When you iterate over a dictionary or set and try to modify it while doing so you get an error from Python:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> multiset('THISTLE')  
#### {'T': 2, 'H': 1, 'I': 1, 'S': 1, 'L': 1, 'E': 1}  
#### >>> for i in _:  
#### ...   _.pop(i)  
#### ...  
#### 2  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>  
#### RuntimeError: dictionary changed size during iteration  
#### ```  
#### It would be good to do the same thing from within `uniq` because the output will silently be wrong if you modify a passed list:  
#### ```python  
#### >>> f=list('THISTLE')  
#### >>> for i in uniq(f):  
#### ...   f.remove(i)  
#### ...   i  
#### ...  
#### 'T'  
#### 'I'  
#### 'L'  
#### ```  
#### I think this would entail recording the size at the start and then checking the size and raising a similar RuntimeError if the size changes.

To implement the requested change, we need to modify the `uniq` function. The most likely file to contain the `uniq` function is `sympy/core/compatibility.py`.

Please add `sympy/core/compatibility.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To implement the requested change, we will:

1. Add a check to record the size of the list at the start.
2. Raise a `RuntimeError` if the size changes during iteration.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for the `uniq` function:

sympy/core/compatibility.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def uniq(seq):
    """
    Yield unique items, preserving order.
    """
    seen = set()
    for item in seq:
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            yield item
=======
def uniq(seq):
    """
    Yield unique items, preserving order.
    Raise RuntimeError if the size of the list changes during iteration.
    """
    seen = set()
    initial_size = len(seq)
    for item in seq:
        if len(seq) != initial_size:
            raise RuntimeError("dictionary changed size during iteration")
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            yield item
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's try again with a more precise *SEARCH/REPLACE* block. Here is the updated block for the `uniq` function:

```python

    seen = set()
    for item in seq:
        if item not in seen:
            seen.add(item)
            yield item
=======
def uniq(seq):
    """ Yield unique items, preserving order. Raise RuntimeError if the size of the list changes during iteration. """
    seen = set()
    initial_size = len(seq)
    for item in seq:
        if len(seq) != initial_size:
            raise RuntimeError("dictionary changed size during iteration")
        if item not in seen:
