#### Cannot parse Greek characters (and possibly others) in parse_mathematica  
#### The old Mathematica parser `mathematica` in the package `sympy.parsing.mathematica` was able to parse e.g. Greek characters. Hence the following example works fine:  
#### ```  
#### from sympy.parsing.mathematica import mathematica  
#### mathematica('λ')  
#### Out[]:   
#### λ  
#### ```  
####   
#### As of SymPy v. 1.11, the `mathematica` function is deprecated, and is replaced by `parse_mathematica`. This function, however, seems unable to handle the simple example above:  
#### ```  
#### from sympy.parsing.mathematica import parse_mathematica  
#### parse_mathematica('λ')  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
#### ...  
#### File "<string>", line unknown  
#### SyntaxError: unable to create a single AST for the expression  
#### ```  
####   
#### This appears to be due to a bug in `parse_mathematica`, which is why I have opened this issue.  
####   
#### Thanks in advance!

To address the issue with `parse_mathematica` not being able to handle Greek characters, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` - This file contains the `parse_mathematica` function and is the most likely place where changes will be needed to handle Greek characters correctly.

Please add `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To handle Greek characters and possibly other Unicode characters in `parse_mathematica`, we need to update the regular expressions used in the tokenizer to include Unicode letters. This will ensure that characters like 'λ' are correctly identified and processed.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Update the `_literal` regex pattern to include Unicode letters.
2. Update the `_get_tokenizer` method to use the updated `_literal` pattern.

Let's implement these changes:

sympy/parsing/mathematica.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    _literal = r"[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*"
=======
    _literal = r"[\w][\w0-9]*"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/parsing/mathematica.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if re.match(self._literal, token):
=======
        if re.match(self._literal, token, re.UNICODE):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/parsing/mathematica.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        tokens.extend(map(re.escape, tokens_escape))
=======
        tokens.extend(map(lambda x: re.escape(x), tokens_escape))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will allow the `parse_mathematica` function to correctly handle Greek characters and other Unicode characters.
