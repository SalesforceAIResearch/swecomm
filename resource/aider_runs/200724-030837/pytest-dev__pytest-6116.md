To add a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we will need to modify the argument parsing logic. The most likely file to need changes is:

- `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we will:

1. Modify the `addoption` method to include the new shortcut.
2. Ensure the new shortcut is properly documented and integrated.

Here are the changes:

src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._anonymous.addoption(*opts, **attrs)
=======
        # Adding a shortcut for --collect-only
        if '--collect-only' in opts:
            opts = opts + ('-c',)
        self._anonymous.addoption(*opts, **attrs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will add `-c` as a shortcut for `--collect-only`. If you need further modifications or have any questions, please let me know!
