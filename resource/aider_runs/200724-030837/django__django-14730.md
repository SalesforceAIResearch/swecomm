#### Prevent developers from defining a related_name on symmetrical ManyToManyFields  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### In ManyToManyField, if the symmetrical argument is passed, or if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship, the related field on the target model is not created. However, if a developer passes in the related_name not understanding this fact, they may be confused until they find the information about symmetrical relationship. Thus, it is proposed to raise an error when the user defines a ManyToManyField in this condition.

To implement this change, we will likely need to modify the `ManyToManyField` class in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file. This is where the `ManyToManyField` class is defined and where we can add the logic to raise an error if `related_name` is defined on a symmetrical relationship.

Please add the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To implement the requested change, we need to:

1. Add a check in the `ManyToManyField` class to raise an error if `related_name` is defined on a symmetrical relationship.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/models/fields/related.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if symmetrical is None:
            symmetrical = (to == RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT)
=======
        if symmetrical is None:
            symmetrical = (to == RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT)

        if symmetrical and related_name is not None:
            raise ValueError(
                "Cannot define a related_name on a symmetrical ManyToManyField."
            )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that an error is raised if a developer tries to define a `related_name` on a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`.
