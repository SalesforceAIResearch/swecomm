#### Add `nonform` CSS class for non form errors in FormSets  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Ties Jan Hefting)

#### Forms add the nonfield CSS class for non field errors in ErrorList instances. This is documented in a section on â€‹rendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.

To add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/forms/formsets.py` - This file will need changes to add the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors.
2. `django/forms/utils.py` - This file might need changes to handle the new `nonform` CSS class in the `ErrorList` class.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, we will make the following changes:

1. Modify `django/forms/formsets.py` to add the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors.
2. Modify `django/forms/utils.py` to handle the new `nonform` CSS class in the `ErrorList` class.

Here are the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/forms/formsets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._non_form_errors = self.error_class()
=======
        self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(error_class='nonform')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/forms/utils.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            self.error_class = 'errorlist'
=======
            self.error_class = error_class or 'errorlist'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `nonform` CSS class is added to non-form errors in FormSets, allowing for better distinction when rendering error messages.
