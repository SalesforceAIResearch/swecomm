#### Possible bug in io.fits related to D exponents  
#### I came across the following code in ``fitsrec.py``:  
####   
#### ```python  
####         # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers  
####         if 'D' in format:  
####             output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))  
#### ```  
####   
#### I think this may be incorrect because as far as I can tell ``replace`` is not an in-place operation for ``chararray`` (it returns a copy). Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.

To address the possible bug in `io.fits` related to D exponents, we will need to edit the `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` file.

Please add `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the possible bug related to the D exponents, we will modify the `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` file to ensure that the `replace` operation is applied correctly. We will also add a test to ensure this functionality is covered.

Here are the changes:

1. Fix the `replace` operation to ensure it is applied correctly.
2. Add a test to cover this functionality.

First, let's fix the `replace` operation in `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py`:

astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
=======
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field = np.char.replace(output_field, encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to add a test to ensure this functionality is covered. Please add the following test file:

astropy/io/fits/tests/test_fitsrec.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
import numpy as np
from astropy.io.fits.fitsrec import FITS_rec, _get_recarray_field
from astropy.io.fits.column import ColDefs, Column

def test_exponent_replacement():
    # Create a dummy FITS_rec object with a column that has 'D' format
    col = Column(name='col1', format='D20.10', array=np.array([1.23e10, 4.56e-10]))
    cols = ColDefs([col])
    fits_rec = FITS_rec.from_columns(cols, nrows=2)

    # Scale back to trigger the replacement
    fits_rec._scale_back()

    # Check if the exponent separator has been replaced correctly
    output_field = _get_recarray_field(fits_rec, 'col1')
    assert b'D' in output_field.tobytes()
    assert b'E' not in output_field.tobytes()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `replace` operation is applied correctly and that the functionality is covered by a test.
