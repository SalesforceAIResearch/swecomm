#### Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Let's consider the following operations:   
#### operations = [  
#### 	migrations.AddField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),  
#### 	),  
#### ]  
#### If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:  
#### optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books")   
#### [<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]  
#### Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField.   
#### Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented?   
#### Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like  
#### 		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(  
#### 			operation  
#### 		):  
#### 			return [operation]

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we will likely need to modify the file responsible for the migration optimization logic. The most probable file to need changes is:

- `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we need to modify the `optimize_inner` method in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. Specifically, we will add logic to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
=======
                elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.model_name == other.model_name and operation.name == other.name):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field are reduced properly.

To fix the error, we need to import `AlterField` at the beginning of the file. Here are the necessary changes:

1. Import `AlterField` from `django.db.migrations.operations.fields`.
2. Modify the `optimize_inner` method to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class MigrationOptimizer:
=======
from django.db.migrations.operations.fields import AlterField

class MigrationOptimizer:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
=======
                elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.model_name == other.model_name and operation.name == other.name):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's ensure the `SEARCH` block exactly matches the existing code. Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
                    # Can't perform a right reduction.
                    right = False
=======
                elif not result and not (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.model_name == other.model_name and operation.name == other.name):
                    # Can't perform a right reduction.
                    right = False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

It seems the replacement lines are already present in the file. Therefore, no further changes are needed for that part.

The import statement was successfully added, so the code should now work as intended. If you encounter any further issues or need additional changes, please let me know!
