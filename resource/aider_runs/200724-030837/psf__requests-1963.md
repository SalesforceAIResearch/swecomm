#### `Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection  
#### Consider the following redirection chain:  
####   
#### ```  
#### POST /do_something HTTP/1.1  
#### Host: server.example.com  
#### ...  
####   
#### HTTP/1.1 303 See Other  
#### Location: /new_thing_1513  
####   
#### GET /new_thing_1513  
#### Host: server.example.com  
#### ...  
####   
#### HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect  
#### Location: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513  
#### ```  
####   
#### The intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to  
#### a GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because  
#### `Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_  
#### request object, Requests will issue a POST!

To address the issue with `Session.resolve_redirects` copying the original request for all subsequent requests, we will need to modify the `requests/sessions.py` file.

Please add `requests/sessions.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with `Session.resolve_redirects` copying the original request for all subsequent requests, we need to modify the method to copy the last request instead of the original one. Here are the necessary changes:

requests/sessions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        while resp.is_redirect:
            prepared_request = req.copy()
=======
        while resp.is_redirect:
            prepared_request = resp.request.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that each subsequent request in the redirection chain is based on the last request, preserving any modifications made by intermediate redirects.

> Applied edit to requests/sessions.py
