#### Inherited model doesn't correctly order by "-pk" when specified on Parent.Meta.ordering  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Given the following model definition:  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class Parent(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		ordering = ["-pk"]  
#### class Child(Parent):  
#### 	pass  
#### Querying the Child class results in the following:  
#### >>> print(Child.objects.all().query)  
#### SELECT "myapp_parent"."id", "myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" FROM "myapp_child" INNER JOIN "myapp_parent" ON ("myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" = "myapp_parent"."id") ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" ASC  
#### The query is ordered ASC but I expect the order to be DESC.

To address the issue with the inherited model not correctly ordering by `-pk` when specified in `Parent.Meta.ordering`, we will likely need to make changes to the Django ORM, specifically in the model and query handling code.

The files most likely to need changes are:

1. `django/db/models/query.py` - This file handles the construction of queries and might need adjustments to respect the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class.
2. `django/db/models/options.py` - This file manages the options for models, including ordering. It might need changes to ensure that the ordering is correctly inherited by child models.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the inherited model not correctly ordering by `-pk` when specified in `Parent.Meta.ordering`, we need to ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly inherited by child models.

We'll make the following changes:

1. Modify `django/db/models/options.py` to ensure that the ordering from the parent model is correctly inherited by the child model.
2. Ensure that the query respects this ordering in `django/db/models/query.py`.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Modify `django/db/models/options.py`

Ensure that the ordering from the parent model is correctly inherited by the child model.

django/db/models/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ordering = []
=======
        self.ordering = getattr(meta, 'ordering', [])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Modify `django/db/models/query.py`

Ensure that the query respects the inherited ordering.

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.query.extra_order_by or self.query.order_by:
            return True
        elif self.query.default_ordering and self.query.get_meta().ordering:
            return True
        else:
            return False
=======
        if self.query.extra_order_by or self.query.order_by:
            return True
        if self.query.default_ordering:
            ordering = self.query.get_meta().ordering
            if ordering:
                return True
            # Check for inherited ordering
            for parent in self.model._meta.get_parent_list():
                if parent._meta.ordering:
                    return True
        return False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly inherited and respected by the child model.
