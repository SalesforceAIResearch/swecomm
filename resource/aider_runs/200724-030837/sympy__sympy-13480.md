To address the issue with `coth(log(tan(x))).subs(x, 2)` causing a `NameError` due to an undefined variable `cotm`, we need to edit the file `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`.

Please add the file `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To fix the `NameError` in the `coth` function, we need to replace the undefined variable `cotm` with the correct variable `cothm`. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to make this change:

sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity:
=======
                    if cothm is S.ComplexInfinity:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the correct variable is used, preventing the `NameError` from occurring.
