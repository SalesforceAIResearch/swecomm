#### legend draggable as keyword  
#### <!--To help us understand and resolve your issue, please fill out the form to the best of your ability.-->  
#### <!--You can feel free to delete the sections that do not apply.-->

#### ### Feature request  
####   
#### **There is not keyword to make legend draggable at creation**  
####   
#### <!--A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug-->  
####   
#### Is there a code reason why one can not add a "draggable=True" keyword to the __init__ function for Legend?  This would be more handy than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason why it would not work?

To add a "draggable" keyword to the `__init__` function for `Legend`, the most likely file that will need changes is:

- `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add a "draggable" keyword to the `__init__` function for `Legend`, we need to:

1. Add the `draggable` parameter to the `__init__` method.
2. Set the draggable state based on the `draggable` parameter.

Here are the necessary changes:

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        *,
=======
        draggable=False,
        *,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.set_title(title, prop=title_prop_fp)
=======
        self.set_title(title, prop=title_prop_fp)
        self.set_draggable(draggable)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will allow the `Legend` class to accept a `draggable` keyword argument and set the draggable state accordingly.
