#### Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Error message:  
#### table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.  
#### We have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.  
#### We have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.   
#### Is this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.

To address the issue of Django throwing an error when different apps with different models have the same table name, we will need to modify the Django model validation logic. The most likely file to need changes is:

- `django/db/models/base.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue, we need to modify the `_check_model_name_db_lookup_clashes` method in `django/db/models/base.py` to allow different apps to have models with the same table name. 

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `_check_model_name_db_lookup_clashes` method to skip the check for table name clashes across different apps.

django/db/models/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @classmethod
    def _check_model_name_db_lookup_clashes(cls):
        errors = []
        model_name = cls.__name__
        if model_name.startswith('_') or model_name.endswith('_'):
            errors.append(
                checks.Error(
                    "The model name '%s' cannot start or end with an underscore "
                    "as it collides with the query lookup syntax." % model_name,
                    obj=cls,
                    id='models.E023'
                )
            )
        elif LOOKUP_SEP in model_name:
            errors.append(
                checks.Error(
                    "The model name '%s' cannot contain double underscores as "
                    "it collides with the query lookup syntax." % model_name,
                    obj=cls,
                    id='models.E024'
                )
            )
        return errors

            if len(models) > 1:
                errors.append(

                            cls._meta.db_table,
                            ', '.join(model.__name__ for model in models)

                    )
                )
        return errors
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will allow different apps to have models with the same table name without throwing an error.
