#### Remove "for = ..." from MultiWidget's <label>.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### The instance from Raw MultiWidget class generate id_for_label like f'{id_}0'  
#### It has not sense.  
#### For example ChoiceWidget has self.add_id_index and I can decide it myself, how I will see label_id - with or without index.  
#### I think, it is better to remove completely id_for_label method from MultiWidget Class.
