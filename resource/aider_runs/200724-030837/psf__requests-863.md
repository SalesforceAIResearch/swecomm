#### Allow lists in the dict values of the hooks argument  
#### Currently the Request class has a .register_hook() method but it parses the dictionary it expects from it's hooks argument weirdly: the argument can only specify one hook function per hook.  If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().  
####   
#### This would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.

To implement the requested change, we will need to modify the `requests/models.py` file. Specifically, we will need to update the `Request.__init__` method to handle lists in the `hooks` argument properly.

Please add the `requests/models.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Here are the necessary changes to `requests/models.py` to allow lists in the dictionary values of the `hooks` argument:

1. Update the `Request.__init__` method to handle lists in the `hooks` argument properly.

requests/models.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        for (k, v) in list(hooks.items()):
            self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)
=======
        for (k, v) in hooks.items():
            if isinstance(v, list):
                for hook in v:
                    self.register_hook(event=k, hook=hook)
            else:
                self.register_hook(event=k, hook=v)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if the value in the `hooks` dictionary is a list, each item in the list is registered as a hook. If the value is not a list, it is registered as a single hook.
