#### Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Charlie DeTar)  
#### 	   
#### Given a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:  
#### class Product(models.Model):  
#### 	sku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)  
#### class Order(models.Model):  
#### 	product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  
#### If the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not "see" the primary key's change:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product()  
#### 	order.product.sku = "foo"  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product_id="").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails  
#### Instead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku="" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.  
#### On the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product(sku="foo")  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds  
#### Committing the transaction also succeeds.  
#### This may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.

To address the issue described, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`: This file handles the logic for setting related objects on models, which is where the issue with the primary key not being updated correctly is likely occurring.
2. `django/db/models/fields/related.py`: This file defines the ForeignKey field and may need adjustments to ensure the primary key is correctly set when the related object is saved.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue, we need to ensure that the primary key of the related object is correctly set before saving the parent object. This involves modifying the `__set__` method in the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` class in `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` to ensure the primary key is updated.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify `__set__` in `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` to ensure the primary key is set correctly.

django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Set the values of the related field.
        else:
            for lh_field, rh_field in self.field.related_fields:
                setattr(instance, lh_field.attname, getattr(value, rh_field.attname))
=======
        # Set the values of the related field.
        else:
            for lh_field, rh_field in self.field.related_fields:
                setattr(instance, lh_field.attname, getattr(value, rh_field.attname))
            # Ensure the primary key is set correctly if it's not already set
            if value._state.adding and value._meta.pk.attname in instance.__dict__:
                value.save()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

2. Modify `__set__` in `ReverseOneToOneDescriptor` to ensure the primary key is set correctly.

django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        elif not isinstance(value, self.related.related_model):
            # An object must be an instance of the related class.
            raise ValueError(
                'Cannot assign "%r": "%s.%s" must be a "%s" instance.' % (

                    self.related.get_accessor_name(),
                    self.related.related_model._meta.object_name,
                )
            )
        else:
            if instance._state.db is None:
                instance._state.db = router.db_for_write(instance.__class__, instance=value)

                value._state.db = router.db_for_write(value.__class__, instance=instance)
            if not router.allow_relation(value, instance):
                raise ValueError('Cannot assign "%r": the current database router prevents this relation.' % value)

            related_pk = tuple(getattr(instance, field.attname) for field in self.related.field.foreign_related_fields)
            # Set the value of the related field to the value of the related object's related field
            for index, field in enumerate(self.related.field.local_related_fields):
                setattr(value, field.attname, related_pk[index])

            # Set the related instance cache used by __get__ to avoid an SQL query
            # when accessing the attribute we just set.
            self.related.set_cached_value(instance, value)

            # Set the forward accessor cache on the related object to the current
            # instance to avoid an extra SQL query if it's accessed later on.
            self.related.field.set_cached_value(value, instance)

        elif not isinstance(value, self.related.related_model):

            raise ValueError(
                'Cannot assign "%r": "%s.%s" must be a "%s" instance.' % (

                    self.related.get_accessor_name(),
                    self.related.related_model._meta.object_name,
                )
            )
        else:
            if instance._state.db is None:
                instance._state.db = router.db_for_write(instance.__class__, instance=value)
            if value._state.db is None:
                value._state.db = router.db_for_write(value.__class__, instance=instance)
            if not router.allow_relation(value, instance):
                raise ValueError('Cannot assign "%r": the current database router prevents this relation.' % value)

            related_pk = tuple(getattr(instance, field.attname) for field in self.related.field.foreign_related_fields)
            # Set the value of the related field to the value of the related object's related field
            for index, field in enumerate(self.related.field.local_related_fields):
                setattr(value, field.attname, related_pk[index])

            # Ensure the primary key is set correctly if it's not already set
            if value._state.adding and value._meta.pk.attname in instance.__dict__:
                value.save()

            # Set the related instance cache used by __get__ to avoid an SQL query
            # when accessing the attribute we just set.
            self.related.set_cached_value(instance, value)

            # Set the forward accessor cache on the related object to the current
            # instance to avoid an extra SQL query if it's accessed later on.
            self.related.field.set_cached_value(value, instance)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the primary key of the related object is correctly set before saving the parent object, preventing data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys.
