#### Wrong Derivative kind attribute  
#### I'm playing around with the `kind` attribute.  
####   
#### The following is correct:  
####   
#### ```  
#### from sympy import Integral, Derivative  
#### from sympy import MatrixSymbol  
#### from sympy.abc import x  
#### A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2)  
#### i = Integral(A, x)  
#### i.kind  
#### # MatrixKind(NumberKind)  
#### ```  
####   
#### This one is wrong:  
#### ```  
#### d = Derivative(A, x)  
#### d.kind  
#### # UndefinedKind  
#### ```

To address the issue with the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` class, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `sympy/core/function.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the `kind` attribute for the `Derivative` class, we need to update the `Derivative` class in `sympy/core/function.py` to correctly determine the kind based on its expression and variables.

Here are the changes:

sympy/core/function.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    @property
    def _diff_wrt(self):
        """An expression may be differentiated wrt a Derivative if
        it is in elementary form.
=======
    @property
    def kind(self):
        from sympy.core.kind import MKind
        return MKind(self.expr.kind, self.variables[0].kind)

    @property
    def _diff_wrt(self):
        """An expression may be differentiated wrt a Derivative if
        it is in elementary form.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change adds a `kind` property to the `Derivative` class that correctly determines the kind based on its expression and variables.
