#### urllib3 exceptions passing through requests API  
#### I don't know if it's a design goal of requests to hide urllib3's exceptions and wrap them around requests.exceptions types.  
####   
#### (If it's not IMHO it should be, but that's another discussion)  
####   
#### If it is, I have at least two of them passing through that I have to catch in addition to requests' exceptions. They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)  
####   
#### Thanks!

To address the issue of urllib3 exceptions passing through the requests API, we will need to modify the following files:

1. `requests/exceptions.py` - To add new exception classes that wrap around `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`.
2. `requests/adapters.py` - To catch the `urllib3` exceptions and raise the corresponding `requests` exceptions.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to handle `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` by wrapping them in `requests` exceptions.

First, we will add new exception classes in `requests/exceptions.py`.

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
```
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
=======
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import DecodeError as BaseDecodeError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError as BaseTimeoutError
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class StreamConsumedError(RequestException, TypeError):
    """The content for this response was already consumed"""


class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""
=======
class StreamConsumedError(RequestException, TypeError):
    """The content for this response was already consumed"""


class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""


class DecodeError(RequestException, BaseDecodeError):
    """Failed to decode response content"""


class TimeoutError(RequestException, BaseTimeoutError):
    """The request timed out."""
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we will modify `requests/adapters.py` to catch these exceptions and raise the corresponding `requests` exceptions.

requests/adapters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ResponseError
=======
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ResponseError, DecodeError as _DecodeError, TimeoutError as _TimeoutError
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/adapters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        except (_SSLError, _HTTPError) as e:
=======
        except (_SSLError, _HTTPError, _DecodeError, _TimeoutError) as e:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/adapters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            else:
=======
            elif isinstance(e, _DecodeError):
                raise DecodeError(e, request=request)
            elif isinstance(e, _TimeoutError):
                raise TimeoutError(e, request=request)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` are properly wrapped in `requests` exceptions.

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `requests/exceptions.py`:

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
=======
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import DecodeError as BaseDecodeError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError as BaseTimeoutError
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
