#### Intersection should remove duplicates  
#### ```python  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{1},{x})  
#### EmptySet()  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{x})  
#### {1}  
#### ```  
#### The answer should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated.  
####   
#### The routine should give the same answer if duplicates are present; my initial guess is that duplicates should just be removed at the outset of instantiation. Ordering them will produce canonical processing.

To implement the requested changes, we will likely need to modify the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file. This file should contain the implementation of the `Intersection` class where we can add logic to remove duplicates and handle the canonical processing.

Please add the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To implement the requested changes, we need to modify the `Intersection` class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` to remove duplicates and handle canonical processing. Here are the steps:

1. Modify the `__new__` method of the `Intersection` class to remove duplicates.
2. Ensure that the `Intersection` class handles the canonical processing correctly.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))
=======
        # Remove duplicates and order the arguments
        args = list(ordered(set(args), Set._infimum_key))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        obj = Basic.__new__(cls, *args)
=======
        # Handle the case where duplicates are present
        if len(args) == 1:
            return args[0]
        obj = Basic.__new__(cls, *args)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
=======
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq
        if len(self.args) == 2 and isinstance(self.args[0], FiniteSet) and isinstance(self.args[1], FiniteSet):
            common_elements = self.args[0].intersect(self.args[1])
            if len(common_elements) == 1:
                element = list(common_elements)[0]
                return Piecewise((common_elements, Eq(self.args[1].args[0], element)), (S.EmptySet, True))
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation and that the `Intersection` class handles the canonical processing correctly.
