#### SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() cannot properly detect that exponent is dimensionless  
#### How to reproduce:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### from sympy import exp  
#### from sympy.physics import units  
#### from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI  
####   
#### expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)  
#### dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]  
####   
#### assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)  
####   
#### buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)  
#### SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)  
####   
#### # results in ValueError: Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)  
#### ```

To address the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` not properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` not properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless, we need to modify the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in `sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py`. We will add a check to ensure that the dimension of the exponent is correctly identified as dimensionless.

Here are the changes:

sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from sympy.physics.units import DimensionSystem, Dimension, dHg0
=======
from sympy.physics.units import DimensionSystem, Dimension, dHg0, Dimensionless
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return factor, dim
=======
        if dim == Dimensionless:
            return factor, Dimension(1)
        return factor, dim
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if the dimension is identified as `Dimensionless`, it will be correctly returned as `Dimension(1)`, which represents a dimensionless quantity.

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return factor, dim
=======
        if dim == Dimensionless:
            return factor, Dimension(1)
        return factor, dim
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's ensure we have the correct context for the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method. Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block with more context:

sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        factor, dim = DimensionSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension(self, expr)
        return factor, dim
=======
        factor, dim = DimensionSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension(self, expr)
        if dim == Dimensionless:
            return factor, Dimension(1)
        return factor, dim
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
