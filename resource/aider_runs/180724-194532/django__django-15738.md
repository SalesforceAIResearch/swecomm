#### Models migration with change field foreign to many and deleting unique together.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Simon Charette)  
#### 	   
#### I have models like  
#### class Authors(models.Model):  
#### 	project_data_set = models.ForeignKey(  
#### 		ProjectDataSet,  
#### 		on_delete=models.PROTECT  
#### 	)  
#### 	state = models.IntegerField()  
#### 	start_date = models.DateField()  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		 unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)  
#### and  
#### class DataSet(models.Model):  
#### 	name = models.TextField(max_length=50)  
#### class Project(models.Model):  
#### 	data_sets = models.ManyToManyField(  
#### 		DataSet,  
#### 		through='ProjectDataSet',  
#### 	)  
#### 	name = models.TextField(max_length=50)  
#### class ProjectDataSet(models.Model):  
#### 	"""  
#### 	Cross table of data set and project  
#### 	"""  
#### 	data_set = models.ForeignKey(DataSet, on_delete=models.PROTECT)  
#### 	project = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.PROTECT)  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		unique_together = (('data_set', 'project'),)  
#### when i want to change field project_data_set in Authors model from foreign key field to many to many field I must delete a unique_together, cause it can't be on many to many field.  
#### Then my model should be like:  
#### class Authors(models.Model):  
#### 	project_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(  
#### 		ProjectDataSet,  
#### 	)  
#### 	state = models.IntegerField()  
#### 	start_date = models.DateField()  
#### But when I want to do a migrations.  
#### python3 manage.py makemigrations  
#### python3 manage.py migrate  
#### I have error:  
#### ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)  
#### The database is on production, so I can't delete previous initial migrations, and this error isn't depending on database, cause I delete it and error is still the same.  
#### My solve is to first delete unique_together, then do a makemigrations and then migrate. After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.  
#### But in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.  
#### I added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.

To achieve the migration you described, we need to:

1. Remove the `unique_together` constraint from the `Authors` model.
2. Create a migration for this change.
3. Change the `project_data_set` field in the `Authors` model from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField`.
4. Create another migration for this change.

The files that are most likely to need changes are:

1. `models.py` where the `Authors` model is defined.
2. The migration files that will be generated.

Please add the `models.py` file to the chat so we can proceed with the changes.
