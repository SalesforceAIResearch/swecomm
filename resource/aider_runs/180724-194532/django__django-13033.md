#### Self referencing foreign key doesn't correctly order by a relation "_id" field.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Initially discovered on 2.2.10 but verified still happens on 3.0.6. Given the following models:  
#### class OneModel(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		ordering = ("-id",)  
#### 	id = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)  
#### 	root = models.ForeignKey("OneModel", on_delete=models.CASCADE, null=True)  
#### 	oneval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)  
#### class TwoModel(models.Model):  
#### 	id = models.BigAutoField(primary_key=True)  
#### 	record = models.ForeignKey(OneModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  
#### 	twoval = models.BigIntegerField(null=True)  
#### The following queryset gives unexpected results and appears to be an incorrect SQL query:  
#### qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])  
#### qs = qs.order_by("record__root_id")  
#### print(qs.query)  
#### SELECT "orion_twomodel"."id", "orion_twomodel"."record_id", "orion_twomodel"."twoval" FROM "orion_twomodel" INNER JOIN "orion_onemodel" ON ("orion_twomodel"."record_id" = "orion_onemodel"."id") LEFT OUTER JOIN "orion_onemodel" T3 ON ("orion_onemodel"."root_id" = T3."id") WHERE "orion_onemodel"."oneval" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3."id" DESC  
#### The query has an unexpected DESCENDING sort. That appears to come from the default sort order on the OneModel class, but I would expect the order_by() to take prececence. The the query has two JOINS, which is unnecessary. It appears that, since OneModel.root is a foreign key to itself, that is causing it to do the unnecessary extra join. In fact, testing a model where root is a foreign key to a third model doesn't show the problem behavior.  
#### Note also that the queryset with order_by("record__root") gives the exact same SQL.  
#### This queryset gives correct results and what looks like a pretty optimal SQL:  
#### qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])  
#### qs = qs.order_by("record__root__id")  
#### print(qs.query)  
#### SELECT "orion_twomodel"."id", "orion_twomodel"."record_id", "orion_twomodel"."twoval" FROM "orion_twomodel" INNER JOIN "orion_onemodel" ON ("orion_twomodel"."record_id" = "orion_onemodel"."id") WHERE "orion_onemodel"."oneval" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY "orion_onemodel"."root_id" ASC  
#### So is this a potential bug or a misunderstanding on my part?  
#### Another queryset that works around the issue and gives a reasonable SQL query and expected results:  
#### qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])  
#### qs = qs.annotate(root_id=F("record__root_id"))  
#### qs = qs.order_by("root_id")  
#### print(qs.query)  
#### SELECT "orion_twomodel"."id", "orion_twomodel"."record_id", "orion_twomodel"."twoval" FROM "orion_twomodel" INNER JOIN "orion_onemodel" ON ("orion_twomodel"."record_id" = "orion_onemodel"."id") WHERE "orion_onemodel"."oneval" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY "orion_onemodel"."zero_id" ASC  
#### ASCENDING sort, and a single INNER JOIN, as I'd expect. That actually works for my use because I need that output column anyway.  
#### One final oddity; with the original queryset but the inverted sort order_by():  
#### qs = TwoModel.objects.filter(record__oneval__in=[1,2,3])  
#### qs = qs.order_by("-record__root_id")  
#### print(qs.query)  
#### SELECT "orion_twomodel"."id", "orion_twomodel"."record_id", "orion_twomodel"."twoval" FROM "orion_twomodel" INNER JOIN "orion_onemodel" ON ("orion_twomodel"."record_id" = "orion_onemodel"."id") LEFT OUTER JOIN "orion_onemodel" T3 ON ("orion_onemodel"."root_id" = T3."id") WHERE "orion_onemodel"."oneval" IN (1, 2, 3) ORDER BY T3."id" ASC  
#### One gets the query with the two JOINs but an ASCENDING sort order. I was not under the impression that sort orders are somehow relative to the class level sort order, eg: does specifing order_by("-record__root_id") invert the class sort order? Testing that on a simple case doesn't show that behavior at all.  
#### Thanks for any assistance and clarification.

To address the issue with the self-referencing foreign key and the incorrect ordering in the SQL query, we will likely need to make changes in the Django ORM query generation logic. The most relevant files for this are:

1. `django/db/models/sql/query.py`
2. `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`

Please add these files to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the self-referencing foreign key and the incorrect ordering in the SQL query, we need to make changes in the Django ORM query generation logic. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `order_by` clause correctly handles self-referencing foreign keys without introducing unnecessary joins or incorrect sort orders.

Here are the changes we need to make:

1. Modify the `get_order_by` method in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` to handle self-referencing foreign keys correctly.
2. Ensure that the `get_order_by` method does not introduce unnecessary joins and respects the specified `order_by` clause.

Let's start with the changes in `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`.

            if col in self.query.annotation_select:
                # Reference to expression in SELECT clause
                order_by.append((
                    OrderBy(Ref(col, self.query.annotation_select[col]), descending=descending),
                    True))
                continue
            if col in self.query.annotations:
                # References to an expression which is masked out of the SELECT
                # clause.
                expr = self.query.annotations[col]
                if isinstance(expr, Value):
                    # output_field must be resolved for constants.
                    expr = Cast(expr, expr.output_field)
                order_by.append((OrderBy(expr, descending=descending), False))
                continue
=======
            if col in self.query.annotation_select:
                # Reference to expression in SELECT clause
                order_by.append((
                    OrderBy(Ref(col, self.query.annotation_select[col]), descending=descending),
                    True))
                continue
            if col in self.query.annotations:
                # References to an expression which is masked out of the SELECT
                # clause.
                expr = self.query.annotations[col]
                if isinstance(expr, Value):
                    # output_field must be resolved for constants.
                    expr = Cast(expr, expr.output_field)
                order_by.append((OrderBy(expr, descending=descending), False))
                continue
            if col.endswith('_id') and '__' in field:
                # Handle self-referencing foreign key ordering
                related_field = field.split('__')[-1]
                if related_field == 'id':
                    order_by.append((
                        OrderBy(F(col), descending=descending),
                        False))
                    continue
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to ensure that the `get_order_by` method does not introduce unnecessary joins and respects the specified `order_by` clause. This involves modifying the logic to avoid redundant joins for self-referencing foreign keys.
