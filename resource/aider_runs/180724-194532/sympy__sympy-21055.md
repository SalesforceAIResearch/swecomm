#### `refine()` does not understand how to simplify complex arguments  
#### Just learned about the refine-function, which would come in handy frequently for me.  But  
#### `refine()` does not recognize that argument functions simplify for real numbers.  
####   
#### ```  
#### >>> from sympy import *                                                       
#### >>> var('a,x')                                                                
#### >>> J = Integral(sin(x)*exp(-a*x),(x,0,oo))                                       
#### >>> J.doit()  
#### 	Piecewise((1/(a**2 + 1), 2*Abs(arg(a)) < pi), (Integral(exp(-a*x)*sin(x), (x, 0, oo)), True))  
#### >>> refine(J.doit(),Q.positive(a))                                                   
####         Piecewise((1/(a**2 + 1), 2*Abs(arg(a)) < pi), (Integral(exp(-a*x)*sin(x), (x, 0, oo)), True))  
#### >>> refine(abs(a),Q.positive(a))                                              
#### 	a  
#### >>> refine(arg(a),Q.positive(a))                                              
#### 	arg(a)  
#### ```  
#### I cann't find any open issues identifying this.  Easy to fix, though.

To address the issue with `refine()` not simplifying complex arguments, we will likely need to make changes to the `refine` function and possibly the assumptions handling in SymPy. The most likely files to need changes are:

1. `sympy/assumptions/assume.py` - This file contains the assumptions handling logic.
2. `sympy/simplify/refine.py` - This file contains the `refine` function implementation.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `refine()` not simplifying complex arguments, we need to make changes to the `refine` function. The `refine` function is located in `sympy/simplify/refine.py`.

Please add the file `sympy/simplify/refine.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.
