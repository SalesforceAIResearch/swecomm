#### Dev Server fails to restart after adding BASE_DIR to TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'] in settings  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Repro steps:  
#### $ pip install -U django  
#### $ django-admin startproject <name>  
#### Open settings.py, copy the BASE_DIR variable from line 16 and paste it into the empty DIRS list on line 57  
#### $ ./manage.py runserver  
#### Back in your IDE, save a file and watch the dev server *NOT* restart.  
#### Back in settings.py, remove BASE_DIR from the templates DIRS list. Manually CTRL-C your dev server (as it won't restart on its own when you save), restart the dev server. Now return to your settings.py file, re-save it, and notice the development server once again detects changes and restarts.  
#### This bug prevents the dev server from restarting no matter where you make changes - it is not just scoped to edits to settings.py.

To address the issue with the development server not restarting after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in `settings.py`, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/utils/autoreload.py` - This file handles the auto-reloading mechanism for the development server.

Please add `django/utils/autoreload.py` to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the development server not restarting after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in `settings.py`, we need to ensure that the autoreloader correctly watches the directories specified in the `TEMPLATES` setting.

We will modify `django/utils/autoreload.py` to include the directories specified in `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in the list of watched files.

Here are the changes:

django/utils/autoreload.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.functional import cached_property
=======
from django.conf import settings
from django.utils.functional import cached_property
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/utils/autoreload.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        yield from self.extra_files
=======
        yield from self.extra_files
        # Include directories specified in TEMPLATES setting
        for template_dir in settings.TEMPLATES[0].get('DIRS', []):
            yield Path(template_dir).resolve()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the directories specified in `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` are included in the list of watched files, allowing the development server to restart when changes are made to files in those directories.
