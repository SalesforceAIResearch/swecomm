#### Comparing string to array in _estimate_mi  
#### In ``_estimate_mi`` there is ``discrete_features == 'auto'`` but discrete features can be an array of indices or a boolean mask.  
#### This will error in future versions of numpy.  
#### Also this means we never test this function with discrete features != 'auto', it seems?

To address the issue with comparing `discrete_features` to `'auto'` in `_estimate_mi`, we need to modify the relevant file where `_estimate_mi` is defined. The most likely file to need changes is:

- `sklearn/feature_selection/_mutual_info.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.
