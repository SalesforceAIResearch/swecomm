#### Intersection should remove duplicates  
#### ```python  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{1},{x})  
#### EmptySet()  
#### >>> Intersection({1},{x})  
#### {1}  
#### ```  
#### The answer should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated.  
####   
#### The routine should give the same answer if duplicates are present; my initial guess is that duplicates should just be removed at the outset of instantiation. Ordering them will produce canonical processing.

To implement the requested changes, we will likely need to modify the `sympy/sets/sets.py` file. This file contains the `Intersection` class, which is responsible for handling set intersections.

Please add `sympy/sets/sets.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To implement the requested changes, we will modify the `Intersection` class in `sympy/sets/sets.py` to remove duplicates at the outset of instantiation and handle the specific cases mentioned.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Modify the `__new__` method of the `Intersection` class to remove duplicates.
2. Add logic to handle the specific cases where duplicates are present.

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)

        # Reduce sets using known rules
        if evaluate:
            args = list(cls._new_args_filter(args))
            return simplify_intersection(args)

        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))
=======
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)

        # Remove duplicates
        args = list(ordered(set(args), Set._infimum_key))

        # Reduce sets using known rules
        if evaluate:
            args = list(cls._new_args_filter(args))
            return simplify_intersection(args)

        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
=======
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq

        conditions = [set.contains(other) for set in self.args]
        if len(conditions) != len(set(conditions)):
            return Piecewise((self.args[0], Eq(self.args[0], other)), (S.EmptySet, True))
        return And(*conditions)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that duplicates are removed at the outset of instantiation and handle the specific cases where duplicates are present, returning the appropriate `Piecewise` expression or remaining unevaluated.

It seems the test script timed out. This could be due to various reasons, including the changes we made or unrelated issues. Let's ensure our changes are correct and efficient.

To further investigate, let's add some debug prints to understand where the time is being spent. We will add debug prints in the `__new__` method and `_contains` method of the `Intersection` class.

Here are the changes:

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
=======
        print("Intersection __new__ called with args:", args)
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq
=======
        print("Intersection _contains called with other:", other)
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These debug prints will help us understand if the methods are being called excessively or if there are any other issues.

Please run the test script again and provide the output so we can analyze it further.

It seems the test script is still timing out. Let's optimize our changes to ensure they are efficient and do not cause any performance issues.

We will:
1. Remove the debug prints.
2. Ensure that the duplicate removal and simplification logic is efficient.

Here are the optimized changes:

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)

        # Remove duplicates
        args = list(ordered(set(args), Set._infimum_key))

        # Reduce sets using known rules
        if evaluate:
            args = list(cls._new_args_filter(args))
            return simplify_intersection(args)

        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))
=======
        # flatten inputs to merge intersections and iterables
        args = _sympify(args)

        # Remove duplicates
        args = list(ordered(set(args), Set._infimum_key))

        # Reduce sets using known rules
        if evaluate:
            args = list(cls._new_args_filter(args))
            return simplify_intersection(args)

        args = list(ordered(args, Set._infimum_key))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return And(*[set.contains(other) for set in self.args])
=======
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq

        conditions = [set.contains(other) for set in self.args]
        if len(conditions) != len(set(conditions)):
            return Piecewise((self.args[0], Eq(self.args[0], other)), (S.EmptySet, True))
        return And(*conditions)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please run the test script again and provide the output so we can analyze it further.

Let's correct the *SEARCH/REPLACE block* that failed to match. Here is the corrected block:

sympy/sets/sets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        try:
            d = Dummy()
            r = self.as_relational(d).subs(d, other)
            b = tfn[r]
            if b is None and not any(isinstance(i.contains(other), Contains)
                    for i in self.args):
                return r
            return b
        except (TypeError, NotImplementedError):
            return Or(*[s.contains(other) for s in self.args])
=======
        from sympy import Piecewise, Eq

        conditions = [set.contains(other) for set in self.args]
        if len(conditions) != len(set(conditions)):
            return Piecewise((self.args[0], Eq(self.args[0], other)), (S.EmptySet, True))
        return And(*conditions)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please apply this change and run the test script again.
