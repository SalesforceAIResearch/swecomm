#### delete() on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Deleting any model with no dependencies not updates the PK on the model. It should be set to None after .delete() call.  
#### See Django.db.models.deletion:276-281. Should update the model line 280.

To address the issue where deleting a model instance with no dependencies does not clear the primary key (PK), we need to modify the `delete()` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.

Please add the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

Here is the necessary change to ensure that the primary key (PK) is set to `None` after the `.delete()` call for models without any dependencies:

django/db/models/deletion.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}
=======
                for obj in instances:
                    setattr(obj, model._meta.pk.attname, None)
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/db/models/deletion.py
