#### MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Hi,  
#### We have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following:   
#### class Router(object):  
#### 	def allow_migrate(self, db, model):  
#### 		if db == 'default':  
#### 			return True  
#### 		return False  
#### Current Behaviour  
#### We run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)  
#### When this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied).   
#### The first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish).   
#### ensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table.   
#### I believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.

To address the issue with `MigrationRecorder` not obeying `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods, including `record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, and `ensure_schema`.
2. `django/db/migrations/executor.py` - This file contains the `MigrationExecutor` class and its `apply_migration` method, which calls `self.recorder.record_applied`.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To ensure that `MigrationRecorder` obeys the `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we need to modify the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`. Additionally, we need to update the `apply_migration` method in `django/db/migrations/executor.py` to handle the router logic.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Changes to `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`

1. Modify the `ensure_schema` method to check the router before creating the schema.
2. Update the `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` methods to check the router before recording migrations.

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Make the table
        try:
            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                editor.create_model(self.Migration)
        except DatabaseError as exc:
            raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
=======
        # Check if migration is allowed on this database
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            # Make the table
            try:
                with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                    editor.create_model(self.Migration)
            except DatabaseError as exc:
                raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Changes to `django/db/migrations/executor.py`

1. Update the `apply_migration` method to handle the router logic before recording migrations.

django/db/migrations/executor.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if migration.replaces:
            for app_label, name in migration.replaces:
                self.recorder.record_applied(app_label, name)
        else:
            self.recorder.record_applied(migration.app_label, migration.name)
=======
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, migration):
            if migration.replaces:
                for app_label, name in migration.replaces:
                    self.recorder.record_applied(app_label, name)
            else:
                self.recorder.record_applied(migration.app_label, migration.name)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `MigrationRecorder` and `MigrationExecutor` respect the `db_router` allow_migrate rules.

To fix the errors, we need to import the `router` module in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`. Here are the necessary changes:

### Changes to `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`

1. Import the `router` module.

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
=======
from django.db import router
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will resolve the `undefined name 'router'` errors.
