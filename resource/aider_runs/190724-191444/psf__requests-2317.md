#### method = builtin_str(method) problem  
#### In requests/sessions.py is a command:  
####   
#### method = builtin_str(method)  
#### Converts method from  
#### b’GET’  
#### to  
#### "b'GET’"  
####   
#### Which is the literal string, no longer a binary string.  When requests tries to use the method "b'GET’”, it gets a 404 Not Found response.  
####   
#### I am using python3.4 and python-neutronclient (2.3.9) with requests (2.4.3).  neutronclient is broken because it uses this "args = utils.safe_encode_list(args)" command which converts all the values to binary string, including method.  
####   
#### I'm not sure if this is a bug with neutronclient or a bug with requests, but I'm starting here.  Seems if requests handled the method value being a binary string, we wouldn't have any problem.  
####   
#### Also, I tried in python2.6 and this bug doesn't exist there. Some difference between 2.6 and 3.4 makes this not work right.

To address the issue with `method = builtin_str(method)` in `requests/sessions.py`, we need to modify the code to handle binary strings correctly. The most likely file that needs to be changed is:

- `requests/sessions.py`

Please add `requests/sessions.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To handle the issue with `method = builtin_str(method)` converting binary strings incorrectly, we need to ensure that the method is properly decoded if it is a binary string. Here are the changes:

1. Check if the method is a binary string and decode it if necessary.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

requests/sessions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        method = builtin_str(method)
=======
        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('utf-8')
        method = builtin_str(method)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that if the method is a binary string, it will be decoded to a regular string before being processed further.

It seems the test script is timing out. This could be due to various reasons, including network issues, long-running tests, or other environmental factors. However, the change we made should not cause such a timeout.

Let's ensure that the change is correctly applied and try running the tests again. Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block once more for clarity:

requests/sessions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        method = builtin_str(method)
=======
        if isinstance(method, bytes):
            method = method.decode('utf-8')
        method = builtin_str(method)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please ensure this change is correctly applied and try running the tests again. If the issue persists, we may need to investigate further into the test environment or the specific tests that are causing the timeout.

Given that the test script is timing out, it might be useful to investigate further into the test environment or the specific tests that are causing the timeout. However, the change we made should not cause such a timeout.
