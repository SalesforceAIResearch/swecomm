#### Python 2->3 pickle fails with float-containing expressions  
#### Dumping a pickled sympy expression containing a float in Python 2, then loading it in Python 3 generates an error.  
####   
#### Here is a minimum working example, verified with sympy git commit 3546ac7 (master at time of writing), Python 2.7 and Python 3.6:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### python2 -c 'import pickle; import sympy; x = sympy.symbols("x"); print pickle.dumps(x + 1.0, 2)' | python3 -c 'import pickle; import sys; print(pickle.loads(sys.stdin.buffer.read()))'  
#### ```  
####   
#### and the result:  
####   
#### ```  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
####   File "<string>", line 1, in <module>  
####   File "/Users/alex/git/VU/sympy/sympy/core/numbers.py", line 1045, in __new__  
####     num[1] = long(num[1], 16)  
#### ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'  
#### ```

To address the issue with pickling and unpickling float-containing expressions between Python 2 and Python 3, we will likely need to modify the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file.

Please add the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with pickling and unpickling float-containing expressions between Python 2 and Python 3, we need to modify the `sympy/core/numbers.py` file. Specifically, we need to handle the conversion of long integers correctly when unpickling in Python 3.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/core/numbers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                num[1] = long(num[1], 16)
=======
                num[1] = int(num[1], 16)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the conversion from a hexadecimal string to an integer is done correctly in Python 3.
