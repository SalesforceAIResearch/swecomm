#### Support for serialization of combination of Enum flags.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Willem Van Onsem)  
#### 	   
#### If we work with a field:  
#### regex_flags = models.IntegerField(default=re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE)  
#### This is turned into a migration with:  
#### default=re.RegexFlag[None]  
#### This is due to the fact that the EnumSerializer aims to work with the .name of the item, but if there is no single item for the given value, then there is no such name.  
#### In that case, we can use enum._decompose to obtain a list of names, and create an expression to create the enum value by "ORing" the items together.

To support the serialization of a combination of Enum flags, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To support the serialization of a combination of Enum flags, we need to modify the `EnumSerializer` class in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`. Specifically, we will use `enum._decompose` to handle cases where the value is a combination of Enum flags.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

```python

        return (
            "%s.%s[%r]" % (module, enum_class.__qualname__, self.value.name),

        )

        try:
            return (
                "%s.%s[%r]" % (module, enum_class.__qualname__, self.value.name),
                {"import %s" % module},
            )
        except KeyError:
            # Handle combination of Enum flags
            members, _ = enum_class._decompose(self.value)
            member_names = " | ".join("%s.%s.%s" % (module, enum_class.__qualname__, member.name) for member in members)
            return (
                member_names,
                {"import %s" % module},
            )
