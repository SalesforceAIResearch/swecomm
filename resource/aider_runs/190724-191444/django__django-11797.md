#### Filtering on query result overrides GROUP BY of internal query  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### from django.contrib.auth import models  
#### a = models.User.objects.filter(email__isnull=True).values('email').annotate(m=Max('id')).values('m')  
#### print(a.query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email"  
#### print(a[:1].query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email" LIMIT 1  
#### b = models.User.objects.filter(id=a[:1])  
#### print(b.query) # GROUP BY U0."id" should be GROUP BY U0."email"  
#### # SELECT ... FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."id" = (SELECT U0."id" FROM "auth_user" U0 WHERE U0."email" IS NULL GROUP BY U0."id" LIMIT 1)

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause being overridden, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `django/db/models/query.py`
2. `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause being overridden, we need to ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause in the subquery is preserved correctly. This involves modifying the `resolve_expression` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to handle the `GROUP BY` clause properly.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # It's safe to drop ordering if the queryset isn't using slicing,
        # distinct(*fields) or select_for_update().
        if (self.low_mark == 0 and self.high_mark is None and
                not self.distinct_fields and
                not self.select_for_update):
            clone.clear_ordering(True)
=======
        # It's safe to drop ordering if the queryset isn't using slicing,
        # distinct(*fields), select_for_update(), or group_by.
        if (self.low_mark == 0 and self.high_mark is None and
                not self.distinct_fields and
                not self.select_for_update and
                not self.group_by):
            clone.clear_ordering(True)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `GROUP BY` clause is not dropped when creating a subquery, preserving the correct behavior.

Let's proceed with this change.
