#### skipping: --runxfail breaks pytest.mark.skip location reporting  
#### pytest versions: 5.4.x, current master  
####   
#### When `@pytest.mark.skip`/`skipif` marks are used to skip a test, for example  
####   
#### ```py  
#### import pytest  
#### @pytest.mark.skip  
#### def test_skip_location() -> None:  
####     assert 0  
#### ```  
####   
#### the expected skip location reported should point to the item itself, and this is indeed what happens when running with `pytest -rs`:  
####   
#### ```  
#### SKIPPED [1] test_it.py:3: unconditional skip  
#### ```  
####   
#### However, adding `pytest -rs --runxfail` breaks this:  
####   
#### ```  
#### SKIPPED [1] src/_pytest/skipping.py:238: unconditional skip  
#### ```  
####   
#### The `--runxfail` is only about xfail and should not affect this at all.  
####   
#### ---  
####   
#### Hint: the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook.

To address the issue with `--runxfail` breaking the location reporting for `pytest.mark.skip`, we need to modify the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`.

Please add the file `src/_pytest/skipping.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with `--runxfail` breaking the location reporting for `pytest.mark.skip`, we need to modify the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the location of the skip is correctly reported even when `--runxfail` is used.

Here is the necessary change:

src/_pytest/skipping.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    elif (
        item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True)
        and rep.skipped
        and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple
    ):
        # skipped by mark.skipif; change the location of the failure
        # to point to the item definition, otherwise it will display
        # the location of where the skip exception was raised within pytest
        _, _, reason = rep.longrepr
        filename, line = item.reportinfo()[:2]
        assert line is not None
        rep.longrepr = str(filename), line + 1, reason
=======
    if (
        item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True)
        and rep.skipped
        and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple
    ):
        # skipped by mark.skipif; change the location of the failure
        # to point to the item definition, otherwise it will display
        # the location of where the skip exception was raised within pytest
        _, _, reason = rep.longrepr
        filename, line = item.reportinfo()[:2]
        assert line is not None
        rep.longrepr = str(filename), line + 1, reason
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the location of the skip is correctly reported even when `--runxfail` is used.
