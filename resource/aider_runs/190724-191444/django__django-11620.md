#### When DEBUG is True, raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method does not result in a technical response  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### This is the response I get (plain text):   
#### A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.  
#### I understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver "this path does not match, try next one" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.  
#### One could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver "this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')".  
#### This would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.

To address this issue, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/core/handlers/exception.py` - This file handles exceptions and would need to be modified to ensure that `Http404` raised in a path converter's `to_python` method results in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`.
2. `django/urls/converters.py` - This file defines the path converters and their `to_python` methods. We might need to adjust how exceptions are handled here.

Please add these files to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

To ensure that raising `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method results in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`, we need to make the following changes:

1. Modify `django/core/handlers/exception.py` to handle `Http404` exceptions raised in path converters.
2. Modify `django/urls/converters.py` to raise `Http404` exceptions appropriately.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Modify `django/core/handlers/exception.py`

We need to ensure that `Http404` exceptions raised in path converters are handled correctly and result in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`.

django/core/handlers/exception.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if isinstance(exc, Http404):
        if settings.DEBUG:
            response = debug.technical_404_response(request, exc)
        else:
            response = get_exception_response(request, get_resolver(get_urlconf()), 404, exc)

    elif isinstance(exc, PermissionDenied):
=======
    if isinstance(exc, Http404):
        if settings.DEBUG:
            response = debug.technical_404_response(request, exc)
        else:
            response = get_exception_response(request, get_resolver(get_urlconf()), 404, exc)
        log_response(
            'Not Found: %s', request.path,
            response=response,
            request=request,
            exc_info=sys.exc_info(),
        )

    elif isinstance(exc, PermissionDenied):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Modify `django/urls/converters.py`

We need to ensure that `Http404` exceptions can be raised in the `to_python` methods of path converters.

django/urls/converters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def to_python(self, value):
        return int(value)
=======
    def to_python(self, value):
        try:
            return int(value)
        except ValueError:
            from django.http import Http404
            raise Http404("Invalid integer value")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/urls/converters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def to_python(self, value):
        return uuid.UUID(value)
=======
    def to_python(self, value):
        try:
            return uuid.UUID(value)
        except ValueError:
            from django.http import Http404
            raise Http404("Invalid UUID value")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that raising `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method results in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`.
