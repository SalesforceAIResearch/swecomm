#### Added model class to app_list context  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Raffaele Salmaso)  
#### 	   
#### I need to manipulate the app_list in my custom admin view, and the easiest way to get the result is to have access to the model class (currently the dictionary is a serialized model).  
#### In addition I would make the _build_app_dict method public, as it is used by the two views index and app_index.

To achieve your request, we will need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` - To make the `_build_app_dict` method public and to include the model class in the `app_list` context.

Please add `django/contrib/admin/sites.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Here are the necessary changes to `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`:

1. Make the `_build_app_dict` method public by renaming it to `build_app_dict`.
2. Include the model class in the `app_list` context.

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _build_app_dict(self, request, label=None):
=======
    def build_app_dict(self, request, label=None):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                'perms': perms,
=======
                'model': model,
                'perms': perms,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        app_dict = self._build_app_dict(request)
=======
        app_dict = self.build_app_dict(request)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        app_dict = self._build_app_dict(request, app_label)
=======
        app_dict = self.build_app_dict(request, app_label)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
