#### [Bug]: get_backend() clears figures from Gcf.figs if they were created under rc_context  
#### ### Bug summary  
####   
#### calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the *first* figure in `Gcf.figs` was created in an `rc_context`.  
####   
#### ### Code for reproduction  
####   
#### ```python  
#### import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  
#### from matplotlib import get_backend, rc_context  
####   
#### # fig1 = plt.figure()  # <- UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL WORK  
#### # plt.ion()            # <- ALTERNATIVELY, UNCOMMENT THIS LINE AND IT WILL ALSO WORK  
#### with rc_context():  
####     fig2 = plt.figure()  
#### before = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'  
#### get_backend()  
#### after = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'  
####   
#### assert before == after, '\n' + before + '\n' + after  
#### ```  
####   
####   
#### ### Actual outcome  
####   
#### ```  
#### ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  
#### AssertionError                            Traceback (most recent call last)  
#### <ipython-input-1-fa4d099aa289> in <cell line: 11>()  
####       9 after = f'{id(plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf)} {plt._pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs!r}'  
####      10   
#### ---> 11 assert before == after, '\n' + before + '\n' + after  
####      12   
####   
#### AssertionError:   
#### 94453354309744 OrderedDict([(1, <matplotlib.backends.backend_qt.FigureManagerQT object at 0x7fb33e26c220>)])  
#### 94453354309744 OrderedDict()  
#### ```  
####   
#### ### Expected outcome  
####   
#### The figure should not be missing from `Gcf`.  Consequences of this are, e.g, `plt.close(fig2)` doesn't work because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find it.

To address the bug in `get_backend()` that clears figures from `Gcf.figs` if they were created under `rc_context`, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`
2. `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `get_backend()` does not inadvertently clear figures from `Gcf.figs`. We will:

1. Modify `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py` to ensure that `get_backend()` does not clear figures.
2. Ensure that `Gcf` class in `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` is correctly managing figures.

Here are the necessary changes:
