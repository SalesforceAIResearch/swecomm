#### Test runner setup_databases crashes with "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False}.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I'm trying to upgrade a project from Django 3.0 to Django 3.1 and wanted to try out the new "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False} database setting.  
#### Sadly I'm running into an issue immediately when running ./manage.py test.  
#### Removing the "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False} line allows the tests to run. So this is not blocking the upgrade for us, but it would be nice if we were able to use the new feature to skip migrations during testing.  
#### For reference, this project was recently upgraded from Django 1.4 all the way to 3.0 so there might be some legacy cruft somewhere that triggers this.  
#### Here's the trackeback. I'll try to debug this some more.

To address the issue with the "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False} setting causing a crash during the `setup_databases` step in the test runner, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/test/runner.py`
2. `django/test/utils.py`
3. `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False} setting causing a crash during the `setup_databases` step in the test runner, we need to make the following changes:

1. **Skip serialization if migrations are disabled**: Modify the `create_test_db` method in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` to skip serialization if migrations are disabled.
2. **Handle the absence of migrations gracefully**: Ensure that the test runner and utility functions handle the absence of migrations gracefully.

Here are the necessary changes:

### 1. Modify `create_test_db` in `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`

django/db/backends/base/creation.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['MIGRATE']:
            # We report migrate messages at one level lower than that
            # requested. This ensures we don't get flooded with messages during
            # testing (unless you really ask to be flooded).
            call_command(
                'migrate',
                verbosity=max(verbosity - 1, 0),
                interactive=False,
                database=self.connection.alias,
                run_syncdb=True,
            )

        # We then serialize the current state of the database into a string
        # and store it on the connection. This slightly horrific process is so people
        # who are testing on databases without transactions or who are using
        # a TransactionTestCase still get a clean database on every test run.
        if serialize:
            self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()
=======
        if self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['MIGRATE']:
            # We report migrate messages at one level lower than that

            # testing (unless you really ask to be flooded).
            call_command(
                'migrate',
                verbosity=max(verbosity - 1, 0),
                interactive=False,
                database=self.connection.alias,
                run_syncdb=True,
            )

            # We then serialize the current state of the database into a string
            # and store it on the connection. This slightly horrific process is so people

            if serialize:
                self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 2. Modify `setup_databases` in `django/test/utils.py`

django/test/utils.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    connection.creation.create_test_db(
                        verbosity=verbosity,

                    if connection.settings_dict['TEST']['MIGRATE']:
                        connection.creation.create_test_db(
                            verbosity=verbosity,
                            autoclobber=not interactive,
                            keepdb=keepdb,
                            serialize=connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('SERIALIZE', True),
                        )
                    else:
                        connection.creation.create_test_db(
                            verbosity=verbosity,
                            autoclobber=not interactive,
                            keepdb=keepdb,
                            serialize=False,
                        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 3. Modify `setup_databases` in `django/test/runner.py`

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
=======
        return _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the test runner and utility functions handle the absence of migrations gracefully and skip serialization if migrations are disabled.

### 3. Modify `setup_databases` in `django/test/runner.py`

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
=======
        return _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the test runner and utility functions handle the absence of migrations gracefully and skip serialization if migrations are disabled.
