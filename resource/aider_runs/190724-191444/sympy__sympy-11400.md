To address the issue with `ccode(sinc(x))`, we will need to modify the file responsible for generating C code for SymPy expressions. The most likely file to need changes is:

- `sympy/printing/ccode.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To address the issue with `ccode(sinc(x))`, we need to modify the `sympy/printing/ccode.py` file to handle the `sinc` function. We will add a custom handler for `sinc` that prints the appropriate `Piecewise` expression.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Add `sinc` to the `known_functions` dictionary.
2. Implement a custom `_print_sinc` method to handle the `sinc` function.

sympy/printing/ccode.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}
=======
    "sinc": "sinc",
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/printing/ccode.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _print_sign(self, func):
=======
    def _print_sinc(self, expr):
        from sympy import Piecewise, sin, Ne
        theta = expr.args[0]
        piecewise_expr = Piecewise((sin(theta)/theta, Ne(theta, 0)), (1, True))
        return self._print(piecewise_expr)

    def _print_sign(self, func):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

With these changes, `ccode(sinc(x))` will now correctly print the `Piecewise` expression for the `sinc` function.
