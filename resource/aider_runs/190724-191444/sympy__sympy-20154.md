#### partitions() reusing the output dictionaries  
#### The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring.   
####   
#### I'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way.

To address the issue with the `partitions()` iterator reusing the output dictionaries, we will need to modify the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file.

Please add the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to ensure that the `partitions()` iterator does not reuse the output dictionaries:

sympy/utilities/iterables.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.
    This is for speed:  generating each partition goes quickly,
    taking constant time, independent of n.

    >>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]
    [{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]

    If you want to build a list of the returned dictionaries then
    make a copy of them:

    >>> [p.copy() for p in partitions(6, k=2)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [{2: 3}, {1: 2, 2: 2}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 6}]
=======
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/utilities/iterables.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms
    else:
        yield ms
=======
        yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
    else:
        yield ms.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
