#### `Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles  
#### Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.  
####   
#### This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

To address the issue with the `Permutation` constructor failing with non-disjoint cycles, we will likely need to modify the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file.

Please add `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To handle non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor, we need to modify the constructor to apply the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if has_dups(temp):
            if is_cycle:
                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '
                'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))
            else:
                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
=======
        if has_dups(temp) and not is_cycle:
            raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            for ci in args:
                c = c(*ci)
=======
            aform = list(range(size or max(temp) + 1))
            for cycle in args:
                for i in range(len(cycle) - 1):
                    aform[cycle[i]] = cycle[i + 1]
                aform[cycle[-1]] = cycle[0]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will allow the `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order and returning the resulting permutation.
