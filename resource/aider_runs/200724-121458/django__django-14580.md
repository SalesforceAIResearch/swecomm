#### Missing import statement in generated migration (NameError: name 'models' is not defined)  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### I found a bug in Django's latest release: 3.2.4.   
#### Given the following contents of models.py:  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class MyField(models.TextField):  
#### 	pass  
#### class MyBaseModel(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		abstract = True  
#### class MyMixin:  
#### 	pass  
#### class MyModel(MyMixin, MyBaseModel):  
#### 	name = MyField(primary_key=True)  
#### The makemigrations command will generate the following migration file:  
#### # Generated by Django 3.2.4 on 2021-06-30 19:13  
#### import app.models  
#### from django.db import migrations  
#### class Migration(migrations.Migration):  
#### 	initial = True  
#### 	dependencies = [  
#### 	]  
#### 	operations = [  
#### 		migrations.CreateModel(  
#### 			name='MyModel',  
#### 			fields=[  
#### 				('name', app.models.MyField(primary_key=True, serialize=False)),  
#### 			],  
#### 			options={  
#### 				'abstract': False,  
#### 			},  
#### 			bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model),  
#### 		),  
#### 	]  
#### Which will then fail with the following error:  
####  File "/home/jj/django_example/app/migrations/0001_initial.py", line 7, in <module>  
#### 	class Migration(migrations.Migration):  
####  File "/home/jj/django_example/app/migrations/0001_initial.py", line 23, in Migration  
#### 	bases=(app.models.MyMixin, models.Model),  
#### NameError: name 'models' is not defined  
#### Expected behavior: Django generates a migration file that is valid Python.  
#### Actual behavior: Django generates a migration file that is missing an import statement.  
#### I think this is a bug of the module django.db.migrations.writer, but I'm not sure. I will be happy to assist with debugging.  
#### Thanks for your attention,

To address the issue with the missing import statement in the generated migration file, we need to modify the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file. This file is responsible for generating the migration files, and it needs to ensure that the `models` import is included when necessary.

Please add the following file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes:
- `django/db/migrations/writer.py`

To fix the issue with the missing `models` import statement in the generated migration file, we need to ensure that the `models` import is added when necessary. We will modify the `django/db/migrations/writer.py` file to include this import.

Here are the changes:

1. Ensure that the `models` import is added if it is used in the migration operations.

django/db/migrations/writer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # django.db.migrations is always used, but models import may not be.
=======
        # django.db.migrations is always used, but models import may not be.
        # Ensure models import is added if 'models' is used in operations.
        if any('models.' in operation for operation in operations):
            imports.add("from django.db import models")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that the `models` import is added to the migration file if any of the operations use `models`.
