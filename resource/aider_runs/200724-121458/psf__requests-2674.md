#### urllib3 exceptions passing through requests API  
#### I don't know if it's a design goal of requests to hide urllib3's exceptions and wrap them around requests.exceptions types.  
####   
#### (If it's not IMHO it should be, but that's another discussion)  
####   
#### If it is, I have at least two of them passing through that I have to catch in addition to requests' exceptions. They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)  
####   
#### Thanks!

To address the issue of urllib3 exceptions passing through the requests API, we will need to modify the following files:

1. `requests/exceptions.py` - To define new exceptions that wrap around the urllib3 exceptions.
2. `requests/adapters.py` - To catch the urllib3 exceptions and raise the new requests exceptions.

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to handle the urllib3 exceptions and wrap them in requests exceptions.

First, we will add new exception classes in `requests/exceptions.py`:

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
```
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
=======
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import DecodeError as BaseDecodeError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError as BaseTimeoutError
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
```
class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""
=======
class DecodeError(RequestException, BaseDecodeError):
    """There was an error decoding the response"""

class TimeoutError(RequestException, BaseTimeoutError):
    """The request timed out while trying to connect to the remote server or during data transfer."""
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we will catch these exceptions in `requests/adapters.py` and raise the new requests exceptions:

requests/adapters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from .exceptions import (ConnectionError, ConnectTimeout, ReadTimeout, SSLError,
                         ProxyError, RetryError)
=======
from .exceptions import (ConnectionError, ConnectTimeout, ReadTimeout, SSLError,
                         ProxyError, RetryError, DecodeError, TimeoutError)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/adapters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        except MaxRetryError as e:
            if isinstance(e.reason, ConnectTimeoutError):
                raise ConnectTimeout(e, request=request)

            if isinstance(e.reason, ResponseError):
                raise RetryError(e, request=request)

            raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)

        except _ProxyError as e:
            raise ProxyError(e)

        except (_SSLError, _HTTPError) as e:
            if isinstance(e, _SSLError):
                raise SSLError(e, request=request)
            elif isinstance(e, ReadTimeoutError):
                raise ReadTimeout(e, request=request)
            else:
                raise
=======
        except MaxRetryError as e:
            if isinstance(e.reason, ConnectTimeoutError):
                raise ConnectTimeout(e, request=request)

            if isinstance(e.reason, ResponseError):
                raise RetryError(e, request=request)

            raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)

        except _ProxyError as e:
            raise ProxyError(e)

        except (_SSLError, _HTTPError) as e:
            if isinstance(e, _SSLError):
                raise SSLError(e, request=request)
            elif isinstance(e, ReadTimeoutError):
                raise ReadTimeout(e, request=request)
            elif isinstance(e, BaseDecodeError):
                raise DecodeError(e, request=request)
            elif isinstance(e, BaseTimeoutError):
                raise TimeoutError(e, request=request)
            else:
                raise
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the urllib3 exceptions `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are properly wrapped in requests exceptions.

Here are the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks for `requests/exceptions.py`:

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
=======
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import DecodeError as BaseDecodeError
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import TimeoutError as BaseTimeoutError
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class StreamConsumedError(RequestException, TypeError):
    """The content for this response was already consumed"""


class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""
=======
class StreamConsumedError(RequestException, TypeError):
    """The content for this response was already consumed"""


class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""


class DecodeError(RequestException, BaseDecodeError):
    """There was an error decoding the response"""


class TimeoutError(RequestException, BaseTimeoutError):
    """The request timed out while trying to connect to the remote server or during data transfer."""
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
