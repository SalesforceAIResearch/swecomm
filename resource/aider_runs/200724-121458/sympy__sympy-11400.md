To address the issue with `ccode(sinc(x))`, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `sympy/printing/ccode.py` - This file is responsible for generating C code from SymPy expressions. We need to add support for the `sinc` function here.

Please add `sympy/printing/ccode.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To add support for the `sinc` function in the C code printer, we need to modify the `known_functions` dictionary in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` to include a custom implementation for `sinc`. We will use a `Piecewise` expression to handle the `sinc` function as described.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/printing/ccode.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
}
=======
    "sinc": [(lambda x: True, "((%(arg)s != 0) ? (sin(%(arg)s)/(%(arg)s)) : 1)")]
}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will add a custom implementation for the `sinc` function, using a `Piecewise` expression to handle the case where the argument is zero.
