#### RenameModel with db_table should be a noop.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### A RenameModel operation that already has db_table defined must be a noop.  
#### In Postgres, it drops and recreates foreign key constraints. In sqlite it recreates the table (as expected for a table renaming).

To implement the requested change, we will likely need to modify the `RenameModel` operation in the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file. This is where the logic for renaming models is handled.

Please add the `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To make the `RenameModel` operation a no-op when the `db_table` is already defined, we need to modify the `database_forwards` method in the `RenameModel` class. Specifically, we will add a check to see if the `db_table` of the new model is the same as the `db_table` of the old model. If they are the same, we will skip the renaming process.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/migrations/operations/models.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            # Move the main table
            schema_editor.alter_db_table(
                new_model,
                old_model._meta.db_table,
                new_model._meta.db_table,
            )
=======
            # Move the main table if db_table is different
            if old_model._meta.db_table != new_model._meta.db_table:
                schema_editor.alter_db_table(
                    new_model,
                    old_model._meta.db_table,
                    new_model._meta.db_table,
                )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the `RenameModel` operation will be a no-op if the `db_table` is already defined and remains the same.
