#### delete() on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Deleting any model with no dependencies not updates the PK on the model. It should be set to None after .delete() call.  
#### See Django.db.models.deletion:276-281. Should update the model line 280.

To address the issue where `delete()` on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs, we need to modify the `delete` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.

Please add the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

To ensure that the primary keys (PKs) are set to `None` after the `delete()` call for models without any dependencies, we need to update the `delete` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to make the necessary changes:

django/db/models/deletion.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # update collected instances
        for instances_for_fieldvalues in self.field_updates.values():
            for (field, value), instances in instances_for_fieldvalues.items():
                for obj in instances:
                    setattr(obj, field.attname, value)
        for model, instances in self.data.items():
            for instance in instances:
                setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)
        return sum(deleted_counter.values()), dict(deleted_counter)
