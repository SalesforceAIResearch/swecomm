To address the issue with substitution leading to an undefined expression, we will likely need to make changes in the following files:

1. `sympy/core/basic.py` - This file contains the `Basic` class, which is the base class for all objects in SymPy. The `subs` method is defined here and might need to be modified to handle the substitution more gracefully.
2. `sympy/core/expr.py` - This file contains the `Expr` class, which is a subclass of `Basic` and represents mathematical expressions. The `subs` method in this class might also need to be modified.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To handle the issue with substitution leading to an undefined expression, we need to modify the `subs` method in both `Basic` and `Expr` classes to check for undefined expressions and handle them appropriately.

Here are the changes:

sympy/core/basic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            return rv
=======
            # Check if the result is undefined
            if rv.has(S.ComplexInfinity, S.NaN, S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity):
                return S.NaN
            else:
                return rv
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/core/expr.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            return rv
=======
            # Check if the result is undefined
            if rv.has(S.ComplexInfinity, S.NaN, S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity):
                return S.NaN
            else:
                return rv
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that if the result of a substitution contains undefined expressions, the result will be `NaN`.
