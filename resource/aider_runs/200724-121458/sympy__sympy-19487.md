#### Rewrite sign as abs  
#### In sympy the `sign` function is defined as  
#### ```  
####     sign(z)  :=  z / Abs(z)  
#### ```  
#### for all complex non-zero `z`. There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:  
#### ```  
#### >>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                     
####  x   
#### ───  
#### │x│  
#### ```  
#### I'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have  
#### ```  
#### >>> sign(0)                                                                                                                                 
#### 0  
#### >>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                              
#### nan  
#### ```  
#### Maybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).

To implement the `rewrite` method for the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the changes needed to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`:

1. Add the `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method to the `sign` class.
2. Handle the case where the argument is zero by returning `S.NaN`.

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _eval_simplify(self, **kwargs):
=======
    def _eval_rewrite_as_Abs(self, arg, **kwargs):
        if arg.is_zero:
            return S.NaN
        return arg / Abs(arg)

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return self.func(self.args[0].factor())  # XXX include doit?
=======
        return self.func(self.args[0].factor())  # XXX include doit?

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
