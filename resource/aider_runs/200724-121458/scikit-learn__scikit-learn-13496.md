#### Expose warm_start in Isolation forest  
#### It seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.  
####   
#### Even though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration.   
####   
#### It took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.  
####   
#### To make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:  
#### * expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;  
#### * document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:  
#### ```py  
####     warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)  
####         When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit  
####         and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole  
####         new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.  
#### ```  
#### * add a test to make sure it works properly;  
#### * possibly also mention in the "IsolationForest example" documentation entry;

To expose the `warm_start` parameter in `IsolationForest`, we will need to make changes to the following files:

1. `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py` - To add the `warm_start` parameter to the `__init__` method and update the docstring.
2. `sklearn/ensemble/tests/test_iforest.py` - To add a test case ensuring the `warm_start` functionality works as expected.

Please add the following files to the chat:
- `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py`
- `sklearn/ensemble/tests/test_iforest.py`

Here are the changes needed to expose the `warm_start` parameter in `IsolationForest` and add a test for it:

1. Update `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py` to include the `warm_start` parameter in the `__init__` method and update the docstring.
2. Add a test case in `sklearn/ensemble/tests/test_iforest.py` to ensure the `warm_start` functionality works as expected.

Let's start with the changes to `sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py`:

sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                 verbose=0):
=======
                 verbose=0,
                 warm_start=False):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    Notes
=======
    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

    Notes
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        super().__init__(
=======
        super(IsolationForest, self).__init__(
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sklearn/ensemble/iforest.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            verbose=verbose)
=======
            verbose=verbose,
            warm_start=warm_start)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, let's add a test case in `sklearn/ensemble/tests/test_iforest.py`:

sklearn/ensemble/tests/test_iforest.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
=======
def test_iforest_warm_start():
    """Test IsolationForest with warm_start=True"""
    X = [[-2, -1], [-1, -1], [-1, -2], [1, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1], [6, 3], [-4, 7]]

    # Test IsolationForest with warm_start
    clf = IsolationForest(n_estimators=5, warm_start=True, random_state=rng)
    clf.fit(X)
    first_trees = clf.estimators_

    clf.set_params(n_estimators=10)
    clf.fit(X)
    second_trees = clf.estimators_

    assert len(first_trees) == 5
    assert len(second_trees) == 10
    assert_array_equal(first_trees, second_trees[:5])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will expose the `warm_start` parameter in `IsolationForest` and add a test to ensure it works correctly.
