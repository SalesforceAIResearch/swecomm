#### Label for ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget points to non-labelable element.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by David Sanders)  
#### 	   
#### In the admin, the label element for the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget widget has a 'for' attribute which points to a non-labelable element, since the widget just renders text, not an input. There's no labelable element for the widget, so the label shouldn't have a 'for' attribute.

To address the issue with the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in the admin, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `django/contrib/auth/widgets.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.
