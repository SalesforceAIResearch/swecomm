#### 0**-oo produces 0, the documentation says it should produce zoo  
#### Using SymPy 1.5.1, evaluate `0**-oo` produces `0`.  
####   
#### The documentation for the Pow class states that it should return `ComplexInfinity`, aka `zoo`  
####   
#### | expr | value | reason |  
#### | :-- | :-- | :--|  
#### | `0**-oo` | `zoo` | This is not strictly true, as 0**oo may be oscillating between positive and negative values or rotating in the complex plane. It is convenient, however, when the base is positive.|

To address the issue with `0**-oo` producing `0` instead of `zoo`, we will likely need to make changes to the `Pow` class in the following file:

- `sympy/core/power.py`

Please add `sympy/core/power.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To ensure that `0**-oo` produces `zoo` as per the documentation, we need to modify the `Pow` class in `sympy/core/power.py`. Specifically, we need to update the logic in the `__new__` method to handle this case correctly.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/core/power.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            elif e == -1 and not b:
                return S.ComplexInfinity
=======
            elif e == -1 and not b:
                return S.ComplexInfinity
            elif b is S.Zero and e.is_negative and e.is_infinite:
                return S.ComplexInfinity
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that `0**-oo` returns `zoo` as expected.
