#### Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### As pointed out by ​Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.

To implement logging for exceptions in `Signal.send_robust()`, we will likely need to edit the following file:

- `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To log exceptions handled in `Signal.send_robust()`, we need to:

1. Import the `logging` module.
2. Add a logger instance.
3. Use `logger.exception()` to log exceptions in the `send_robust` method.

To fix the undefined name `err`, we need to capture the exception in the `except` block and then use it in the `responses.append` call.

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            except Exception:
                logger.exception('Error in receiver %s', receiver)
                responses.append((receiver, err))
=======
            except Exception as err:
                logger.exception('Error in receiver %s', receiver)
                responses.append((receiver, err))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
