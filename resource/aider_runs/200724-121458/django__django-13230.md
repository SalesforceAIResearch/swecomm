#### Add support for item_comments to syndication framework  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Add comments argument to feed.add_item() in syndication.views so that item_comments can be defined directly without having to take the detour via item_extra_kwargs .  
#### Additionally, comments is already explicitly mentioned in the feedparser, but not implemented in the view.

To add support for `item_comments` to the syndication framework, we will need to modify the following file:

1. `django/contrib/syndication/views.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add support for `item_comments` to the syndication framework, we need to:

1. Add a method to retrieve `item_comments`.
2. Pass the `comments` argument to `feed.add_item`.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/contrib/syndication/views.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            feed.add_item(
=======
            comments = self._get_dynamic_attr('item_comments', item)
            feed.add_item(
                comments=comments,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/syndication/views.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                **self.item_extra_kwargs(item)
=======
                **self.item_extra_kwargs(item),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will allow `item_comments` to be defined directly without having to use `item_extra_kwargs`.

> Applied edit to django/contrib/syndication/views.py
