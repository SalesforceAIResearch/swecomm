#### Add check for fields of UniqueConstraints.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Marnanel Thurman)  
#### 	   
#### When a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist.  
#### This is in contrast to the older unique_together syntax, which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.  
#### In the attached demonstration, you'll need to uncomment "with_unique_together" in settings.py in order to show that unique_together raises E012.

To add a check for fields of `UniqueConstraints`, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/db/models/options.py` - This file handles model options and is where we can add the check for `UniqueConstraints`.
2. `django/core/checks/models.py` - This file contains the checks for models, and we will need to add a new check for `UniqueConstraints` here.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To implement the check for fields of `UniqueConstraints`, we need to add a new check in `django/core/checks/models.py`. This file will contain the logic to verify that the fields specified in `UniqueConstraints` actually exist.

Please add the file `django/core/checks/models.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.
