#### Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot  
#### This is required since every dot is now significant since blueprints can be nested. An error was already added for endpoint names in 1.0, but should have been added for this as well.

To implement this change, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `src/flask/blueprints.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To raise an error when the blueprint name contains a dot, we need to add a check in the `Blueprint` class's `__init__` method. Here are the necessary changes:

src/flask/blueprints.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.name = name
=======
        if '.' in name:
            raise ValueError("Blueprint name should not contain dots")
        self.name = name
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that an error is raised if the blueprint name contains a dot.

> Applied edit to src/flask/blueprints.py
