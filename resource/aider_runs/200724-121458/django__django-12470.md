#### Inherited model doesn't correctly order by "-pk" when specified on Parent.Meta.ordering  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Given the following model definition:  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class Parent(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		ordering = ["-pk"]  
#### class Child(Parent):  
#### 	pass  
#### Querying the Child class results in the following:  
#### >>> print(Child.objects.all().query)  
#### SELECT "myapp_parent"."id", "myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" FROM "myapp_child" INNER JOIN "myapp_parent" ON ("myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" = "myapp_parent"."id") ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" ASC  
#### The query is ordered ASC but I expect the order to be DESC.

To address the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/models/base.py`: This file contains the `Model` class, which is the base class for all Django models. We may need to adjust how the `Meta.ordering` attribute is inherited and applied.
2. `django/db/models/query.py`: This file contains the `QuerySet` class, which is responsible for constructing and executing database queries. We may need to adjust how the ordering is applied to the query.

Please add these files to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, we need to ensure that the `Meta.ordering` attribute is correctly inherited and applied. We will make changes to both `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/query.py`.

### Changes to `django/db/models/base.py`

1. Ensure that the `Meta.ordering` attribute is correctly inherited by child models.

### Changes to `django/db/models/query.py`

1. Ensure that the ordering is correctly applied when constructing the query.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

#### django/db/models/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                if not hasattr(meta, 'ordering'):
                    new_class._meta.ordering = base_meta.ordering
                if not hasattr(meta, 'get_latest_by'):
                    new_class._meta.get_latest_by = base_meta.get_latest_by
=======
                if not hasattr(meta, 'ordering') or not meta.ordering:
                    new_class._meta.ordering = base_meta.ordering
                if not hasattr(meta, 'get_latest_by') or not meta.get_latest_by:
                    new_class._meta.get_latest_by = base_meta.get_latest_by
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

#### django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        elif self.query.default_ordering and self.query.get_meta().ordering:
=======
        elif self.query.default_ordering and self.query.get_meta().ordering and not self.query.order_by:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `Meta.ordering` attribute is correctly inherited and applied to child models, and that the ordering is correctly applied when constructing the query.
