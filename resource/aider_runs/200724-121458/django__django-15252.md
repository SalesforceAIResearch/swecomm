#### MigrationRecorder does not obey db_router allow_migrate rules  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Hi,  
#### We have a multi-db setup. We have one connection that is for the django project, and several connections that talk to other dbs for information (ie models with managed = False). Django should only create tables in the first connection, never in any of the other connections. We have a simple router that does the following:   
#### class Router(object):  
#### 	def allow_migrate(self, db, model):  
#### 		if db == 'default':  
#### 			return True  
#### 		return False  
#### Current Behaviour  
#### We run our functional tests and the migrate command is called against each connection when the test databases are created (see django/test/runner.py, setup_databases, line 300-ish, which calls django/db/backends/creation.py, create_test_db, line 377-ish)  
#### When this migrate runs, it tries to apply our migrations, which tries to record that a migration has been applied (see django/db/migrations/executor.py, apply_migration, which has several calls to self.recorder.record_applied).   
#### The first thing that record_applied does is a call to self.ensure_schema() (see django/db/migrations/recorder.py, record_applied, lien 66-ish).   
#### ensure_schema checks to see if the Migration model is in the tables in the connection. If it does not find the table then it tries to create the table.   
#### I believe that this is incorrect behaviour when a db_router has been provided. If using the router above, my expectation would be that the table is not created on any connection other than the 'default' connection. Looking at the other methods on the MigrationRecorder, I would expect that there will be similar issues with applied_migrations and record_unapplied.

To address the issue with `MigrationRecorder` not obeying `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` - This file contains the `MigrationRecorder` class and its methods, including `record_applied`, `record_unapplied`, and `ensure_schema`.
2. `django/db/backends/creation.py` - This file contains the `create_test_db` method which is called during the test database setup.
3. `django/test/runner.py` - This file contains the `setup_databases` method which initiates the test database creation process.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To ensure that `MigrationRecorder` obeys the `db_router` allow_migrate rules, we need to modify the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`. Additionally, we need to update the `setup_databases` method in `django/test/runner.py` to ensure that the migration recording respects the router rules.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify `ensure_schema` in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to check the router rules before creating the schema.
2. Modify `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py` to ensure they respect the router rules.
3. Update `setup_databases` in `django/test/runner.py` to ensure the migration recording respects the router rules.

Let's start with the changes to `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`:

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
=======
from django.utils.functional import classproperty
from django.db.utils import ConnectionRouter
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Make the table
        try:
            with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                editor.create_model(self.Migration)
        except DatabaseError as exc:
            raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
=======
        # Check if migration is allowed on this database
        router = ConnectionRouter()
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            # Make the table
            try:
                with self.connection.schema_editor() as editor:
                    editor.create_model(self.Migration)
            except DatabaseError as exc:
                raise MigrationSchemaMissing("Unable to create the django_migrations table (%s)" % exc)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
=======
        router = ConnectionRouter()
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.create(app=app, name=name)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/recorder.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.ensure_schema()
        self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
=======
        router = ConnectionRouter()
        if router.allow_migrate(self.connection.alias, self.Migration):
            self.ensure_schema()
            self.migration_qs.filter(app=app, name=name).delete()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's update `django/test/runner.py`:

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
=======
        old_config = _setup_databases(
            self.verbosity, self.interactive, time_keeper=self.time_keeper, keepdb=self.keepdb,
            debug_sql=self.debug_sql, parallel=self.parallel, **kwargs
        )
        # Ensure migration recording respects router rules
        for connection in connections.all():
            if not router.allow_migrate(connection.alias, MigrationRecorder.Migration):
                connection.disable_constraint_checking()
        return old_config
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `MigrationRecorder` respects the `db_router` allow_migrate rules and that the test database setup process also respects these rules.

To fix the errors, we need to import `router` and `MigrationRecorder` in `django/test/runner.py`.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.crypto import new_hash
=======
from django.utils.crypto import new_hash
from django.db.utils import ConnectionRouter
from django.db.migrations.recorder import MigrationRecorder
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/test/runner.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Ensure migration recording respects router rules
=======
        # Ensure migration recording respects router rules
        router = ConnectionRouter()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `router` and `MigrationRecorder` are properly defined and used in the `setup_databases` method.
