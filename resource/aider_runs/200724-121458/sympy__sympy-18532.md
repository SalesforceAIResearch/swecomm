#### expr.atoms() should return objects with no args instead of subclasses of Atom  
#### `expr.atoms()` with no arguments returns subclasses of `Atom` in `expr`. But the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`.   
####   
#### This should be easy to fix, but one needs to check that this doesn't affect the performance.

To implement the change where `expr.atoms()` returns objects with no `.args` instead of subclasses of `Atom`, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `sympy/core/basic.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the changes needed to modify the `atoms` method to return objects with no `.args` instead of subclasses of `Atom`:

1. Update the `atoms` method in `sympy/core/basic.py`.

sympy/core/basic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        By default, only objects that are truly atomic and can't
        be divided into smaller pieces are returned: symbols, numbers,
        and number symbols like I and pi. It is possible to request
        atoms of any type, however, as demonstrated below.
=======
        By default, only objects that have no args are returned.
        It is possible to request atoms of any type, however, as demonstrated below.
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/core/basic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if types:
            types = tuple(
                [t if isinstance(t, type) else type(t) for t in types])
        else:
            types = (Atom,)
        result = set()
        for expr in preorder_traversal(self):
            if isinstance(expr, types):
                result.add(expr)
        return result
=======
        if not types:
            return {expr for expr in preorder_traversal(self) if not expr.args}
        types = tuple(t if isinstance(t, type) else type(t) for t in types)
        return {expr for expr in preorder_traversal(self) if isinstance(expr, types)}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `expr.atoms()` returns objects with no `.args` by default, while still allowing the user to request atoms of any specific type.
