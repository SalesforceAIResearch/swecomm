#### Correct expected format in invalid DurationField error message  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### If you enter a duration "14:00" into a duration field, it translates to "00:14:00" which is 14 minutes.  
#### The current error message for invalid DurationField says that this should be the format of durations: "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]". But according to the actual behaviour, it should be: "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]", because seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided.  
#### This seems to be a mistake in all Django versions that support the DurationField.  
#### Also the duration fields could have a default help_text with the requested format, because the syntax is not self-explanatory.

To correct the expected format in the invalid `DurationField` error message, the most likely file that needs to be changed is:

- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here is the corrected error message for the `DurationField`:

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        'invalid': _("'%(value)s' value has an invalid format. It must be in "
                     "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu] format.")
=======
        'invalid': _("'%(value)s' value has an invalid format. It must be in "
                     "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu] format.")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
