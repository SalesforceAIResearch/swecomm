#### Squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings. As far as I'm aware, it's a 4.2 release blocker because you cannot get rid of the index_together deprecation warnings without rewriting migrations, see comment.

To address the deprecation warnings related to `Meta.index_together` and transition to `Meta.indexes`, we will need to edit the migration files that contain the `index_together` attribute.

Please add the migration files that contain `Meta.index_together` to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks. These files are typically located in the `migrations` directories of your Django apps.
