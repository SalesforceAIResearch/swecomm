#### Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Let's consider the following operations:   
#### operations = [  
#### 	migrations.AddField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),  
#### 	),  
#### ]  
#### If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:  
#### optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books")   
#### [<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]  
#### Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField.   
#### Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented?   
#### Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like  
#### 		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(  
#### 			operation  
#### 		):  
#### 			return [operation]

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we will likely need to modify the file responsible for the migration optimization logic. The most probable file to need changes is:

- `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we need to modify the `optimize_inner` method in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. Specifically, we need to add logic to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`.

Here are the changes:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
=======
                elif not result or (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name and operation.model_name == other.model_name):
                    # If both operations are AlterField on the same field, reduce them.
                    result = [other]
                    right = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field are reduced properly.

To fix the error, we need to import `AlterField` at the beginning of the file. Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class MigrationOptimizer:
=======
from django.db.migrations.operations.fields import AlterField

class MigrationOptimizer:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result:
=======
                elif not result or (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name and operation.model_name == other.model_name):
                    # If both operations are AlterField on the same field, reduce them.
                    result = [other]
                    right = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's correct the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to ensure it matches the existing code exactly.

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                elif not result or (isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name and operation.model_name == other.model_name):
                    # If both operations are AlterField on the same field, reduce them.
                    result = [other]
                    right = True
                    # Can't perform a right reduction.
                    right = False
=======
                elif not result:
>>>>>>> REPLACE

Let's correct the indentation error by ensuring the `else` block is properly aligned.

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python

                elif not result:
            else:

                elif not result:
