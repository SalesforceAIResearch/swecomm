#### autodoc: The annotation only member in superclass is treated as "undocumented"  
#### **Describe the bug**  
#### autodoc: The annotation only member in superclass is treated as "undocumented".  
####   
#### **To Reproduce**  
####   
#### ```  
#### # example.py  
#### class Foo:  
####     """docstring"""  
####     attr1: int  #: docstring  
####   
####   
#### class Bar(Foo):  
####     """docstring"""  
####     attr2: str  #: docstring  
#### ```  
#### ```  
#### # index.rst  
#### .. autoclass:: example.Bar  
####    :members:  
####    :inherited-members:  
#### ```  
####   
#### `Bar.attr1` is not documented. It will be shown if I give `:undoc-members:` option to the autoclass directive call. It seems the attribute is treated as undocumented.  
####   
#### **Expected behavior**  
#### It should be shown.  
####   
#### **Your project**  
#### No  
####   
#### **Screenshots**  
#### No  
####   
#### **Environment info**  
#### - OS: Mac  
#### - Python version: 3.9.1  
#### - Sphinx version: HEAD of 3.x  
#### - Sphinx extensions: sphinx.ext.autodoc  
#### - Extra tools: No

To address the issue with `autodoc` not documenting annotation-only members in the superclass, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` - This file contains the main logic for the autodoc extension and is the most likely place where changes will be needed to ensure that annotation-only members in superclasses are documented correctly.

Please add `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To ensure that annotation-only members in superclasses are documented correctly, we need to modify the `filter_members` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. This method is responsible for filtering out members that should not be documented.

We will update the logic to ensure that annotation-only members in superclasses are treated as documented members.

Here are the changes:

sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if not has_doc and not self.options.undoc_members:
                if is_filtered_inherited_member(membername, obj):
                    keep = False
                else:
                    keep = False
            else:
                keep = True
=======
            if not has_doc and not self.options.undoc_members:
                if is_filtered_inherited_member(membername, obj):
                    keep = False
                else:
                    # Check if the member is an annotation-only member in the superclass
                    if self.get_attr(self.parent, '__annotations__', {}).get(membername):
                        keep = True
                    else:
                        keep = False
            else:
                keep = True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that annotation-only members in superclasses are treated as documented members and will be included in the documentation.

Let's try again with a more precise *SEARCH/REPLACE* block. Here is the updated block:
