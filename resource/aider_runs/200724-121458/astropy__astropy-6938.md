#### Possible bug in io.fits related to D exponents  
#### I came across the following code in ``fitsrec.py``:  
####   
#### ```python  
####         # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers  
####         if 'D' in format:  
####             output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))  
#### ```  
####   
#### I think this may be incorrect because as far as I can tell ``replace`` is not an in-place operation for ``chararray`` (it returns a copy). Commenting out this code doesn't cause any tests to fail so I think this code isn't being tested anyway.

To address the potential bug in `fitsrec.py` related to the `replace` method not being an in-place operation for `chararray`, we need to:

1. Modify the code to ensure the replacement is correctly assigned back to `output_field`.
2. Add or modify tests to ensure this code is being tested.

The files most likely to need changes are:
- `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py`
- `astropy/io/fits/tests/test_fitsrec.py` (or a similar test file)

Please add `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` and the relevant test file to the chat.

Let's fix the potential bug in `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py` by ensuring the replacement is correctly assigned back to `output_field`.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
=======
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field[:] = np.char.replace(output_field, encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to ensure this code is being tested. Please add the relevant test file, likely `astropy/io/fits/tests/test_fitsrec.py`, to the chat.
