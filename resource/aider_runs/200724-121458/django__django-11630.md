#### Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Error message:  
#### table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.  
#### We have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.  
#### We have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names.   
#### Is this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.

To address the issue of Django throwing an error when different apps with different models have the same table name, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/db/models/base.py`: This file contains the `Model` class, which is responsible for defining the behavior of Django models. We may need to adjust the logic that checks for duplicate table names.

2. `django/core/checks/models.py`: This file contains the checks that Django performs on models. We may need to modify or add a check to handle the case where multiple models have the same table name but are in different databases.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue of Django throwing an error when different apps with different models have the same table name, we need to modify the `django/core/checks/models.py` file. This file contains the checks that Django performs on models, and we need to adjust the logic that checks for duplicate table names to account for different databases.
