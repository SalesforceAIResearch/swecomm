#### Two sections called Symbols in index  
#### When using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we will likely need to modify the file responsible for generating the index and handling the symbols. The most likely file to need changes is:

- `sphinx/writers/html.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we need to modify the `HTMLTranslator` class in `sphinx/writers/html.py`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the symbols are grouped correctly and that the anchors are unique.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `visit_index` method to handle symbols correctly.
2. Ensure that the anchors for the "Symbols" sections are unique.

Let's proceed with the changes:

sphinx/writers/html.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
        raise nodes.SkipNode
=======
    def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
        if 'entries' in node:
            for entry in node['entries']:
                if entry[0] == 'single':
                    targetname = 'index-%s' % entry[2]
                    self.body.append(self.starttag(node, 'a', '', CLASS='index', name=targetname))
                    self.body.append('</a>')
        raise nodes.SkipNode
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that each index entry has a unique anchor, which should resolve the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output.
