#### Comparing string to array in _estimate_mi  
#### In ``_estimate_mi`` there is ``discrete_features == 'auto'`` but discrete features can be an array of indices or a boolean mask.  
#### This will error in future versions of numpy.  
#### Also this means we never test this function with discrete features != 'auto', it seems?

To address the issue with comparing `discrete_features` to a string in `_estimate_mi`, we will need to edit the file where `_estimate_mi` is defined. Based on the provided summaries, it is likely that `_estimate_mi` is defined in one of the following files:

- `sklearn/feature_selection/_mutual_info.py`
- `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`
- `sklearn/metrics/cluster/unsupervised.py`

Please add the relevant file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with comparing `discrete_features` to a string in `_estimate_mi`, we need to:

1. Update the comparison to handle cases where `discrete_features` can be an array of indices or a boolean mask.
2. Ensure that the function is tested with `discrete_features` not equal to `'auto'`.

Let's proceed with the changes in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py`:

sklearn/metrics/cluster/supervised.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def _estimate_mi(X, Y, discrete_features='auto', n_neighbors=3, copy=True, random_state=None):
    if discrete_features == 'auto':
        discrete_mask = np.array([is_discrete(x) for x in X.T])
    else:
        discrete_mask = np.asarray(discrete_features)
=======
def _estimate_mi(X, Y, discrete_features='auto', n_neighbors=3, copy=True, random_state=None):
    if isinstance(discrete_features, str) and discrete_features == 'auto':
        discrete_mask = np.array([is_discrete(x) for x in X.T])
    else:
        discrete_mask = np.asarray(discrete_features)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the comparison to `'auto'` is only made when `discrete_features` is a string, preventing potential errors in future versions of numpy.

It seems that `_estimate_mi` is not present in the provided files. We need to locate the correct file where `_estimate_mi` is defined. Based on the context, it is likely in `sklearn/feature_selection/_mutual_info.py`.

Please add the file `sklearn/feature_selection/_mutual_info.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.
