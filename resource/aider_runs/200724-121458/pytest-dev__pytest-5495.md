#### Confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings  
#### The comparison with assertion rewriting for byte strings is confusing:   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"42"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'42'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 52  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'42'  
#### E         ?   ++  
#### ```  
####   
#### 52 is the ASCII ordinal of "4" here.  
####   
#### It became clear to me when using another example:  
####   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"1"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'1'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 49  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'1'  
#### E         ?   +  
#### ```  
####   
#### Not sure what should/could be done here.

To address the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings, we will likely need to make changes in the following files:

1. `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` - This file handles the assertion rewriting logic.
2. `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` - This file contains utility functions for assertion rewriting.
3. `testing/test_assertrewrite.py` - This file contains tests for assertion rewriting.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings, we will:

1. Update the `_diff_text` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py` to handle byte strings more clearly.
2. Add a test case in `testing/test_assertrewrite.py` to ensure the new behavior is correct.

Here are the changes:

### Update `_diff_text` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/util.py`

src/_pytest/assertion/util.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if isinstance(left, bytes):
        left = escape_for_readable_diff(left)
    if isinstance(right, bytes):
        right = escape_for_readable_diff(right)
=======
    if isinstance(left, bytes) and isinstance(right, bytes):
        left = repr(left)
        right = repr(right)
    else:
        if isinstance(left, bytes):
            left = escape_for_readable_diff(left)
        if isinstance(right, bytes):
            right = escape_for_readable_diff(right)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Add a test case in `testing/test_assertrewrite.py`

testing/test_assertrewrite.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def test_boolop(self):
=======
    def test_bytes_comparison(self):
        def f():
            assert b"" == b"42"

        assert getmsg(f) == (
            "assert b'' == b'42'\n"
            "  Right contains more items, first extra item: 52\n"
            "  Full diff:\n"
            "  - b''\n"
            "  + b'42'\n"
            "  ?   ++"
        )

        def f():
            assert b"" == b"1"

        assert getmsg(f) == (
            "assert b'' == b'1'\n"
            "  Right contains more items, first extra item: 49\n"
            "  Full diff:\n"
            "  - b''\n"
            "  + b'1'\n"
            "  ?   +"
        )

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that byte string comparisons are handled more clearly in assertion messages.
