#### Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Django allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.  
#### I have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.

To implement this change, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/contrib/admin/options.py` - This file contains the `InlineModelAdmin` class where we need to set the default for `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name`.

Please add `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to the chat.

To implement the change where `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline class should by default be based on the `verbose_name` if that is specified, we need to modify the `InlineModelAdmin` class in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`.

Here are the necessary changes:

1. Update the `__init__` method of the `InlineModelAdmin` class to set `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if `verbose_name_plural` is not explicitly provided.

django/contrib/admin/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
=======
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            if self.verbose_name is not None:
                self.verbose_name_plural = format_lazy('{}s', self.verbose_name)
            else:
                self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if `verbose_name` is specified for an Inline class, `verbose_name_plural` will default to the plural form of `verbose_name`. If `verbose_name` is not specified, it will fall back to the model's `verbose_name_plural`.
