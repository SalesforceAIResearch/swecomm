#### delete() on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Deleting any model with no dependencies not updates the PK on the model. It should be set to None after .delete() call.  
#### See Django.db.models.deletion:276-281. Should update the model line 280.

To address the issue where `delete()` on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs, we need to modify the `delete` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.

Please add the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

To ensure that the primary keys (PKs) are set to `None` after the `delete()` call for models without any dependencies, we need to update the `delete` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.

Here is the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block to make the necessary changes:

django/db/models/deletion.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Optimize for the case with a single obj and no dependencies
        if len(self.data) == 1 and len(instances) == 1:
            instance = list(instances)[0]
            if self.can_fast_delete(instance):
                with transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error():
                    count = sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch([instance.pk], self.using)
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}
=======
        # Optimize for the case with a single obj and no dependencies
        if len(self.data) == 1 and len(instances) == 1:
            instance = list(instances)[0]
            if self.can_fast_delete(instance):
                with transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error():
                    count = sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch([instance.pk], self.using)
                # Ensure the PK is set to None after deletion
                setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the primary key is set to `None` after the `delete()` call for models without any dependencies.
