#### Migration optimizer does not reduce multiple AlterField  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Let's consider the following operations:   
#### operations = [  
#### 	migrations.AddField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=256, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help"),  
#### 	),  
#### 	migrations.AlterField(  
#### 		model_name="book",  
#### 		name="title",  
#### 		field=models.CharField(max_length=128, null=True, help_text="help", default=None),  
#### 	),  
#### ]  
#### If I run the optimizer, I get only the AddField, as we could expect. However, if the AddField model is separated from the AlterField (e.g. because of a non-elidable migration, or inside a non-squashed migration), none of the AlterField are reduced:  
#### optimizer.optimize(operations[1:], "books")   
#### [<AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>,  
####  <AlterField model_name='book', name='title', field=<django.db.models.fields.CharField>>]  
#### Indeed, the AlterField.reduce does not consider the the case where operation is also an AlterField.   
#### Is this behaviour intended? If so, could it be documented?   
#### Otherwise, would it make sense to add something like  
#### 		if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(  
#### 			operation  
#### 		):  
#### 			return [operation]

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we will likely need to modify the file responsible for the migration optimization logic. Based on the description, the relevant file is:

- `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the migration optimizer not reducing multiple `AlterField` operations, we need to modify the `optimize_inner` method in `django/db/migrations/optimizer.py`. Specifically, we will add logic to handle the case where the operation is also an `AlterField`.

Here are the changes:

1. Add a check to see if both operations are `AlterField` and if they are for the same field.
2. If they are, reduce them into a single `AlterField`.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                result = operation.reduce(other, app_label)
                if isinstance(result, list):
                    in_between = operations[i + 1 : i + j + 1]
                    if right:
                        new_operations.extend(in_between)
                        new_operations.extend(result)
                    elif all(op.reduce(other, app_label) is True for op in in_between):
                        # Perform a left reduction if all of the in-between
                        # operations can optimize through other.
                        new_operations.extend(result)
                        new_operations.extend(in_between)
                    else:
                        # Otherwise keep trying.
                        new_operations.append(operation)
                        break
                    new_operations.extend(operations[i + j + 2 :])
                    return new_operations
                elif not result:
                    # Can't perform a right reduction.
                    right = False
=======
                if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and isinstance(other, AlterField) and operation.name == other.name:
                    # Reduce multiple AlterField operations into one
                    operation = other
                else:
                    result = operation.reduce(other, app_label)
                    if isinstance(result, list):
                        in_between = operations[i + 1 : i + j + 1]
                        if right:
                            new_operations.extend(in_between)
                            new_operations.extend(result)
                        elif all(op.reduce(other, app_label) is True for op in in_between):
                            # Perform a left reduction if all of the in-between
                            # operations can optimize through other.
                            new_operations.extend(result)
                            new_operations.extend(in_between)
                        else:
                            # Otherwise keep trying.
                            new_operations.append(operation)
                            break
                        new_operations.extend(operations[i + j + 2 :])
                        return new_operations
                    elif not result:
                        # Can't perform a right reduction.
                        right = False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will ensure that multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field are reduced into a single `AlterField` operation.

To fix the error, we need to import `AlterField` at the top of the file. Let's add the necessary import statement.

Here are the changes:

django/db/migrations/optimizer.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class MigrationOptimizer:
=======
from django.db.migrations.operations.fields import AlterField

class MigrationOptimizer:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will resolve the `undefined name 'AlterField'` error.
