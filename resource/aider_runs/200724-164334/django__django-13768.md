#### Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### As pointed out by â€‹Haki Benita on Twitter, by default Signal.send_robust() doesn't have any log messages for exceptions raised in receivers. Since Django logs exceptions in other similar situations, such as missing template variables, I think it would be worth adding a logger.exception() call in the except clause of send_robust() . Users would then see such exceptions in their error handling tools, e.g. Sentry, and be able to figure out what action to take from there. Ultimately any *expected* exception should be caught with a try in the receiver function.

To implement logging for exceptions handled in `Signal.send_robust()`, we will most likely need to edit the following file:

- `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To log exceptions handled in `Signal.send_robust()`, we need to:

1. Import the `logging` module.
2. Add a `logger` instance.
3. Use `logger.exception()` in the `except` block of `send_robust()`.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
import threading
import warnings
import weakref

from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning
from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs
=======
import threading
import warnings
import weakref
import logging

from django.utils.deprecation import RemovedInDjango40Warning
from django.utils.inspect import func_accepts_kwargs

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/dispatch/dispatcher.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            else:
=======
                logger.exception(
                    "Error in signal handler for sender %r", sender
                )
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that any exceptions raised in the receivers are logged, providing better visibility into issues that occur during signal handling.
