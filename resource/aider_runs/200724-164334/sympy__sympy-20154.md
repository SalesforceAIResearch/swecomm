#### partitions() reusing the output dictionaries  
#### The partitions() iterator in sympy.utilities.iterables reuses the output dictionaries. There is a caveat about it in the docstring.   
####   
#### I'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way.

To address the issue with the `partitions()` iterator reusing the output dictionaries, we need to modify the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file. This file contains the implementation of the `partitions()` function.

Please add the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to ensure that the `partitions()` function does not reuse the output dictionaries:

sympy/utilities/iterables.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if size:
            yield sum(ms.values()), ms
        else:
            yield ms
=======
        if size:
            yield sum(ms.values()), ms.copy()
        else:
            yield ms.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that a copy of the dictionary is yielded each time, preventing the reuse of the same dictionary object.
