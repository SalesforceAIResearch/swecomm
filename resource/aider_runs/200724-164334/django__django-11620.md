#### When DEBUG is True, raising Http404 in a path converter's to_python method does not result in a technical response  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### This is the response I get (plain text):   
#### A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator.  
#### I understand a ValueError should be raised which tells the URL resolver "this path does not match, try next one" but Http404 is what came to my mind intuitively and the error message was not very helpful.  
#### One could also make a point that raising a Http404 should be valid way to tell the resolver "this is indeed the right path but the current parameter value does not match anything so stop what you are doing and let the handler return the 404 page (including a helpful error message when DEBUG is True instead of the default 'Django tried these URL patterns')".  
#### This would prove useful for example to implement a path converter that uses get_object_or_404.

To address the issue where raising `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method does not result in a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`, we will likely need to modify the URL resolver logic to handle `Http404` exceptions appropriately.

The most likely file that will need changes is:
- `django/urls/resolvers.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To handle the `Http404` exception in the `to_python` method of path converters and ensure that a technical response is provided when `DEBUG` is `True`, we need to modify the `resolve` method in the `URLResolver` class.

Here are the changes:

1. Catch the `Http404` exception in the `resolve` method.
2. If `DEBUG` is `True`, re-raise the `Http404` exception to provide a technical response.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/urls/resolvers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                        except ValueError:
                            return None
=======
                        except ValueError:
                            return None
                        except Http404 as e:
                            if settings.DEBUG:
                                raise
                            return None
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if `Http404` is raised in the `to_python` method, it will provide a technical response when `DEBUG` is `True`.

To fix the error, we need to import `Http404` from `django.http` at the beginning of the file. Here are the changes:

django/urls/resolvers.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.translation import get_language
=======
from django.utils.translation import get_language
from django.http import Http404
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that `Http404` is defined and can be used in the `except` block.
