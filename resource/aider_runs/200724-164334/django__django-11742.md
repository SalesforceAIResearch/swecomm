#### Add check to ensure max_length fits longest choice.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### There is currently no check to ensure that Field.max_length is large enough to fit the longest value in Field.choices.  
#### This would be very helpful as often this mistake is not noticed until an attempt is made to save a record with those values that are too long.

To add a check ensuring that `Field.max_length` is large enough to fit the longest value in `Field.choices`, we will likely need to edit the following file:

- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add a check ensuring that `Field.max_length` is large enough to fit the longest value in `Field.choices`, we will:

1. Add a new method `_check_max_length_with_choices` to the `Field` class.
2. Call this method within the `check` method of the `Field` class.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        ]
=======
            *self._check_max_length_with_choices(),
        ]

    def _check_max_length_with_choices(self):
        """
        Check if max_length is large enough to fit the longest value in choices.
        """
        if self.choices and self.max_length is not None:
            longest_choice = max((len(str(choice)) for choice, _ in self.flatchoices), default=0)
            if longest_choice > self.max_length:
                return [
                    checks.Error(
                        f"'max_length' is too small to fit the longest value in 'choices'. "
                        f"Longest value has {longest_choice} characters, but 'max_length' is {self.max_length}.",
                        obj=self,
                        id='fields.E009',
                    )
                ]
        return []
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `Field` class now checks if `max_length` is large enough to fit the longest value in `choices`.
