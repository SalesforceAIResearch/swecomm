#### Add `nonform` CSS class for non form errors in FormSets  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Ties Jan Hefting)  
#### 	   
#### Forms add the nonfield CSS class for non field errors in ErrorList instances. This is documented in a section on â€‹rendering form error messages. Similarly, in FormSets I'd expect to see the nonform CSS class added for non form errors. This would allow a custom ErrorList to make a distinction in form field errors, non field errors (forms) and non form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. Therefore I'd suggest to add this nonform CSS class and document it for developers to use.

To add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, we will likely need to edit the following files:

1. `django/forms/formsets.py` - This file contains the FormSet class and is where we will add the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors.
2. `django/forms/utils.py` - This file contains the ErrorList class, which may need to be updated to handle the new `nonform` CSS class.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, we need to:

1. Update the `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py` to add the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors.
2. Ensure that the `ErrorList` class in `django/forms/utils.py` can handle the new `nonform` CSS class.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Update `BaseFormSet` in `django/forms/formsets.py`

django/forms/formsets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._non_form_errors = self.error_class()
=======
        self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(error_class='nonform')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Ensure `ErrorList` can handle the new `nonform` CSS class in `django/forms/utils.py`

django/forms/utils.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            self.error_class = 'errorlist'
=======
            self.error_class = 'errorlist nonform' if 'nonform' in initlist else 'errorlist'
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will add the `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors in FormSets and ensure that the `ErrorList` class can handle this new class.
