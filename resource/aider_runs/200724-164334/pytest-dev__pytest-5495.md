#### Confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings  
#### The comparison with assertion rewriting for byte strings is confusing:   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"42"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'42'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 52  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'42'  
#### E         ?   ++  
#### ```  
####   
#### 52 is the ASCII ordinal of "4" here.  
####   
#### It became clear to me when using another example:  
####   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"1"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'1'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 49  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'1'  
#### E         ?   +  
#### ```  
####   
#### Not sure what should/could be done here.

To address the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`: This file handles the assertion rewriting logic and is the most likely place to implement changes to improve the error messages for byte string comparisons.

Please add `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To improve the error messages for byte string comparisons, we need to modify the `_call_reprcompare` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`. This function is responsible for generating custom comparison messages.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify `_call_reprcompare` to handle byte string comparisons more clearly by converting byte values to their ASCII characters.

Let's proceed with the changes:

src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return expl
=======
    if ops[i] == "==":
        if isinstance(each_obj[i], bytes) and isinstance(each_obj[i + 1], bytes):
            custom = (
                f"{each_obj[i]!r} == {each_obj[i + 1]!r}\n"
                f"Right contains more items, first extra item: {each_obj[i + 1][0]}"
                f" ({chr(each_obj[i + 1][0])})\n"
                f"Full diff:\n"
                f"- {each_obj[i]!r}\n"
                f"+ {each_obj[i + 1]!r}\n"
                f"? {'^' * len(each_obj[i + 1])}\n"
            )
            return custom
    return expl
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will provide a more detailed and clear error message for byte string comparisons, including the ASCII character representation of the differing byte.
