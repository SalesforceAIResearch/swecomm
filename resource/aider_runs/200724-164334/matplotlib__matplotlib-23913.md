#### legend draggable as keyword

#### ### Feature request  
####   
#### **There is not keyword to make legend draggable at creation**  
####   
#### <!--A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug-->  
####   
#### Is there a code reason why one can not add a "draggable=True" keyword to the __init__ function for Legend?  This would be more handy than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason why it would not work?

To add a "draggable" keyword to the `Legend` class, we will likely need to edit the following files:

1. `lib/matplotlib/legend.py` - This file contains the `Legend` class where we need to add the `draggable` keyword to the `__init__` method and handle its functionality.

Please add `lib/matplotlib/legend.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add the "draggable" keyword to the `Legend` class, we need to:

1. Add the `draggable` parameter to the `__init__` method.
2. Set the draggable state based on the `draggable` parameter.

Here are the necessary changes:

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        *,
=======
        draggable=False,
        *,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._draggable = None
=======
        self._draggable = None
        self.set_draggable(draggable)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to lib/matplotlib/legend.py
