#### Cannot parse Greek characters (and possibly others) in parse_mathematica  
#### The old Mathematica parser `mathematica` in the package `sympy.parsing.mathematica` was able to parse e.g. Greek characters. Hence the following example works fine:  
#### ```  
#### from sympy.parsing.mathematica import mathematica  
#### mathematica('λ')  
#### Out[]:   
#### λ  
#### ```  
####   
#### As of SymPy v. 1.11, the `mathematica` function is deprecated, and is replaced by `parse_mathematica`. This function, however, seems unable to handle the simple example above:  
#### ```  
#### from sympy.parsing.mathematica import parse_mathematica  
#### parse_mathematica('λ')  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
#### ...  
#### File "<string>", line unknown  
#### SyntaxError: unable to create a single AST for the expression  
#### ```  
####   
#### This appears to be due to a bug in `parse_mathematica`, which is why I have opened this issue.  
####   
#### Thanks in advance!

To address the issue with `parse_mathematica` not being able to handle Greek characters, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `parse_mathematica` not being able to handle Greek characters, we need to update the regular expressions used in the tokenizer to include Unicode characters. Specifically, we need to modify the `_literal` pattern to allow for Greek and other Unicode characters.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/parsing/mathematica.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    _literal = r"[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*"
=======
    _literal = r"[\w][\w\d]*"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will allow the `_literal` pattern to match any Unicode word character, which includes Greek characters and other Unicode characters.

Let's implement this change.
