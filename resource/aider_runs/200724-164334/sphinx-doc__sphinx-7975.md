#### Two sections called Symbols in index  
#### When using index entries with the following leading characters: _@_, _£_, and _←_ I get two sections called _Symbols_ in the HTML output, the first containing all _@_ entries before ”normal” words and the second containing _£_ and _←_ entries after the ”normal” words.  Both have the same anchor in HTML so the links at the top of the index page contain two _Symbols_ links, one before the letters and one after, but both lead to the first section.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `sphinx/writers/html.py` - This file is responsible for generating the HTML output, including the index sections.
2. `sphinx/directives/other.py` - This file might contain directives related to index entries.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue of having two sections called "Symbols" in the HTML output, we need to ensure that the index entries are correctly categorized and that the HTML output handles these categories properly.

We'll make the following changes:

1. Modify `sphinx/writers/html.py` to handle the categorization of symbols correctly.
2. Ensure that the index entries are processed correctly in `sphinx/directives/other.py`.

Let's start with `sphinx/writers/html.py`:

sphinx/writers/html.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
        raise nodes.SkipNode
=======
    def visit_index(self, node: Element) -> None:
        # Handle index entries with special characters correctly
        for entry in node['entries']:
            if entry[0] == 'single':
                entry_text = entry[2]
                if entry_text[0] in '@£←':
                    entry_text = 'Symbols: ' + entry_text
                self.body.append(self.starttag(node, 'a', '', CLASS='index', href='#index-%s' % entry_text))
                self.body.append(entry_text)
                self.body.append('</a>')
        raise nodes.SkipNode
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's ensure that the index entries are processed correctly in `sphinx/directives/other.py`:

sphinx/directives/other.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from sphinx.util.nodes import explicit_title_re
=======
from sphinx.util.nodes import explicit_title_re, make_id
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sphinx/directives/other.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        subnode['entries'] = []
=======
        subnode['entries'] = []
        subnode['symbols'] = []
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sphinx/directives/other.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    toctree['entries'].append((None, docname))
=======
                    if entry[0] in '@£←':
                        toctree['symbols'].append((None, docname))
                    else:
                        toctree['entries'].append((None, docname))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should ensure that the index entries with special characters are categorized under a single "Symbols" section and that the HTML output handles these categories correctly.
