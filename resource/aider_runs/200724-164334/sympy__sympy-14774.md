#### Latex printer does not support full inverse trig function names for acsc and asec  
#### For example  
#### `latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style="full")` works as expected returning `'\\arcsin{\\left (x \\right )}'`  
#### But `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style="full")` gives `'\\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'` instead of `'\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'`  
####   
#### A fix seems to be to change line 743 of sympy/printing/latex.py from  
#### `inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acot"]` to  
#### `inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acsc", "asec", "acot"]`

To address the issue with the `latex` printer not supporting full inverse trig function names for `acsc` and `asec`, we need to edit the file `sympy/printing/latex.py`.

Please add the file `sympy/printing/latex.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

Here is the necessary change to support full inverse trig function names for `acsc` and `asec`:

sympy/printing/latex.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acot"]
=======
            inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acsc", "asec", "acot"]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to sympy/printing/latex.py
