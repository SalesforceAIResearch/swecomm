#### Correct expected format in invalid DurationField error message  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### If you enter a duration "14:00" into a duration field, it translates to "00:14:00" which is 14 minutes.  
#### The current error message for invalid DurationField says that this should be the format of durations: "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]". But according to the actual behaviour, it should be: "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]", because seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided.  
#### This seems to be a mistake in all Django versions that support the DurationField.  
#### Also the duration fields could have a default help_text with the requested format, because the syntax is not self-explanatory.

To correct the expected format in the invalid `DurationField` error message, the most likely file that will need changes is:

- `django/forms/fields.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to correct the expected format in the invalid `DurationField` error message and add a default `help_text` with the requested format:

django/forms/fields.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    }
=======
    }
    help_text = _('Enter a duration in the format [DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/forms/fields.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        'invalid': _('Enter a valid duration.'),
=======
        'invalid': _('Enter a valid duration in the format [DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu].'),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will update the error message and add a default help text to guide users on the correct format for entering durations.

> Applied edit to django/forms/fields.py
