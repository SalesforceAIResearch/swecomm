#### Issue with a substitution that leads to an undefined expression  
#### ```  
#### Python 3.6.4 |Anaconda custom (64-bit)| (default, Dec 21 2017, 15:39:08)

#### In [2]: a,b = symbols('a,b')  
####

#### If b is substituted by a, r is undefined. It is possible to calculate the limit

#### But whenever a subexpression of r is undefined, r itself is undefined.

To address the issue with substitution leading to an undefined expression, we will likely need to make changes in the following files:

1. `sympy/core/expr.py` - This file contains the `Expr` class, which is the base class for all expressions in SymPy. The `subs` method is defined here and will need to be modified to handle cases where the substitution leads to an undefined expression.

2. `sympy/core/basic.py` - This file contains the `Basic` class, which is the base class for all objects in SymPy. The `subs` method is also defined here and may need to be modified to handle cases where the substitution leads to an undefined expression.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To handle the issue where substitution leads to an undefined expression, we need to modify the `subs` method in both `sympy/core/expr.py` and `sympy/core/basic.py` to check for undefined expressions and handle them appropriately.

Here are the changes:

sympy/core/expr.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
            if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                break
            return rv
=======
            try:
                rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                    break
                if rv.has(S.ComplexInfinity, S.NaN, S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity):
                    return S.NaN
                return rv
            except ZeroDivisionError:
                return S.NaN
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/core/basic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        rv = self._eval_subs(old, new)
        if rv is None:
            rv = fallback(self, old, new)
        return rv
=======
        try:
            rv = self._eval_subs(old, new)
            if rv is None:
                rv = fallback(self, old, new)
            if rv.has(S.ComplexInfinity, S.NaN, S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity):
                return S.NaN
            return rv
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            return S.NaN
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE block* for `sympy/core/expr.py`:

sympy/core/expr.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            rv = self
            for old, new in sequence:
                rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
                if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                    break
            return rv
=======
            rv = self
            for old, new in sequence:
                try:
                    rv = rv._subs(old, new, **kwargs)
                    if not isinstance(rv, Basic):
                        break
                    if rv.has(S.ComplexInfinity, S.NaN, S.Infinity, S.NegativeInfinity):
                        return S.NaN
                except ZeroDivisionError:
                    return S.NaN
            return rv
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
