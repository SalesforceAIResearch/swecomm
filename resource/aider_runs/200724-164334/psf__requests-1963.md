#### `Session.resolve_redirects` copies the original request for all subsequent requests, can cause incorrect method selection  
#### Consider the following redirection chain:  
####   
#### ```  
#### POST /do_something HTTP/1.1  
#### Host: server.example.com  
#### ...  
####   
#### HTTP/1.1 303 See Other  
#### Location: /new_thing_1513  
####   
#### GET /new_thing_1513  
#### Host: server.example.com  
#### ...  
####   
#### HTTP/1.1 307 Temporary Redirect  
#### Location: //failover.example.com/new_thing_1513  
#### ```  
####   
#### The intermediate 303 See Other has caused the POST to be converted to  
#### a GET.  The subsequent 307 should preserve the GET.  However, because  
#### `Session.resolve_redirects` starts each iteration by copying the _original_  
#### request object, Requests will issue a POST!

To address the issue with `Session.resolve_redirects` copying the original request for all subsequent requests, we will need to modify the `requests/sessions.py` file.

Please add `requests/sessions.py` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `Session.resolve_redirects` copying the original request for all subsequent requests, we need to modify the method to copy the last request instead of the original one. This will ensure that the method selection is preserved correctly through the redirection chain.

Here are the necessary changes:

requests/sessions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            prepared_request = req.copy()
=======
            prepared_request = resp.request.copy()
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/sessions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            method = req.method
=======
            method = prepared_request.method
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that each subsequent request in the redirection chain is based on the last request, preserving any changes to the method that occurred due to previous redirects.

> Applied edit to requests/sessions.py
