#### QuerySet.defer() doesn't clear deferred field when chaining with only().  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Considering a simple Company model with four fields: id, name, trade_number and country. If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example:   
#### Company.objects.only("name").defer("name")  
#### loads all the fields with the following query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."name", "company"."trade_number", "company"."country" FROM "company"  
#### and   
#### Company.objects.only("name").defer("name").defer("country")  
#### also loads all the fields with the same query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."name", "company"."trade_number", "company"."country" FROM "company"  
#### In those two cases, i would expect the sql query to be:  
#### SELECT "company"."id" FROM "company"  
#### In the following example, we get the expected behavior:  
#### Company.objects.only("name", "country").defer("name")  
#### only loads "id" and "country" fields with the following query:  
#### SELECT "company"."id", "company"."country" FROM "company"

To address the issue with `QuerySet.defer()` not clearing deferred fields when chaining with `only()`, we will likely need to make changes to the `QuerySet` class in the following file:

- `django/db/models/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `QuerySet.defer()` not clearing deferred fields when chaining with `only()`, we need to modify the `defer` and `only` methods in the `QuerySet` class. Specifically, we need to ensure that `defer` properly clears deferred fields when used in conjunction with `only`.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if fields == (None,):
            clone.query.clear_deferred_loading()
        else:
            clone.query.add_deferred_loading(fields)
        return clone
=======
        if fields == (None,):
            clone.query.clear_deferred_loading()
        else:
            clone.query.add_deferred_loading(fields)
        # Clear any fields that were deferred by only()
        if self.query.deferred_loading[0]:
            clone.query.deferred_loading = (set(), True)
        return clone
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:
                raise ValueError('only() is not supported with FilteredRelation.')
        clone = self._chain()
        clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)
        return clone
=======
        for field in fields:
            field = field.split(LOOKUP_SEP, 1)[0]
            if field in self.query._filtered_relations:
                raise ValueError('only() is not supported with FilteredRelation.')
        clone = self._chain()
        clone.query.add_immediate_loading(fields)
        # Clear any fields that were deferred by defer()
        if self.query.deferred_loading[0]:
            clone.query.deferred_loading = (set(), True)
        return clone
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that when `defer` and `only` are used together, the deferred fields are properly cleared, resulting in the expected SQL queries.
