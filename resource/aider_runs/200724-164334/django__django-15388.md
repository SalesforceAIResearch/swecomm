#### Dev Server fails to restart after adding BASE_DIR to TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS'] in settings  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Repro steps:  
#### $ pip install -U django  
#### $ django-admin startproject <name>  
#### Open settings.py, copy the BASE_DIR variable from line 16 and paste it into the empty DIRS list on line 57  
#### $ ./manage.py runserver  
#### Back in your IDE, save a file and watch the dev server *NOT* restart.  
#### Back in settings.py, remove BASE_DIR from the templates DIRS list. Manually CTRL-C your dev server (as it won't restart on its own when you save), restart the dev server. Now return to your settings.py file, re-save it, and notice the development server once again detects changes and restarts.  
#### This bug prevents the dev server from restarting no matter where you make changes - it is not just scoped to edits to settings.py.

To address the issue with the development server not restarting after adding `BASE_DIR` to `TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']` in `settings.py`, the most likely file that will need changes is:

- `django/utils/autoreload.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue, we need to ensure that the autoreloader correctly watches the `BASE_DIR` directory and its subdirectories. This can be done by modifying the `iter_all_python_module_files` function to include the `BASE_DIR` directory.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Import `settings` from `django.conf`.
2. Add `BASE_DIR` and its subdirectories to the list of watched files.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/utils/autoreload.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from django.utils.version import get_version_tuple
=======
from django.conf import settings
from django.utils.version import get_version_tuple
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/utils/autoreload.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    return iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files))
=======
    base_dir = Path(settings.BASE_DIR)
    extra_files = set(base_dir.rglob('*')) if base_dir.exists() else set()
    return iter_modules_and_files(modules, frozenset(_error_files).union(extra_files))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `BASE_DIR` and its subdirectories are included in the list of watched files, allowing the development server to restart when changes are made.
