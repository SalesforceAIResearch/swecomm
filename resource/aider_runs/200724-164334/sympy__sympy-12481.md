#### `Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles  
#### Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.  
####   
#### This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

To address the issue with the `Permutation` constructor failing with non-disjoint cycles, we will need to modify the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file.

Please add the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the necessary changes to handle non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor:

sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if has_dups(temp):
            if is_cycle:
                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '
                'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))
            else:
                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
        temp = set(temp)
=======
        if is_cycle:
            # Apply cycles in left-to-right order
            c = Cycle()
            for ci in args:
                c = c(*ci)
            aform = c.list()
        else:
            if has_dups(temp):
                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
            temp = set(temp)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that non-disjoint cycles are applied in left-to-right order, resulting in the correct permutation.
