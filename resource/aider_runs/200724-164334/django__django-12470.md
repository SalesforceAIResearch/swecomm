#### Inherited model doesn't correctly order by "-pk" when specified on Parent.Meta.ordering  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Given the following model definition:  
#### from django.db import models  
#### class Parent(models.Model):  
#### 	class Meta:  
#### 		ordering = ["-pk"]  
#### class Child(Parent):  
#### 	pass  
#### Querying the Child class results in the following:  
#### >>> print(Child.objects.all().query)  
#### SELECT "myapp_parent"."id", "myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" FROM "myapp_child" INNER JOIN "myapp_parent" ON ("myapp_child"."parent_ptr_id" = "myapp_parent"."id") ORDER BY "myapp_parent"."id" ASC  
#### The query is ordered ASC but I expect the order to be DESC.

To address the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, the most likely file that will need changes is:

- `django/db/models/query.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with the ordering in the inherited model, we need to ensure that the ordering specified in the `Meta` class of the parent model is correctly applied to the child model. This involves modifying the `QuerySet` class in `django/db/models/query.py`.

Here are the steps to make the necessary changes:

1. Modify the `QuerySet` class to ensure that the ordering specified in the parent model's `Meta` class is correctly applied to the child model.

Let's proceed with the changes:

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        elif self.query.default_ordering and self.query.get_meta().ordering:
            return True
        else:
            return False
=======
        elif self.query.default_ordering:
            ordering = self.query.get_meta().ordering
            if ordering:
                return True
            # Check if the model is inherited and apply parent model's ordering
            for parent in self.model._meta.get_parent_list():
                if parent._meta.ordering:
                    return True
        return False
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that if the model is inherited and the parent model has an ordering specified in its `Meta` class, it will be correctly applied to the child model.
