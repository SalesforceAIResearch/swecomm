#### Messages framework incorrectly serializes/deserializes extra_tags when it's an empty string  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### When a message is serialised and then deserialised with any of the built in storage backends, then extra_tags=="" is converted to extra_tags==None. This is because MessageEncoder checks for the truthyness of extra_tags rather than checking it is not None.  
#### To replicate this bug  
#### >>> from django.conf import settings  
#### >>> settings.configure() # Just to allow the following import  
#### >>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.base import Message  
#### >>> from django.contrib.messages.storage.cookie import MessageEncoder, MessageDecoder  
#### >>> original_message = Message(10, "Here is a message", extra_tags="")  
#### >>> encoded_message = MessageEncoder().encode(original_message)  
#### >>> decoded_message = MessageDecoder().decode(encoded_message)  
#### >>> original_message.extra_tags == ""  
#### True  
#### >>> decoded_message.extra_tags is None  
#### True  
#### Effect of the bug in application behaviour  
#### This error occurred in the wild with a template tag similar to the following:  
#### {% if x not in message.extra_tags %}  
#### When the message was displayed as part of a redirect, it had been serialised and deserialized which meant that extra_tags was None instead of the empty string. This caused an error.  
#### It's important to note that this bug affects all of the standard API (messages.debug, messages.info etc. all have a default value of extra_tags equal to "").

To address the issue with the `extra_tags` being incorrectly serialized/deserialized, we will need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py`
2. `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`

Please add these files to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

To fix the issue with `extra_tags` being incorrectly serialized/deserialized, we need to:

1. Update the `MessageEncoder` class in `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py` to check if `extra_tags` is `None` instead of checking its truthiness.
2. Update the `Message` class in `django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py` to handle the empty string correctly.

Here are the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if obj.extra_tags:
=======
            if obj.extra_tags is not None:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/messages/storage/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.extra_tags = extra_tags
=======
        self.extra_tags = extra_tags if extra_tags is not None else ""
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that `extra_tags` is correctly serialized and deserialized, preserving empty strings as intended.
