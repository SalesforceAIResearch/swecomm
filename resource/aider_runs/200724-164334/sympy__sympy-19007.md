#### Wrong matrix element fetched from BlockMatrix  
#### Given this code:  
#### ```  
#### from sympy import *  
#### n, i = symbols('n, i', integer=True)  
#### A = MatrixSymbol('A', 1, 1)  
#### B = MatrixSymbol('B', n, 1)  
#### C = BlockMatrix([[A], [B]])  
#### print('C is')  
#### pprint(C)  
#### print('C[i, 0] is')  
#### pprint(C[i, 0])  
#### ```  
#### I get this output:  
#### ```  
#### C is  
#### ⎡A⎤  
#### ⎢ ⎥  
#### ⎣B⎦  
#### C[i, 0] is  
#### (A)[i, 0]  
#### ```  
#### `(A)[i, 0]` is the wrong here. `C[i, 0]` should not be simplified as that element may come from either `A` or `B`.

To address the issue with fetching the wrong matrix element from `BlockMatrix`, the most likely file that needs changes is:

- `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with fetching the wrong matrix element from `BlockMatrix`, we need to modify the `_entry` method in `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`. The current implementation simplifies the element access too early, which can lead to incorrect results.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return self.blocks[row_block, col_block][i, j]
=======
        return MatrixSlice(self.blocks[row_block, col_block], (i, i+1), (j, j+1))[0, 0]
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the element access is not simplified prematurely and correctly handles the case where the element may come from different blocks.
