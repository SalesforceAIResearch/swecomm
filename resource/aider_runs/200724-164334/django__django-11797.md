#### Filtering on query result overrides GROUP BY of internal query  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### from django.contrib.auth import models  
#### a = models.User.objects.filter(email__isnull=True).values('email').annotate(m=Max('id')).values('m')  
#### print(a.query) # good

#### print(a[:1].query) # good  
#### # SELECT MAX("auth_user"."id") AS "m" FROM "auth_user" WHERE "auth_user"."email" IS NULL GROUP BY "auth_user"."email" LIMIT 1  
#### b = models.User.objects.filter(id=a[:1])  
#### print(b.query) # GROUP BY U0."id" should be GROUP BY U0."email"

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause being overridden, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/models/query.py`: This file handles the construction of querysets and is likely where the `GROUP BY` clause is being incorrectly overridden.
2. `django/db/models/sql/query.py`: This file deals with the SQL query construction and might need adjustments to ensure the correct `GROUP BY` clause is used.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the `GROUP BY` clause being overridden, we need to ensure that the correct `GROUP BY` clause is used when filtering on a query result. This involves making changes to how the subquery is constructed and ensuring that the `GROUP BY` clause is preserved correctly.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Modify `django/db/models/query.py` to ensure that the correct `GROUP BY` clause is used when filtering on a query result.
2. Modify `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to handle the `GROUP BY` clause correctly in subqueries.

Let's start with the changes to `django/db/models/query.py`:

django/db/models/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (isinstance(self.group_by, tuple) or self.is_sliced or existing_annotations or
                self.distinct or self.combinator):
=======
        if (isinstance(self.group_by, tuple) or self.is_sliced or existing_annotations or
                self.distinct or self.combinator or self.group_by):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to make changes to `django/db/models/sql/query.py`:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (isinstance(self.group_by, tuple) or self.is_sliced or existing_annotations or
                self.distinct or self.combinator):
=======
        if (isinstance(self.group_by, tuple) or self.is_sliced or existing_annotations or
                self.distinct or self.combinator or self.group_by):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the `GROUP BY` clause is preserved correctly when filtering on a query result.

Let's correct the *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for `django/db/models/sql/query.py`:

django/db/models/sql/query.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if (isinstance(self.group_by, tuple) or self.is_sliced or existing_annotations or
                self.distinct or self.combinator or self.group_by):
=======
        if (isinstance(self.group_by, tuple) or self.is_sliced or existing_annotations or
                self.distinct or self.combinator):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
