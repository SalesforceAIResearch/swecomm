#### Added model class to app_list context  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Raffaele Salmaso)  
#### 	   
#### I need to manipulate the app_list in my custom admin view, and the easiest way to get the result is to have access to the model class (currently the dictionary is a serialized model).  
#### In addition I would make the _build_app_dict method public, as it is used by the two views index and app_index.

Here are the changes needed to make the `_build_app_dict` method public and add the model class to the `app_list` context:

1. Rename `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict`.
2. Add the model class to the `app_list` context in the `index` and `app_index` methods.

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _build_app_dict(self, request, label=None):
=======
    def build_app_dict(self, request, label=None):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if app_label in app_dict:
=======
            model_dict['model'] = model  # Add model class to the dictionary

            if app_label in app_dict:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        app_dict = self._build_app_dict(request)
=======
        app_dict = self.build_app_dict(request)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/admin/sites.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        app_dict = self._build_app_dict(request, app_label)
=======
        app_dict = self.build_app_dict(request, app_label)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
