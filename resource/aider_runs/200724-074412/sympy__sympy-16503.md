#### Bad centering for Sum pretty print  
#### ```  
#### >>> pprint(Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3)  
####   ∞  
####  ___  
####  ╲  
####   ╲   x  
####   ╱     + 3  
####  ╱  
####  ‾‾‾  
#### x = 1  
#### ```  
####   
#### The `x` and the `+ 3` should be aligned. I'm not sure if the `x` should be lower of if the `+ 3` should be higher.

To address the issue with the centering of the `Sum` pretty print, the most likely file that needs changes is:

- `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To fix the centering issue with the `Sum` pretty print, we need to adjust the baseline alignment in the `_print_Sum` method. Specifically, we need to ensure that the baseline of the sum symbol aligns correctly with the rest of the expression.

Here are the changes:

sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2
=======
        prettyF.baseline = max_upper + sign_height//2 + 1
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This adjustment should ensure that the `x` and the `+ 3` are aligned correctly.
