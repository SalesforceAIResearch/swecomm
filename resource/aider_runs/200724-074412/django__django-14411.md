#### Label for ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget points to non-labelable element.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by David Sanders)  
#### 	   
#### In the admin, the label element for the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget widget has a 'for' attribute which points to a non-labelable element, since the widget just renders text, not an input. There's no labelable element for the widget, so the label shouldn't have a 'for' attribute.

To address the issue with the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in the admin, we will likely need to edit the following file:

- `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To address the issue with the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in the admin, we need to modify the `get_context` method to ensure that the label does not have a 'for' attribute pointing to a non-labelable element.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/contrib/auth/forms.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        summary = []
=======
        context['widget']['is_hidden'] = True
        context['widget']['attrs']['readonly'] = True
        summary = []
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the widget is marked as hidden and readonly, which should prevent the label from having a 'for' attribute pointing to a non-labelable element.

> Applied edit to django/contrib/auth/forms.py
