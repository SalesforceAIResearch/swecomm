#### Cannot parse Greek characters (and possibly others) in parse_mathematica  
#### The old Mathematica parser `mathematica` in the package `sympy.parsing.mathematica` was able to parse e.g. Greek characters. Hence the following example works fine:  
#### ```  
#### from sympy.parsing.mathematica import mathematica  
#### mathematica('λ')  
#### Out[]:   
#### λ  
#### ```  
####   
#### As of SymPy v. 1.11, the `mathematica` function is deprecated, and is replaced by `parse_mathematica`. This function, however, seems unable to handle the simple example above:  
#### ```  
#### from sympy.parsing.mathematica import parse_mathematica  
#### parse_mathematica('λ')  
#### Traceback (most recent call last):  
#### ...  
#### File "<string>", line unknown  
#### SyntaxError: unable to create a single AST for the expression  
#### ```  
####   
#### This appears to be due to a bug in `parse_mathematica`, which is why I have opened this issue.  
####   
#### Thanks in advance!

To address the issue with `parse_mathematica` not being able to parse Greek characters, we will likely need to make changes to the `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` file.

Please add the `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `parse_mathematica` not being able to parse Greek characters, we need to update the `_literal` regex pattern to include Unicode characters. This will allow the parser to recognize Greek characters and other Unicode symbols.

Here are the changes needed:

1. Update the `_literal` regex pattern to include Unicode characters.
2. Ensure that the tokenizer and other relevant parts of the code can handle these characters.

Let's proceed with the changes:

sympy/parsing/mathematica.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    _literal = r"[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9]*"
=======
    _literal = r"[\w][\w\d]*"
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change updates the `_literal` pattern to use `\w` which matches any Unicode word character, allowing for Greek characters and other Unicode symbols to be parsed correctly.

This should resolve the issue with parsing Greek characters in `parse_mathematica`.
