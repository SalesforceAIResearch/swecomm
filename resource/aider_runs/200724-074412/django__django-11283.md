#### Migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions fails for models recreated as a proxy.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)  
#### 	   
#### I am trying to update my project to Django 2.2. When I launch python manage.py migrate, I get this error message when migration auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions is applying (full stacktrace is available ​here):  
#### django.db.utils.IntegrityError: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "idx_18141_auth_permission_content_type_id_01ab375a_uniq" DETAIL: Key (co.ntent_type_id, codename)=(12, add_agency) already exists.  
#### It looks like the migration is trying to re-create already existing entries in the auth_permission table. At first I though it cloud because we recently renamed a model. But after digging and deleting the entries associated with the renamed model from our database in the auth_permission table, the problem still occurs with other proxy models.  
#### I tried to update directly from 2.0.13 and 2.1.8. The issues appeared each time. I also deleted my venv and recreated it without an effect.  
#### I searched for a ticket about this on the bug tracker but found nothing. I also posted this on ​django-users and was asked to report this here.

To address the issue with the migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions`, we will likely need to modify the migration file itself to handle the existing permissions more gracefully.

Please add the following file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes:

- `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py`

To address the issue with the migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions`, we need to modify the migration file to handle existing permissions more gracefully. Specifically, we should add a check to avoid updating permissions that already exist with the new content type.

Here are the changes:

1. Add a check to see if the permission with the new content type already exists before updating.

django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        Permission.objects.filter(
            permissions_query,
            content_type=old_content_type,
        ).update(content_type=new_content_type)
=======
        existing_permissions = Permission.objects.filter(
            permissions_query,
            content_type=new_content_type,
        ).values_list('codename', flat=True)

        permissions_to_update = Permission.objects.filter(
            permissions_query,
            content_type=old_content_type,
        ).exclude(codename__in=existing_permissions)

        permissions_to_update.update(content_type=new_content_type)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
