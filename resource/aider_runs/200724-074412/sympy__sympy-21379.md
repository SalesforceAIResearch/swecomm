#### Unexpected `PolynomialError` when using simple `subs()` for particular expressions  
#### I am seeing weird behavior with `subs` for particular expressions with hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments. When applying `subs`, I obtain an unexpected `PolynomialError`. For context, I was umbrella-applying a casting from int to float of all int atoms for a bunch of random expressions before using a tensorflow lambdify to avoid potential tensorflow type errors. You can pretend the expression below has a `+ 1` at the end, but below is the MWE that I could produce.  
####   
#### See the expression below, and the conditions in which the exception arises.  
####   
#### Sympy version: 1.8.dev  
####   
#### ```python  
#### from sympy import *  
#### from sympy.core.cache import clear_cache  
####   
#### x, y, z = symbols('x y z')  
####   
#### clear_cache()  
#### expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))  
#### # This works fine  
#### expr.subs({1: 1.0})  
####   
#### clear_cache()  
#### x, y, z = symbols('x y z', real=True)  
#### expr = exp(sinh(Piecewise((x, y > x), (y, True)) / z))  
#### # This fails with "PolynomialError: Piecewise generators do not make sense"  
#### expr.subs({1: 1.0})  # error  
#### # Now run it again (isympy...) w/o clearing cache and everything works as expected without error  
#### expr.subs({1: 1.0})  
#### ```  
####   
#### I am not really sure where the issue is, but I think it has something to do with the order of assumptions in this specific type of expression. Here is what I found-  
####   
#### - The error only (AFAIK) happens with `cosh` or `tanh` in place of `sinh`, otherwise it succeeds  
#### - The error goes away if removing the division by `z`  
#### - The error goes away if removing `exp` (but stays for most unary functions, `sin`, `log`, etc.)  
#### - The error only happens with real symbols for `x` and `y` (`z` does not have to be real)  
####   
#### Not too sure how to debug this one.

To address the issue with the `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` for particular expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `sympy/core/expr.py` - This file contains the `Expr` class, which is the base class for algebraic expressions and includes the `subs` method.
2. `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` - This file contains the definitions for hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`.
3. `sympy/functions/elementary/exponential.py` - This file contains the definition for the `exp` function.
4. `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py` - This file contains the definition for the `Piecewise` function.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue, we need to make sure that the `subs` method handles the `Piecewise` expressions correctly when they are part of hyperbolic functions like `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`. We will make changes to the `subs` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` and ensure that the hyperbolic functions and `Piecewise` handle substitutions correctly.

Let's start by updating the `subs` method in `sympy/core/expr.py` to handle `Piecewise` expressions correctly.

sympy/core/expr.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if isinstance(old, Piecewise):
            return self._subs_piecewise(old, new)
=======
        if isinstance(old, Piecewise):
            return self._subs_piecewise(old, new)
        if isinstance(self, Piecewise):
            return self.func(*[(e._subs(old, new), c._subs(old, new)) for e, c in self.args])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, we need to ensure that the hyperbolic functions handle `Piecewise` expressions correctly. We will update the `eval` methods in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`.

sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if arg.is_Number:
=======
        if isinstance(arg, Piecewise):
            return Piecewise(*[(cls.eval(e), c) for e, c in arg.args])
        elif arg.is_Number:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Finally, we need to ensure that the `Piecewise` function handles substitutions correctly. We will update the `subs` method in `sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py`.

sympy/functions/elementary/piecewise.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return self.func(*[(e._subs(old, new), c._subs(old, new)) for e, c in self.args])
=======
        if isinstance(old, Piecewise):
            return self._subs_piecewise(old, new)
        return self.func(*[(e._subs(old, new), c._subs(old, new)) for e, c in self.args])
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes should address the issue with the `PolynomialError` when using `subs()` for particular expressions involving hyperbolic sinusoids with piecewise arguments.
