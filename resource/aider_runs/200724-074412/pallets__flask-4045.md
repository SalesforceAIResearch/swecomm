#### Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot  
#### This is required since every dot is now significant since blueprints can be nested. An error was already added for endpoint names in 1.0, but should have been added for this as well.

To implement the requested change, we will need to modify the `Blueprint` class in `src/flask/blueprints.py` to raise an error when the blueprint name contains a dot.

Please add the following file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes:
- `src/flask/blueprints.py`

Here are the changes needed to raise an error when the blueprint name contains a dot:

1. Modify the `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class to include a check for dots in the blueprint name and raise a `ValueError` if found.

src/flask/blueprints.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.name = name
=======
        if '.' in name:
            raise ValueError("Blueprint name should not contain dots")
        self.name = name
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that an error is raised if the blueprint name contains a dot, preventing potential issues with nested blueprints.

> Applied edit to src/flask/blueprints.py
