#### delete() on instances of models without any dependencies doesn't clear PKs.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Deleting any model with no dependencies not updates the PK on the model. It should be set to None after .delete() call.  
#### See Django.db.models.deletion:276-281. Should update the model line 280.

To address the issue where deleting a model instance with no dependencies does not clear its primary key, we need to modify the `delete()` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.

Please add the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To ensure that the primary key is set to `None` after deleting instances of models without any dependencies, we need to update the `delete()` method in the `django/db/models/deletion.py` file.

Here are the necessary changes:

django/db/models/deletion.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            if self.can_fast_delete(instance):
                with transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error():
                    count = sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch([instance.pk], self.using)
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}
=======
            if self.can_fast_delete(instance):
                with transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error():
                    count = sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch([instance.pk], self.using)
                setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the primary key is set to `None` after the `delete()` call for models without any dependencies.
