#### Add check for fields of UniqueConstraints.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Marnanel Thurman)  
#### 	   
#### When a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist.  
#### This is in contrast to the older unique_together syntax, which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.  
#### In the attached demonstration, you'll need to uncomment "with_unique_together" in settings.py in order to show that unique_together raises E012.

To add a check for fields of `UniqueConstraints`, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/db/models/base.py` - This file contains the `Model` class, which is responsible for model validation.
2. `django/db/models/options.py` - This file contains the `Options` class, which handles model options including constraints.
3. `django/core/checks/models.py` - This file contains the checks for model fields and constraints.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To add the check for fields of `UniqueConstraints`, we need to:

1. Modify `django/db/models/options.py` to include a method that checks the fields in `UniqueConstraints`.
2. Modify `django/db/models/base.py` to call this new method during model validation.

Here are the necessary changes:

### Step 1: Modify `django/db/models/options.py`

Add a method to check the fields in `UniqueConstraints`.

django/db/models/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return errors
=======
        errors.extend(self._check_unique_constraints())
        return errors

    def _check_unique_constraints(self):
        """Check the fields of UniqueConstraints."""
        from django.core.checks import Error

        errors = []
        for constraint in self.constraints:
            if isinstance(constraint, UniqueConstraint):
                for field_name in constraint.fields:
                    try:
                        self.get_field(field_name)
                    except FieldDoesNotExist:
                        errors.append(
                            Error(
                                "'%s' refers to the nonexistent field '%s'." % (
                                    constraint.name, field_name,
                                ),
                                obj=self.model,
                                id='models.E012',
                            )
                        )
        return errors
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### Step 2: Modify `django/db/models/base.py`

Ensure the new check method is called during model validation.

django/db/models/base.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                *cls._check_constraints(databases),
=======
                *cls._check_constraints(databases),
                *cls._meta._check_unique_constraints(),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `makemigrations` checks that the fields named in `UniqueConstraints` actually exist, similar to the behavior for `unique_together`.
