#### `Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles  
#### Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the identity permutation.  If the cycles passed in are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order and the resulting permutation should be returned.  
####   
#### This should be easy to compute.  I don't see a reason why non-disjoint cycles should be forbidden.

To address the issue with the `Permutation` constructor failing with non-disjoint cycles, we will need to modify the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them in left-to-right order.

The most likely file to need changes is:
- `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To handle non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor, we need to modify the constructor to apply the cycles in left-to-right order. Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if has_dups(temp):
            if is_cycle:
                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '
                'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))
            else:
                raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')
        temp = set(temp)
=======
        if is_cycle:
            # Apply cycles in left-to-right order
            aform = list(range(size or max(temp) + 1))
            for cycle in args:
                for i in range(len(cycle) - 1):
                    aform[cycle[i]], aform[cycle[i + 1]] = aform[cycle[i + 1]], aform[cycle[i]]
            if size and size > len(aform):
                aform.extend(list(range(len(aform), size)))
        else:
            if any(i not in temp for i in range(len(temp))):
                raise ValueError("Integers 0 through %s must be present." % max(temp))
            aform = list(args)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that non-disjoint cycles are applied in left-to-right order, resulting in the correct permutation.
