#### Unexpected exception when multiplying geometry.Point and number

To address the issue with multiplying a `geometry.Point` and a number, the most likely file that needs changes is:

- `sympy/geometry/point.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary modifications.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the `__add__` method in `sympy/geometry/point.py` to handle the case where the other operand is a multiplication involving a `Point` and a scalar. We will also need to modify the `__radd__` method to ensure that the addition is commutative.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/geometry/point.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        try:
            s, o = Point._normalize_dimension(self, Point(other, evaluate=False))
        except TypeError:
            raise GeometryError("Don't know how to add {} and a Point object".format(other))

        coords = [simplify(a + b) for a, b in zip(s, o)]
        return Point(coords, evaluate=False)
=======
        if isinstance(other, Point):
            s, o = Point._normalize_dimension(self, other)
            coords = [simplify(a + b) for a, b in zip(s, o)]
            return Point(coords, evaluate=False)
        elif isinstance(other, (int, float, sympify(0).__class__)):
            return self.__mul__(other)
        elif isinstance(other, Mul) and isinstance(other.args[0], (int, float, sympify(0).__class__)):
            return self.__mul__(other.args[0]) + other.args[1]
        else:
            raise GeometryError("Don't know how to add {} and a Point object".format(other))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/geometry/point.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __radd__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by
        those of other."""
        return self + other
=======
    def __radd__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by
        those of other."""
        return self.__add__(other)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the addition operation works correctly regardless of the order of the operands.

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for the `__radd__` method:

sympy/geometry/point.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __radd__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by
        those of other."""
        return self + other

    def __contains__(self, item):
=======
    def __radd__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by
        those of other."""
        return self.__add__(other)

    def __contains__(self, item):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's try again with a more precise *SEARCH/REPLACE* block for the `__radd__` method:

sympy/geometry/point.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __radd__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by those of other."""
        return self + other

    def __contains__(self, item):
=======
    def __radd__(self, other):
        """Add other to self by incrementing self's coordinates by those of other."""
        return self.__add__(other)

    def __contains__(self, item):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
