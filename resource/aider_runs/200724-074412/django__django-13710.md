#### Use Admin Inline verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Django allows specification of a verbose_name and a verbose_name_plural for Inline classes in admin views. However, verbose_name_plural for an Inline is not currently based on a specified verbose_name. Instead, it continues to be based on the model name, or an a verbose_name specified in the model's Meta class. This was confusing to me initially (I didn't understand why I had to specify both name forms for an Inline if I wanted to overrule the default name), and seems inconsistent with the approach for a model's Meta class (which does automatically base the plural form on a specified verbose_name). I propose that verbose_name_plural for an Inline class should by default be based on the verbose_name for an Inline if that is specified.  
#### I have written a patch to implement this, including tests. Would be happy to submit that.

To implement this change, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `django/contrib/admin/options.py` - This file contains the `InlineModelAdmin` class where we can set the default for `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name`.
2. `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py` - This file will contain the tests to ensure the new behavior works as expected.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Here are the changes needed to implement the requested feature:

1. Modify `InlineModelAdmin` in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` to set `verbose_name_plural` based on `verbose_name` if it is specified.
2. Add tests in `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py` to ensure the new behavior works as expected.

Let's start with the changes to `django/contrib/admin/options.py`:

django/contrib/admin/options.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
=======
        if self.verbose_name_plural is None:
            self.verbose_name_plural = self.verbose_name + 's' if self.verbose_name else self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's add tests to `tests/admin_inlines/tests.py`:

tests/admin_inlines/tests.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def test_both_verbose_names_inline(self):
=======
    def test_inline_verbose_name_plural_default(self):
        class InlineWithVerboseName(TabularInline):
            model = Profile
            verbose_name = 'Custom Verbose Name'

        class InlineWithoutVerboseName(TabularInline):
            model = Profile

        modeladmin = ModelAdmin(ProfileCollection, admin_site)
        modeladmin.inlines = [InlineWithVerboseName, InlineWithoutVerboseName]
        obj = ProfileCollection.objects.create()
        url = reverse('admin:admin_inlines_profilecollection_change', args=(obj.pk,))
        request = self.factory.get(url)
        request.user = self.superuser
        response = modeladmin.changeform_view(request)
        self.assertContains(response, '<h2>Custom Verbose Names</h2>')
        self.assertContains(response, '<h2>Profiles</h2>')

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `verbose_name_plural` for an Inline class is based on `verbose_name` if it is specified, and the tests will verify this behavior.
