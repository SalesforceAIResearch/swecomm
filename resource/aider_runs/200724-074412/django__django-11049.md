#### Correct expected format in invalid DurationField error message  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### If you enter a duration "14:00" into a duration field, it translates to "00:14:00" which is 14 minutes.  
#### The current error message for invalid DurationField says that this should be the format of durations: "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]". But according to the actual behaviour, it should be: "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]", because seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided.  
#### This seems to be a mistake in all Django versions that support the DurationField.  
#### Also the duration fields could have a default help_text with the requested format, because the syntax is not self-explanatory.

To correct the expected format in the invalid `DurationField` error message and add a default `help_text`, we will likely need to edit the following file:

- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks.

Here are the necessary changes to correct the expected format in the invalid `DurationField` error message and add a default `help_text`:

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                     "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu] format."),
=======
                     "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu] format."),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def get_internal_type(self):
=======
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        kwargs.setdefault('help_text', 'Enter a duration in the format [DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]')
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def get_internal_type(self):
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                     "[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu] format.")
=======
                     "[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu] format.")
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

> Applied edit to django/db/models/fields/__init__.py
