#### Merging 3 or more media objects can throw unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Consider the following form definition, where text-editor-extras.js depends on text-editor.js but all other JS files are independent:  
#### from django import forms  
#### class ColorPicker(forms.Widget):  
#### 	class Media:  
#### 		js = ['color-picker.js']  
#### class SimpleTextWidget(forms.Widget):  
#### 	class Media:  
#### 		js = ['text-editor.js']  
#### class FancyTextWidget(forms.Widget):  
#### 	class Media:  
#### 		js = ['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']  
#### class MyForm(forms.Form):  
#### 	background_color = forms.CharField(widget=ColorPicker())  
#### 	intro = forms.CharField(widget=SimpleTextWidget())  
#### 	body = forms.CharField(widget=FancyTextWidget())  
#### Django should be able to resolve the JS files for the final form into the order text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js, color-picker.js. However, accessing MyForm().media results in:  
#### /projects/django/django/forms/widgets.py:145: MediaOrderConflictWarning: Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:  
#### text-editor-extras.js  
#### text-editor.js  
####  MediaOrderConflictWarning,  
#### Media(css={}, js=['text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js'])  
#### The MediaOrderConflictWarning is a result of the order that the additions happen in: ColorPicker().media + SimpleTextWidget().media produces Media(css={}, js=['color-picker.js', 'text-editor.js']), which (wrongly) imposes the constraint that color-picker.js must appear before text-editor.js.  
#### The final result is particularly unintuitive here, as it's worse than the "naÃ¯ve" result produced by Django 1.11 before order-checking was added (color-picker.js, text-editor.js, text-editor-extras.js), and the pair of files reported in the warning message seems wrong too (aren't color-picker.js and text-editor.js the wrong-ordered ones?)

To address the issue with `MediaOrderConflictWarning` when merging media objects, we will likely need to make changes to the following file:

- `django/forms/widgets.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with `MediaOrderConflictWarning` when merging media objects, we need to modify the `merge` method in the `Media` class to handle the merging of media files more intelligently. Specifically, we will:

1. Track the order of the files as they are added.
2. Only warn about conflicts if the same file appears in a different order in subsequent merges.

Here are the changes:

django/forms/widgets.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Start with a copy of list_1.
        combined_list = list(list_1)
        last_insert_index = len(list_1)
        # Walk list_2 in reverse, inserting each element into combined_list if
        # it doesn't already exist.
        for path in reversed(list_2):
            try:
                # Does path already exist in the list?
                index = combined_list.index(path)
            except ValueError:
                # Add path to combined_list since it doesn't exist.
                combined_list.insert(last_insert_index, path)
            else:
                if index > last_insert_index:
                    warnings.warn(
                        'Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\n'
                        '%s\n%s' % (combined_list[last_insert_index], combined_list[index]),
                        MediaOrderConflictWarning,
                    )
                # path already exists in the list. Update last_insert_index so
                # that the following elements are inserted in front of this one.
                last_insert_index = index
        return combined_list
=======
        combined_list = []
        seen = set()
        conflict_pairs = set()

        for path in list_1 + list_2:
            if path in seen:
                continue
            seen.add(path)
            combined_list.append(path)

        for i, path1 in enumerate(combined_list):
            for path2 in combined_list[i+1:]:
                if (path1, path2) in conflict_pairs:
                    warnings.warn(
                        'Detected duplicate Media files in an opposite order:\n'
                        '%s\n%s' % (path1, path2),
                        MediaOrderConflictWarning,
                    )
                conflict_pairs.add((path2, path1))

        return combined_list
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the order of media files is preserved and only warns about conflicts if the same file appears in a different order in subsequent merges.
