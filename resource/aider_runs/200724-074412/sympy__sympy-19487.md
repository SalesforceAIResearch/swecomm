#### Rewrite sign as abs  
#### In sympy the `sign` function is defined as  
#### ```  
####     sign(z)  :=  z / Abs(z)  
#### ```  
#### for all complex non-zero `z`. There should be a way to rewrite the sign in terms of `Abs` e.g.:  
#### ```  
#### >>> sign(x).rewrite(Abs)                                                                                                                     
####  x   
#### ───  
#### │x│  
#### ```  
#### I'm not sure how the possibility of `x` being zero should be handled currently we have  
#### ```  
#### >>> sign(0)                                                                                                                                 
#### 0  
#### >>> 0 / Abs(0)                                                                                                                              
#### nan  
#### ```  
#### Maybe `sign(0)` should be `nan` as well. Otherwise maybe rewrite as Abs would have to be careful about the possibility of the arg being zero (that would make the rewrite fail in most cases).

To implement the requested changes, we will need to modify the `sign` function to include a `rewrite` method that rewrites `sign` in terms of `Abs`. The most likely file to need changes is:

- `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

Here are the changes needed to rewrite the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`:

1. Add the `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method to the `sign` class.
2. Update the `sign` function to handle the case where the argument is zero.

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _eval_simplify(self, **kwargs):
=======
    def _eval_rewrite_as_Abs(self, arg, **kwargs):
        if arg.is_zero:
            return S.NaN
        return arg / Abs(arg)

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        return self
=======
        return S.NaN
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `sign` function can be rewritten in terms of `Abs` and handle the case where the argument is zero by returning `NaN`.
