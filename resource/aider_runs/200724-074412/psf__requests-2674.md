#### urllib3 exceptions passing through requests API  
#### I don't know if it's a design goal of requests to hide urllib3's exceptions and wrap them around requests.exceptions types.  
####   
#### (If it's not IMHO it should be, but that's another discussion)  
####   
#### If it is, I have at least two of them passing through that I have to catch in addition to requests' exceptions. They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)  
####   
#### Thanks!

To address the issue of `urllib3` exceptions passing through the `requests` API, we will need to modify the following files:

1. `requests/exceptions.py` - To define new exceptions that wrap `urllib3` exceptions.
2. `requests/adapters.py` - To catch `urllib3` exceptions and raise the corresponding `requests` exceptions.

Please add the following files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes:

1. `requests/exceptions.py`
2. `requests/adapters.py`

We will make the following changes:

1. **Add new exceptions in `requests/exceptions.py`** to wrap `urllib3` exceptions.
2. **Modify `requests/adapters.py`** to catch `urllib3` exceptions and raise the corresponding `requests` exceptions.

Here are the *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
```
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
=======
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError, DecodeError as BaseDecodeError, TimeoutError as BaseTimeoutError
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
```
class StreamConsumedError(RequestException, TypeError):
    """The content for this response was already consumed"""


class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""
=======
class DecodeError(RequestException, BaseDecodeError):
    """Failed to decode response content"""


class TimeoutError(RequestException, BaseTimeoutError):
    """The request timed out"""
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/adapters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        except (_SSLError, _HTTPError) as e:
=======
        except (_SSLError, _HTTPError, BaseDecodeError, BaseTimeoutError) as e:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/adapters.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            else:
=======
            elif isinstance(e, BaseDecodeError):
                raise DecodeError(e, request=request)
            elif isinstance(e, BaseTimeoutError):
                raise TimeoutError(e, request=request)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that `urllib3` exceptions `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are properly wrapped and raised as `requests` exceptions.

Here are the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* blocks:

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError
=======
from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as BaseHTTPError, DecodeError as BaseDecodeError, TimeoutError as BaseTimeoutError
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

requests/exceptions.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class ContentDecodingError(RequestException, BaseHTTPError):
    """Failed to decode response content"""


class StreamConsumedError(RequestException, TypeError):
    """The content for this response was already consumed"""


class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""
=======

    """Failed to decode response content"""


class DecodeError(RequestException, BaseDecodeError):
    """Failed to decode response content"""
