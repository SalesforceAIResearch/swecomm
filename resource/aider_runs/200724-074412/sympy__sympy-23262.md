#### Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element  
#### Hi,  
####   
#### Thanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:  
####   
####   
#### ```python  
#### import inspect  
#### from sympy import lambdify  
####   
#### inspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))  
#### ```  
#### SymPy 1.9 and under outputs:  
#### ```  
#### 'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1,)\n'  
#### ```  
####   
#### But SymPy 1.10 gives  
####   
#### ```  
#### 'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1)\n'  
#### ```  
#### Note the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple.   
####   
#### For tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:  
#### ```python  
#### inspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))  
#### ```  
#### In SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:  
####   
#### ```  
#### 'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1, 2)\n'  
#### ```  
#### This result is expected.  
####   
#### Not sure if this is a regression. As this breaks my program which assumes the return type to always be a tuple, could you suggest a workaround from the code generation side? Thank you.

To address the issue with the Python code printer not respecting tuples with one element, we will likely need to modify the file responsible for the Python code printer in SymPy. The most probable file that needs changes is:

- `sympy/printing/pycode.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with the Python code printer not respecting tuples with one element, we need to modify the `_print_Tuple` method in the `PythonCodePrinter` class to ensure that a comma is added for single-element tuples.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/printing/pycode.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
class PythonCodePrinter(AbstractPythonCodePrinter):
=======
class PythonCodePrinter(AbstractPythonCodePrinter):

    def _print_Tuple(self, expr):
        if len(expr) == 1:
            return '({},)'.format(self._print(expr[0]))
        return '({})'.format(', '.join(map(self._print, expr)))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that single-element tuples are printed with a trailing comma, maintaining the correct tuple syntax in Python.
