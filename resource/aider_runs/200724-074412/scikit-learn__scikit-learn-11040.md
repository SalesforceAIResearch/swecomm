#### Missing parameter validation in Neighbors estimator for float n_neighbors  
#### ```python  
#### from sklearn.neighbors import NearestNeighbors  
#### from sklearn.datasets import make_blobs  
#### X, y = make_blobs()  
#### neighbors = NearestNeighbors(n_neighbors=3.)  
#### neighbors.fit(X)  
#### neighbors.kneighbors(X)  
#### ```  
#### ```  
#### ~/checkout/scikit-learn/sklearn/neighbors/binary_tree.pxi in sklearn.neighbors.kd_tree.NeighborsHeap.__init__()  
####   
#### TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer  
#### ```  
#### This should be caught earlier and a more helpful error message should be raised (or we could be lenient and cast to integer, but I think a better error might be better).  
####   
#### We need to make sure that   
#### ```python  
#### neighbors.kneighbors(X, n_neighbors=3.)  
#### ```  
#### also works.

To address the issue of missing parameter validation in the Neighbors estimator for float `n_neighbors`, we will need to make changes to the following files:

1. `sklearn/neighbors/_base.py` - This file likely contains the base class for Neighbors estimators where we can add validation for `n_neighbors`.
2. `sklearn/neighbors/_unsupervised.py` - This file likely contains the `NearestNeighbors` class where we can add validation for `n_neighbors` in the `kneighbors` method.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.
