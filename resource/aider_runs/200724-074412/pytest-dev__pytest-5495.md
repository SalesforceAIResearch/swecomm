#### Confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings  
#### The comparison with assertion rewriting for byte strings is confusing:   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"42"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'42'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 52  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'42'  
#### E         ?   ++  
#### ```  
####   
#### 52 is the ASCII ordinal of "4" here.  
####   
#### It became clear to me when using another example:  
####   
#### ```  
####     def test_b():  
#### >       assert b"" == b"1"  
#### E       AssertionError: assert b'' == b'1'  
#### E         Right contains more items, first extra item: 49  
#### E         Full diff:  
#### E         - b''  
#### E         + b'1'  
#### E         ?   +  
#### ```  
####   
#### Not sure what should/could be done here.

To address the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings, we will likely need to modify the following files:

1. `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` - This file handles the assertion rewriting logic and is the most likely place to implement changes to improve the error messages for byte string comparisons.
2. `testing/test_assertrewrite.py` - This file contains tests for the assertion rewriting functionality and will need to be updated to include tests for the new behavior.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the confusing assertion rewriting message with byte strings, we will:

1. Modify the `_format_explanation` function in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` to handle byte strings more clearly.
2. Add tests in `testing/test_assertrewrite.py` to ensure the new behavior is correct.

Here are the changes:

src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def _format_explanation(explanation):
    r"""Format an explanation.

    Return a string with %-placeholders replaced by their values, which
    are %-formatted to escape newlines, and the whole prefixed by a newline.
    """
    if isinstance(explanation, bytes):
        explanation = explanation.decode("utf-8", "replace")
    return "\n" + explanation.replace("\n", "\n~")
=======
def _format_explanation(explanation):
    r"""Format an explanation.

    Return a string with %-placeholders replaced by their values, which
    are %-formatted to escape newlines, and the whole prefixed by a newline.
    """
    if isinstance(explanation, bytes):
        explanation = explanation.decode("utf-8", "replace")
    explanation = explanation.replace("\n", "\n~")
    if isinstance(explanation, str):
        explanation = explanation.replace("b'", "").replace("'", "")
    return "\n" + explanation
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

testing/test_assertrewrite.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def test_boolop(self):
=======
    def test_bytes_comparison(self):
        def f():
            assert b"" == b"42"

        assert getmsg(f) == "assert b'' == b'42'\n  Right contains more items, first extra item: 52\n  Full diff:\n  - b''\n  + b'42'\n  ?   ++"

        def f():
            assert b"" == b"1"

        assert getmsg(f) == "assert b'' == b'1'\n  Right contains more items, first extra item: 49\n  Full diff:\n  - b''\n  + b'1'\n  ?   +"

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will improve the clarity of assertion messages involving byte strings and add tests to ensure the new behavior is correct.
