#### Squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings.  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Squashing migrations with Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes transition should remove deprecation warnings. As far as I'm aware, it's a 4.2 release blocker because you cannot get rid of the index_together deprecation warnings without rewriting migrations, see comment.

To address the deprecation warnings related to `Meta.index_together` and transition to `Meta.indexes`, we will need to edit the migration files that currently use `index_together`.

Please add the migration files that contain `Meta.index_together` to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.
