#### LaTeX printer does not use the same order of monomials as pretty and str   
#### When printing a Poly, the str and pretty printers use the logical order of monomials, from highest to lowest degrees. But latex printer does not.   
#### ```  
#### >>> var('a b c x')  
#### >>> p = Poly([a, 1, b, 2, c, 3], x)  
#### >>> p  
#### Poly(a*x**5 + x**4 + b*x**3 + 2*x**2 + c*x + 3, x, domain='ZZ[a,b,c]')  
#### >>> pretty(p)  
#### "Poly(a*x**5 + x**4 + b*x**3 + 2*x**2 + c*x + 3, x, domain='ZZ[a,b,c]')"  
#### >>> latex(p)  
#### '\\operatorname{Poly}{\\left( a x^{5} + b x^{3} + c x + x^{4} + 2 x^{2} + 3, x, domain=\\mathbb{Z}\\left[a, b, c\\right] \\right)}'  
#### ```

To address the issue with the LaTeX printer not using the same order of monomials as the pretty and str printers, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `sympy/printing/latex.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary changes.

To ensure the LaTeX printer uses the same order of monomials as the pretty and str printers, we need to modify the `_print_Poly` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. Specifically, we will sort the monomials in descending order of their degrees.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/printing/latex.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        expr = self._print(poly.as_expr())
=======
        expr = self._print(poly.as_expr(order='lex'))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the monomials are printed in the correct order.
