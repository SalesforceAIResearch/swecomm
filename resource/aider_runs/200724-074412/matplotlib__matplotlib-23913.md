#### legend draggable as keyword

#### ### Feature request  
####   
#### **There is not keyword to make legend draggable at creation**  
####   
#### <!--A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug-->  
####   
#### Is there a code reason why one can not add a "draggable=True" keyword to the __init__ function for Legend?  This would be more handy than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason why it would not work?

To add a "draggable" keyword to the `__init__` function for the `Legend` class, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `lib/matplotlib/legend.py` - This file will contain the `Legend` class definition where we need to add the `draggable` keyword to the `__init__` method.
2. `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` - This file will likely need changes to pass the `draggable` keyword when creating a legend.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add the "draggable" keyword to the `Legend` class and ensure it is passed correctly when creating a legend, we need to:

1. Modify the `Legend` class in `lib/matplotlib/legend.py` to accept the `draggable` keyword and set the legend to be draggable if specified.
2. Update the `legend` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py` to pass the `draggable` keyword when creating a `Legend`.

Here are the necessary changes:

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        ncol=1  # synonym for ncols (backward compatibility)
=======
        ncol=1,  # synonym for ncols (backward compatibility)
        draggable=False  # make legend draggable if True
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib/matplotlib/legend.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._draggable = None
=======
        self._draggable = None
        if draggable:
            self.set_draggable(True)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.legend_ = mlegend.Legend(self, handles, labels, **kwargs)
=======
        draggable = kwargs.pop('draggable', False)
        self.legend_ = mlegend.Legend(self, handles, labels, draggable=draggable, **kwargs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will add the `draggable` keyword to the `Legend` class and ensure it is passed correctly when creating a legend.
