To implement a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we will likely need to modify the following file:

1. `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` - This file is responsible for parsing command-line arguments and will need to be updated to include the new shortcut.

Please add `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` to the chat so I can proceed with the changes.

To add a one-character shortcut for the `--collect-only` option, we need to modify the `src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py` file to include the new shortcut. Let's use `-c` as the shortcut for `--collect-only`.

Here are the changes:

src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self._anonymous.addoption(*opts, **attrs)
=======
        # Adding a shortcut for --collect-only
        if '--collect-only' in opts:
            opts = opts + ('-c',)
        self._anonymous.addoption(*opts, **attrs)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change will add `-c` as a shortcut for `--collect-only`.

> Applied edit to src/_pytest/config/argparsing.py
