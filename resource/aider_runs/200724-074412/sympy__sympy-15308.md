#### LaTeX printing for Matrix Expression  
#### ```py  
#### >>> A = MatrixSymbol("A", n, n)  
#### >>> latex(trace(A**2))  
#### 'Trace(A**2)'  
#### ```  
####   
#### The bad part is not only is Trace not recognized, but whatever printer is being used doesn't fallback to the LaTeX printer for the inner expression (it should be `A^2`).

To address the issue with LaTeX printing for `MatrixExpression` and ensure that `Trace` is recognized and the inner expression falls back to the LaTeX printer, we will likely need to edit the following files:

1. `sympy/printing/latex.py` - This file contains the `LatexPrinter` class, which is responsible for converting expressions to LaTeX format. We will need to add or modify the `_print_Trace` method to handle `Trace` objects correctly.

Please add `sympy/printing/latex.py` to the chat so we can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the issue with LaTeX printing for `MatrixExpression` and ensure that `Trace` is recognized and the inner expression falls back to the LaTeX printer, we will add a `_print_Trace` method to the `LatexPrinter` class in `sympy/printing/latex.py`.

Here are the necessary changes:

sympy/printing/latex.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def _print_MatAdd(self, expr):
=======
    def _print_Trace(self, expr):
        arg = self._print(expr.arg)
        return r"\operatorname{tr}\left(%s\right)" % arg

>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This will ensure that the `Trace` function is recognized and properly formatted in LaTeX. The inner expression will be handled by the existing `_print` method, ensuring it falls back to the LaTeX printer for the inner expression.

> Applied edit to sympy/printing/latex.py
