To fix the "string index out of range" error in `numberformat.py`, we will need to edit the following file:

- `django/utils/numberformat.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can provide the necessary *SEARCH/REPLACE* block.

To fix the "string index out of range" error when `str_number` is empty, we need to add a check to ensure `str_number` is not empty before accessing its first character. Here is the necessary change:

django/utils/numberformat.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if str_number[0] == "-":
=======
    if str_number and str_number[0] == "-":
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

This change ensures that the code only attempts to access the first character of `str_number` if it is not empty, thus preventing the `IndexError`.
