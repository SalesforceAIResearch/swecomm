#### v3.3 upgrade started generating "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" warnings  
#### We've updated to Sphinx 3.3 in our documentation, and suddenly the following warning started popping up in our builds when we build either `singlehtml` or `latex`.:  
####   
#### `WARNING: no number is assigned for table:`  
####   
#### I looked through the changelog but it didn't seem like there was anything related to `numref` that was changed, but perhaps I missed something? Could anyone point me to a change in the numref logic so I can figure out where these warnings are coming from?

To address the "WARNING: no number is assigned for table" issue, we will likely need to investigate and potentially modify the following files:

1. `sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py` - This file handles the LaTeX builder, which is directly related to the warning you are seeing.
2. `sphinx/builders/singlehtml.py` - This file handles the SingleFileHTMLBuilder, which is also related to the warning.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To address the warning "no number is assigned for table," we need to ensure that the numbering for tables is correctly handled in both the LaTeX and SingleHTML builders. 

We will:
1. Update the `assemble_doctree` method in both `sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py` and `sphinx/builders/singlehtml.py` to ensure that table numbers are correctly assigned.

Here are the changes:

sphinx/builders/latex/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.env.resolve_references(largetree, indexfile, self)
=======
        self.env.resolve_references(largetree, indexfile, self)
        self.env.assign_section_numbers(largetree)
        self.env.assign_figure_numbers(largetree)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sphinx/builders/singlehtml.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        self.fix_refuris(tree)
=======
        self.fix_refuris(tree)
        self.env.assign_section_numbers(tree)
        self.env.assign_figure_numbers(tree)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that section and figure numbers, including table numbers, are assigned correctly, which should resolve the warnings you are seeing.
