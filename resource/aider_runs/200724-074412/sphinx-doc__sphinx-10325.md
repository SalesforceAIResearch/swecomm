#### inherited-members should support more than one class  
#### **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**  
#### I have two situations:  
#### - A class inherits from multiple other classes. I want to document members from some of the base classes but ignore some of the base classes  
#### - A module contains several class definitions that inherit from different classes that should all be ignored (e.g., classes that inherit from list or set or tuple). I want to ignore members from list, set, and tuple while documenting all other inherited members in classes in the module.  
####   
#### **Describe the solution you'd like**  
#### The :inherited-members: option to automodule should accept a list of classes. If any of these classes are encountered as base classes when instantiating autoclass documentation, they should be ignored.  
####   
#### **Describe alternatives you've considered**  
#### The alternative is to not use automodule, but instead manually enumerate several autoclass blocks for a module. This only addresses the second bullet in the problem description and not the first. It is also tedious for modules containing many class definitions.  
####

To implement the feature where `:inherited-members:` accepts a list of classes, the most likely files that will need changes are:

1. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` - This file likely contains the logic for handling the `:inherited-members:` option.
2. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py` - This file likely contains the directive definitions and might need updates to parse the new format for `:inherited-members:`.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

To implement the feature where `:inherited-members:` accepts a list of classes, we need to:

1. Update the `inherited_members_option` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to handle a list of classes.
2. Modify the `filter_members` method in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to check against the list of classes.
3. Update the `process_documenter_options` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py` to handle the new format for `:inherited-members:`.

Here are the necessary changes:

### 1. Update `inherited_members_option` function

sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def inherited_members_option(arg: Any) -> Union[object, Set[str]]:
    """Used to convert the :members: option to auto directives."""
    if arg in (None, True):
        return 'object'
    else:
        return arg
=======
def inherited_members_option(arg: Any) -> Union[object, Set[str]]:
    """Used to convert the :inherited-members: option to auto directives."""
    if arg in (None, True):
        return {'object'}
    elif isinstance(arg, str):
        return {x.strip() for x in arg.split(',') if x.strip()}
    else:
        raise ValueError(__('invalid value for inherited-members option: %s') % arg)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 2. Modify `filter_members` method

sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                    if cls.__name__ == self.options.inherited_members and cls != self.object:
=======
                    if cls.__name__ in self.options.inherited_members and cls != self.object:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

### 3. Update `process_documenter_options` function

sphinx/ext/autodoc/directive.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
def process_documenter_options(documenter: Type[Documenter], config: Config, options: Dict
                               ) -> Options:
=======
def process_documenter_options(documenter: Type[Documenter], config: Config, options: Dict) -> Options:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    for name in AUTODOC_DEFAULT_OPTIONS:
=======
    for name in AUTODOC_DEFAULT_OPTIONS + ['inherited-members']:
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Please review these changes and let me know if you need any further modifications.
