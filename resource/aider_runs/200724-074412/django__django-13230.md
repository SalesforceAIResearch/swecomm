#### Add support for item_comments to syndication framework  
#### Description  
#### 	  
#### Add comments argument to feed.add_item() in syndication.views so that item_comments can be defined directly without having to take the detour via item_extra_kwargs .  
#### Additionally, comments is already explicitly mentioned in the feedparser, but not implemented in the view.

To add support for `item_comments` to the syndication framework, we will likely need to edit the following files:

1. `django/contrib/syndication/views.py` - This file will need changes to the `add_item` method to accept and handle the `comments` argument.
2. `django/contrib/syndication/feeds.py` - This file will need changes to include the `comments` field in the feed generation.

Please add these files to the chat so I can proceed with the necessary changes.

Here are the changes needed to add support for `item_comments` in the syndication framework:

1. Add a method to get `item_comments`.
2. Update the `feed.add_item` call to include the `comments` argument.

django/contrib/syndication/views.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
            feed.add_item(
=======
            comments = self._get_dynamic_attr('item_comments', item)
            feed.add_item(
                comments=comments,
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

django/contrib/syndication/views.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
                **self.item_extra_kwargs(item)
=======
                **self.item_extra_kwargs(item),
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Now, the `item_comments` can be defined directly without having to take the detour via `item_extra_kwargs`.
