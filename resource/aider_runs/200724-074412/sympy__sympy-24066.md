#### SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() cannot properly detect that exponent is dimensionless  
#### How to reproduce:  
####   
#### ```python  
#### from sympy import exp  
#### from sympy.physics import units  
#### from sympy.physics.units.systems.si import SI  
####   
#### expr = units.second / (units.ohm * units.farad)  
#### dim = SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(expr)[1]  
####   
#### assert SI.get_dimension_system().is_dimensionless(dim)  
####   
#### buggy_expr = 100 + exp(expr)  
#### SI._collect_factor_and_dimension(buggy_expr)  
####   
#### # results in ValueError: Dimension of "exp(second/(farad*ohm))" is Dimension(time/(capacitance*impedance)), but it should be Dimension(1)  
#### ```

To address the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` not properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless, we will likely need to modify the following file:

- `sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py`

Please add this file to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To fix the issue with `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` not properly detecting that the exponent is dimensionless, we need to modify the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in `sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py`. Specifically, we need to ensure that the method correctly identifies dimensionless quantities.

Here are the changes:

1. Modify the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to handle dimensionless exponents properly.

sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
from sympy.physics.units import DimensionSystem, Dimension, dHg0
=======
from sympy.physics.units import DimensionSystem, Dimension, dHg0, Dimensionless
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        if dim != Dimension(1):
            raise ValueError(f'Dimension of "{expr}" is {dim}, but it should be Dimension(1)')
=======
        if dim != Dimension(1) and not DimensionSystem.equivalent_dims(dim, Dimensionless):
            raise ValueError(f'Dimension of "{expr}" is {dim}, but it should be Dimension(1) or Dimensionless')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes will ensure that the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method correctly identifies dimensionless quantities and avoids raising a `ValueError` when the exponent is dimensionless.

Let's correct the failed *SEARCH/REPLACE* block by ensuring we match the exact lines in the file.

sympy/physics/units/systems/si.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    if dim != Dimension(1):
        raise ValueError(f'Dimension of "{expr}" is {dim}, but it should be Dimension(1)')
=======
    if dim != Dimension(1) and not DimensionSystem.equivalent_dims(dim, Dimensionless):
        raise ValueError(f'Dimension of "{expr}" is {dim}, but it should be Dimension(1) or Dimensionless')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Let's ensure we match the exact lines in the file. Here is the corrected *SEARCH/REPLACE* block:

```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH

                raise ValueError(f'Dimension of "{expr}" is {dim}, but it should be Dimension(1)')
=======
            if dim != Dimension(1) and not DimensionSystem.equivalent_dims(dim, Dimensionless):
                raise ValueError(f'Dimension of "{expr}" is {dim}, but it should be Dimension(1) or Dimensionless')
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```
