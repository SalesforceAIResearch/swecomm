#### Saving parent object after setting on child leads to data loss for parents with non-numeric primary key.  
#### Description  
#### 	   
#### 		(last modified by Charlie DeTar)  
#### 	   
#### Given a model with a foreign key relation to another model that has a non-auto CharField as its primary key:  
#### class Product(models.Model):  
#### 	sku = models.CharField(primary_key=True, max_length=50)  
#### class Order(models.Model):  
#### 	product = models.ForeignKey(Product, on_delete=models.CASCADE)  
#### If the relation is initialized on the parent with an empty instance that does not yet specify its primary key, and the primary key is subsequently defined, the parent does not "see" the primary key's change:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product()  
#### 	order.product.sku = "foo"  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product_id="").exists() # Succeeds, but shouldn't  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # Fails  
#### Instead of product_id being populated with product.sku, it is set to emptystring. The foreign key constraint which would enforce the existence of a product with sku="" is deferred until the transaction commits. The transaction does correctly fail on commit with a ForeignKeyViolation due to the non-existence of a product with emptystring as its primary key.  
#### On the other hand, if the related unsaved instance is initialized with its primary key before assignment to the parent, it is persisted correctly:  
#### with transaction.atomic():  
#### 	order = Order()  
#### 	order.product = Product(sku="foo")  
#### 	order.product.save()  
#### 	order.save()  
#### 	assert Order.objects.filter(product=order.product).exists() # succeeds  
#### Committing the transaction also succeeds.  
#### This may have something to do with how the Order.product_id field is handled at assignment, together with something about handling fetching of auto vs non-auto primary keys from the related instance.

To address the issue described, we will likely need to make changes to the following files:

1. `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` - This file handles the assignment of related objects to fields, which is where the issue with the primary key not being updated might be occurring.
2. `django/db/models/fields/related.py` - This file defines the ForeignKey field and might need adjustments to ensure the primary key is correctly set on assignment.

Please add these files to the chat so I can propose the necessary changes.

To address the issue, we need to ensure that the primary key of the related object is correctly set before saving the parent object. This involves modifying the `__set__` method in the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` class in `related_descriptors.py` and potentially the `ForeignKey` class in `related.py`.

Let's start with the changes in `related_descriptors.py`:

1. Modify the `__set__` method in the `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` class to ensure the primary key is set before saving the parent object.

django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
        # Set the values of the related field.
        else:
            for lh_field, rh_field in self.field.related_fields:
                setattr(instance, lh_field.attname, getattr(value, rh_field.attname))
=======
        # Ensure the primary key is set before saving the parent object.
        else:
            if value._state.adding and value._meta.pk.attname in value.__dict__:
                value.save()
            for lh_field, rh_field in self.field.related_fields:
                setattr(instance, lh_field.attname, getattr(value, rh_field.attname))
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

Next, let's ensure that the `ForeignKey` class in `related.py` correctly handles the primary key assignment:

django/db/models/fields/related.py
```python
<<<<<<< SEARCH
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        super().__set__(instance, value)
        # If the primary key is a link to a parent model and a parent instance
        # is being set, update the value of the inherited pk(s).
        if self.field.primary_key and self.field.remote_field.parent_link:
            opts = instance._meta
            # Inherited primary key fields from this object's base classes.
            inherited_pk_fields = [
                field for field in opts.concrete_fields
                if field.primary_key and field.remote_field
            ]
            for field in inherited_pk_fields:
                rel_model_pk_name = field.remote_field.model._meta.pk.attname
                raw_value = getattr(value, rel_model_pk_name) if value is not None else None
                setattr(instance, rel_model_pk_name, raw_value)
=======
    def __set__(self, instance, value):
        if value is not None and value._state.adding and value._meta.pk.attname in value.__dict__:
            value.save()
        super().__set__(instance, value)
        # If the primary key is a link to a parent model and a parent instance
        # is being set, update the value of the inherited pk(s).
        if self.field.primary_key and self.field.remote_field.parent_link:
            opts = instance._meta
            # Inherited primary key fields from this object's base classes.
            inherited_pk_fields = [
                field for field in opts.concrete_fields
                if field.primary_key and field.remote_field
            ]
            for field in inherited_pk_fields:
                rel_model_pk_name = field.remote_field.model._meta.pk.attname
                raw_value = getattr(value, rel_model_pk_name) if value is not None else None
                setattr(instance, rel_model_pk_name, raw_value)
>>>>>>> REPLACE
```

These changes ensure that the primary key of the related object is set before saving the parent object, preventing data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys.
