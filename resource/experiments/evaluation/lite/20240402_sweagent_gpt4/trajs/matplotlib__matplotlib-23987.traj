All axes decorations are dealt with (labels, ticks, titles,\n4:ticklabels) and some dependent artists are also dealt with (colorbar,\n5:suptitle).\n6:\n7:Layout is done via `~matplotlib.gridspec`, with one constraint per gridspec,\n8:so it is possible to have overlapping axes if the gridspecs overlap (i.e.\n9:using `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`).  Axes placed using\n10:``figure.subplots()`` or ``figure.add_subplots()`` will participate in the\n11:layout.  Axes manually placed via ``figure.add_axes()`` will not.\n12:\n13:See Tutorial: :doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide`\n14:\n15:General idea:\n16:-------------\n17:\n18:First, a figure has a gridspec that divides the figure into nrows and ncols,\n19:with heights and widths set by ``height_ratios`` and ``width_ratios``,\n20:often just set to 1 for an equal grid.\n21:\n22:Subplotspecs that are derived from this gridspec can contain either a\n23:``SubPanel``, a ``GridSpecFromSubplotSpec``, or an ``Axes``.  The ``SubPanel``\n24:and ``GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`` are dealt with recursively and each contain an\n25:analogous layout.\n26:\n27:Each ``GridSpec`` has a ``_layoutgrid`` attached to it.  The ``_layoutgrid``\n28:has the same logical layout as the ``GridSpec``.   Each row of the grid spec\n29:has a top and bottom \"margin\" and each column has a left and right \"margin\".\n30:The \"inner\" height of each row is constrained to be the same (or as modified\n31:by ``height_ratio``), and the \"inner\" width of each column is\n32:constrained to be the same (as modified by ``width_ratio``), where \"inner\"\n33:is the width or height of each column/row minus the size of the margins.\n34:\n35:Then the size of the margins for each row and column are determined as the\n36:max width of the decorators on each axes that has decorators in that margin.\n37:For instance, a normal axes would have a left margin that includes the\n38:left ticklabels, and the ylabel if it exists.  The right margin may include a\n39:colorbar, the bottom margin the xaxis decorations, and the top margin the\n40:title.\n41:\n42:With these constraints, the solver then finds appropriate bounds for the\n43:columns and rows.  It's possible that the margins take up the whole figure,\n44:in which case the algorithm is not applied and a warning is raised.\n45:\n46:See the tutorial doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide`\n47:for more discussion of the algorithm with examples.\n48:\"\"\"\n49:\n50:import logging\n51:\n52:import numpy as np\n53:\n54:from matplotlib import _api, artist as martist\n55:import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms\n56:import matplotlib._layoutgrid as mlayoutgrid\n57:\n58:\n59:_log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n60:\n61:\n62:######################################################\n63:def do_constrained_layout(fig, h_pad, w_pad,\n64:                          hspace=None, wspace=None, rect=(0, 0, 1, 1),\n65:                          compress=False):\n66:    \"\"\"\n67:    Do the constrained_layout.

All axes decorations are dealt with (labels, ticks, titles,\n4:ticklabels) and some dependent artists are also dealt with (colorbar,\n5:suptitle).\n6:\n7:Layout is done via `~matplotlib.gridspec`, with one constraint per gridspec,\n8:so it is possible to have overlapping axes if the gridspecs overlap (i.e.\n9:using `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`).  Axes placed using\n10:``figure.subplots()`` or ``figure.add_subplots()`` will participate in the\n11:layout.

The ``SubPanel``\n24:and ``GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`` are dealt with recursively and each contain an\n25:analogous layout.\n26:\n27:Each ``GridSpec`` has a ``_layoutgrid`` attached to it.  The ``_layoutgrid``\n28:has the same logical layout as the ``GridSpec``.   Each row of the grid spec\n29:has a top and bottom \"margin\" and each column has a left and right \"margin\".\n30:The \"inner\" height of each row is constrained to be the same (or as modified\n31:by ``height_ratio``), and the \"inner\" width of each column is\n32:constrained to be the same (as modified by ``width_ratio``), where \"inner\"\n33:is the width or height of each column/row minus the size of the margins.\n34:\n35:Then the size of the margins for each row and column are determined as the\n36:max width of the decorators on each axes that has decorators in that margin.\n37:For instance, a normal axes would have a left margin that includes the\n38:left ticklabels, and the ylabel if it exists.  The right margin may include a\n39:colorbar, the bottom margin the xaxis decorations, and the top margin the\n40:title.\n41:\n42:With these constraints, the solver then finds appropriate bounds for the\n43:columns and rows.

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's first start by reproducing the results of the issue. The issue includes some example code for reproduction, which we can use. We'll create a new file called `reproduce.py` and paste the example code into it.\n```\ncreate reproduce.py\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (1 lines total)]\n1:\n\n(Open file: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nNow let's paste in the example code from the issue.\n```\nedit 1:1\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nend_of_edit\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (9 lines total)]\n1:from marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\n2:from datetime import timedelta\n3:\n4:td_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n5:\n6:obj = dict()\n7:obj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n8:\n9:print(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nFile updated.

The issue suggests that there is a rounding problem near line 1474. The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475.To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int.

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[Bug]: Constrained layout UserWarning even when False\n### Bug summary\r\n\r\nWhen using layout settings such as `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight`, a UserWarning is produced due to incompatibility with constrained_layout, even if constrained_layout = False. This was not the case in previous versions.\r\n\r\n### Code for reproduction\r\n\r\n```python\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nimport numpy as np\r\na = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)\r\nb = np.sin(a)\r\nc = np.cos(a)\r\nfig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,2),constrained_layout=False)\r\nax[0].plot(a,b)\r\nax[1].plot(a,c)\r\nplt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual outcome\r\n\r\nThe plot works fine but the warning is generated\r\n\r\n`/var/folders/ss/pfgdfm2x7_s4cyw2v0b_t7q80000gn/T/ipykernel_76923/4170965423.py:7: UserWarning: This figure was using a layout engine that is incompatible with subplots_adjust and/or tight_layout; not calling subplots_adjust.\r\n  plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)`\r\n\r\n### Expected outcome\r\n\r\nno warning\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWarning disappears when constrained_layout=False is removed\r\n\r\n### Operating system\r\n\r\nOS/X\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Version\r\n\r\n3.6.0\r\n\r\n### Matplotlib Backend\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Python version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Jupyter version\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nconda\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /matplotlib__matplotlib)\nbash-$",

All axes decorations are dealt with (labels, ticks, titles,\n4:ticklabels) and some dependent artists are also dealt with (colorbar,\n5:suptitle).\n6:\n7:Layout is done via `~matplotlib.gridspec`, with one constraint per gridspec,\n8:so it is possible to have overlapping axes if the gridspecs overlap (i.e.\n9:using `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`).  Axes placed using\n10:``figure.subplots()`` or ``figure.add_subplots()`` will participate in the\n11:layout.  Axes manually placed via ``figure.add_axes()`` will not.\n12:\n13:See Tutorial: :doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide`\n14:\n15:General idea:\n16:-------------\n17:\n18:First, a figure has a gridspec that divides the figure into nrows and ncols,\n19:with heights and widths set by ``height_ratios`` and ``width_ratios``,\n20:often just set to 1 for an equal grid.\n21:\n22:Subplotspecs that are derived from this gridspec can contain either a\n23:``SubPanel``, a ``GridSpecFromSubplotSpec``, or an ``Axes``.  The ``SubPanel``\n24:and ``GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`` are dealt with recursively and each contain an\n25:analogous layout.\n26:\n27:Each ``GridSpec`` has a ``_layoutgrid`` attached to it.  The ``_layoutgrid``\n28:has the same logical layout as the ``GridSpec``.   Each row of the grid spec\n29:has a top and bottom \"margin\" and each column has a left and right \"margin\".\n30:The \"inner\" height of each row is constrained to be the same (or as modified\n31:by ``height_ratio``), and the \"inner\" width of each column is\n32:constrained to be the same (as modified by ``width_ratio``), where \"inner\"\n33:is the width or height of each column/row minus the size of the margins.\n34:\n35:Then the size of the margins for each row and column are determined as the\n36:max width of the decorators on each axes that has decorators in that margin.\n37:For instance, a normal axes would have a left margin that includes the\n38:left ticklabels, and the ylabel if it exists.  The right margin may include a\n39:colorbar, the bottom margin the xaxis decorations, and the top margin the\n40:title.\n41:\n42:With these constraints, the solver then finds appropriate bounds for the\n43:columns and rows.  It's possible that the margins take up the whole figure,\n44:in which case the algorithm is not applied and a warning is raised.\n45:\n46:See the tutorial doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide`\n47:for more discussion of the algorithm with examples.\n48:\"\"\"\n49:\n50:import logging\n51:\n52:import numpy as np\n53:\n54:from matplotlib import _api, artist as martist\n55:import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms\n56:import matplotlib._layoutgrid as mlayoutgrid\n57:\n58:\n59:_log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n60:\n61:\n62:######################################################\n63:def do_constrained_layout(fig, h_pad, w_pad,\n64:                          hspace=None, wspace=None, rect=(0, 0, 1, 1),\n65:                          compress=False):\n66:    \"\"\"\n67:    Do the constrained_layout.

All axes decorations are dealt with (labels, ticks, titles,\n4:ticklabels) and some dependent artists are also dealt with (colorbar,\n5:suptitle).\n6:\n7:Layout is done via `~matplotlib.gridspec`, with one constraint per gridspec,\n8:so it is possible to have overlapping axes if the gridspecs overlap (i.e.\n9:using `~matplotlib.gridspec.GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`).  Axes placed using\n10:``figure.subplots()`` or ``figure.add_subplots()`` will participate in the\n11:layout.  Axes manually placed via ``figure.add_axes()`` will not.\n12:\n13:See Tutorial: :doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide`\n14:\n15:General idea:\n16:-------------\n17:\n18:First, a figure has a gridspec that divides the figure into nrows and ncols,\n19:with heights and widths set by ``height_ratios`` and ``width_ratios``,\n20:often just set to 1 for an equal grid.\n21:\n22:Subplotspecs that are derived from this gridspec can contain either a\n23:``SubPanel``, a ``GridSpecFromSubplotSpec``, or an ``Axes``.  The ``SubPanel``\n24:and ``GridSpecFromSubplotSpec`` are dealt with recursively and each contain an\n25:analogous layout.\n26:\n27:Each ``GridSpec`` has a ``_layoutgrid`` attached to it.  The ``_layoutgrid``\n28:has the same logical layout as the ``GridSpec``.   Each row of the grid spec\n29:has a top and bottom \"margin\" and each column has a left and right \"margin\".\n30:The \"inner\" height of each row is constrained to be the same (or as modified\n31:by ``height_ratio``), and the \"inner\" width of each column is\n32:constrained to be the same (as modified by ``width_ratio``), where \"inner\"\n33:is the width or height of each column/row minus the size of the margins.\n34:\n35:Then the size of the margins for each row and column are determined as the\n36:max width of the decorators on each axes that has decorators in that margin.\n37:For instance, a normal axes would have a left margin that includes the\n38:left ticklabels, and the ylabel if it exists.  The right margin may include a\n39:colorbar, the bottom margin the xaxis decorations, and the top margin the\n40:title.\n41:\n42:With these constraints, the solver then finds appropriate bounds for the\n43:columns and rows.  It's possible that the margins take up the whole figure,\n44:in which case the algorithm is not applied and a warning is raised.\n45:\n46:See the tutorial doc:`/tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide`\n47:for more discussion of the algorithm with examples.\n48:\"\"\"\n49:\n50:import logging\n51:\n52:import numpy as np\n53:\n54:from matplotlib import _api, artist as martist\n55:import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms\n56:import matplotlib._layoutgrid as mlayoutgrid\n57:\n58:\n59:_log = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n60:\n61:\n62:######################################################\n63:def do_constrained_layout(fig, h_pad, w_pad,\n64:                          hspace=None, wspace=None, rect=(0, 0, 1, 1),\n65:                          compress=False):\n66:    \"\"\"\n67:    Do the constrained_layout.
