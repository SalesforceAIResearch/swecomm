Two important\n13:distinctions must be made:\n14:\n15::outlier detection:\n16:  The training data contains outliers which are defined as observations that\n17:  are far from the others. Outlier detection estimators thus try to fit the\n18:  regions where the training data is the most concentrated, ignoring the\n19:  deviant observations.\n20:\n21::novelty detection:\n22:  The training data is not polluted by outliers and we are interested in\n23:  detecting whether a **new** observation is an outlier. In this context an\n24:  outlier is also called a novelty.\n25:\n26:Outlier detection and novelty detection are both used for anomaly\n27:detection, where one is interested in detecting abnormal or unusual\n28:observations. Outlier detection is then also known as unsupervised anomaly\n29:detection and novelty detection as semi-supervised anomaly detection. In the\n30:context of outlier detection, the outliers/anomalies cannot form a\n31:dense cluster as available estimators assume that the outliers/anomalies are\n32:located in low density regions.

This is the question addressed by the novelty detection\n133:tools and methods.\n134:\n135:In general, it is about to learn a rough, close frontier delimiting\n136:the contour of the initial observations distribution, plotted in\n137:embedding :math:`p`-dimensional space.

Otherwise, if they lay outside the frontier, we can say\n141:that they are abnormal with a given confidence in our assessment.\n142:\n143:The One-Class SVM has been introduced by Sch\u00f6lkopf et al. for that purpose\n144:and implemented in the :ref:`svm` module in the\n145::class:`svm.OneClassSVM` object.

Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code!

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's first start by reproducing the results of the issue. The issue includes some example code for reproduction, which we can use. We'll create a new file called `reproduce.py` and paste the example code into it.\n```\ncreate reproduce.py\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (1 lines total)]\n1:\n\n(Open file: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nNow let's paste in the example code from the issue.\n```\nedit 1:1\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nend_of_edit\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (9 lines total)]\n1:from marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\n2:from datetime import timedelta\n3:\n4:td_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n5:\n6:obj = dict()\n7:obj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n8:\n9:print(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nFile updated.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nExpose warm_start in Isolation forest\nIt seems to me that `sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest` supports incremental addition of new trees with the `warm_start` parameter of its parent class, `sklearn.ensemble.BaseBagging`.\r\n\r\nEven though this parameter is not exposed in `__init__()` , it gets inherited from `BaseBagging` and one can use it by changing it to `True` after initialization. To make it work, you have to also increment `n_estimators` on every iteration. \r\n\r\nIt took me a while to notice that it actually works, and I had to inspect the source code of both `IsolationForest` and `BaseBagging`. Also, it looks to me that the behavior is in-line with `sklearn.ensemble.BaseForest` that is behind e.g. `sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier`.\r\n\r\nTo make it more easier to use, I'd suggest to:\r\n* expose `warm_start` in `IsolationForest.__init__()`, default `False`;\r\n* document it in the same way as it is documented for `RandomForestClassifier`, i.e. say:\r\n```py\r\n    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)\r\n        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit\r\n        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole\r\n        new forest. See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.\r\n```\r\n* add a test to make sure it works properly;\r\n* possibly also mention in the \"IsolationForest example\" documentation entry;\r\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$",

Two important\n13:distinctions must be made:\n14:\n15::outlier detection:\n16:  The training data contains outliers which are defined as observations that\n17:  are far from the others. Outlier detection estimators thus try to fit the\n18:  regions where the training data is the most concentrated, ignoring the\n19:  deviant observations.\n20:\n21::novelty detection:\n22:  The training data is not polluted by outliers and we are interested in\n23:  detecting whether a **new** observation is an outlier. In this context an\n24:  outlier is also called a novelty.\n25:\n26:Outlier detection and novelty detection are both used for anomaly\n27:detection, where one is interested in detecting abnormal or unusual\n28:observations. Outlier detection is then also known as unsupervised anomaly\n29:detection and novelty detection as semi-supervised anomaly detection. In the\n30:context of outlier detection, the outliers/anomalies cannot form a\n31:dense cluster as available estimators assume that the outliers/anomalies are\n32:located in low density regions. On the contrary, in the context of novelty\n33:detection, novelties/anomalies can form a dense cluster as long as they are in\n34:a low density region of the training data, considered as normal in this\n35:context.\n36:\n37:The scikit-learn project provides a set of machine learning tools that\n38:can be used both for novelty or outlier detection. This strategy is\n39:implemented with objects learning in an unsupervised way from the data::\n40:\n41:    estimator.fit(X_train)\n42:\n43:new observations can then be sorted as inliers or outliers with a\n44:``predict`` method::\n45:\n46:    estimator.predict(X_test)\n47:\n48:Inliers are labeled 1, while outliers are labeled -1. The predict method\n49:makes use of a threshold on the raw scoring function computed by the\n50:estimator. This scoring function is accessible through the ``score_samples``\n51:method, while the threshold can be controlled by the ``contamination``\n52:parameter.\n53:\n54:The ``decision_function`` method is also defined from the scoring function,\n55:in such a way that negative values are outliers and non-negative ones are\n56:inliers::\n57:\n58:    estimator.decision_function(X_test)\n59:\n60:Note that :class:`neighbors.LocalOutlierFactor` does not support\n61:``predict``, ``decision_function`` and ``score_samples`` methods by default\n62:but only a ``fit_predict`` method, as this estimator was originally meant to\n63:be applied for outlier detection.

The idea is to detect the samples that have a substantially\n283:lower density than their neighbors.\n284:\n285:In practice the local density is obtained from the k-nearest neighbors.\n286:The LOF score of an observation is equal to the ratio of the\n287:average local density of his k-nearest neighbors, and its own local density:\n288:a normal instance is expected to have a local density similar to that of its\n289:neighbors, while abnormal data are expected to have much smaller local density.\n290:\n291:The number k of neighbors considered, (alias parameter n_neighbors) is typically\n292:chosen 1) greater than the minimum number of objects a cluster has to contain,\n293:so that other objects can be local outliers relative to this cluster, and 2)\n294:smaller than the maximum number of close by objects that can potentially be\n295:local outliers.\n296:In practice, such informations are generally not available, and taking\n(72 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn/doc/modules/outlier_detection.rst)\n(Current directory: /scikit-learn__scikit-learn)\nbash-$",

From this assumption, we generally try to define the\n188:\"shape\" of the data, and can define outlying observations as\n189:observations which stand far enough from the fit shape.\n190:\n191:The scikit-learn provides an object\n192::class:`covariance.EllipticEnvelope` that fits a robust covariance\n193:estimate to the data, and thus fits an ellipse to the central data\n194:points, ignoring points outside the central mode.\n195:\n196:For instance, assuming that the inlier data are Gaussian distributed, it\n197:will estimate the inlier location and covariance in a robust way (i.e.\n198:without being influenced by outliers).
