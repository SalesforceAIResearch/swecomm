Let the object print itself if it knows how.\n9:  2. Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.\n10:  3. As fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.\n11:\n12:Which Method is Responsible for Printing?\n13:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n14:\n15:The whole printing process is started by calling ``.doprint(expr)`` on the printer\n16:which you want to use. This method looks for an appropriate method which can\n17:print the given expression in the given style that the printer defines.\n18:While looking for the method, it follows these steps:\n19:\n20:1. **Let the object print itself if it knows how.**\n21:\n22:    The printer looks for a specific method in every object. The name of that method\n23:    depends on the specific printer and is defined under ``Printer.printmethod``.\n24:    For example, StrPrinter calls ``_sympystr`` and LatexPrinter calls ``_latex``.\n25:    Look at the documentation of the printer that you want to use.\n26:    The name of the method is specified there.\n27:\n28:    This was the original way of doing printing in sympy. Every class had\n29:    its own latex, mathml, str and repr methods, but it turned out that it\n30:    is hard to produce a high quality printer, if all the methods are spread\n31:    out that far. Therefore all printing code was combined into the different\n32:    printers, which works great for built-in sympy objects, but not that\n33:    good for user defined classes where it is inconvenient to patch the\n34:    printers.\n35:\n36:2. **Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.**\n37:\n38:    The printer loops through expr classes (class + its bases), and tries\n39:    to dispatch the work to ``_print_<EXPR_CLASS>``\n40:\n41:    e.g., suppose we have the following class hierarchy::\n42:\n43:            Basic\n44:            |\n45:            Atom\n46:            |\n47:            Number\n48:            |\n49:        Rational\n50:\n51:    then, for ``expr=Rational(...)``, the Printer will try\n52:    to call printer methods in the order as shown in the figure below::\n53:\n54:        p._print(expr)\n55:        |\n56:        |-- p._print_Rational(expr)\n57:        |\n58:        |-- p._print_Number(expr)\n59:        |\n60:        |-- p._print_Atom(expr)\n61:        |\n62:        `-- p._print_Basic(expr)\n63:\n64:    if ``._print_Rational`` method exists in the printer, then it is called,\n65:    and the result is returned back. Otherwise, the printer tries to call\n66:    ``._print_Number`` and so on.\n67:\n68:3. **As a fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.**\n69:\n70:    As fall-back ``self.emptyPrinter`` will be called with the expression. If\n71:    not defined in the Printer subclass this will be the same as ``str(expr)``.\n72:\n73:Example of Custom Printer\n74:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n75:\n76:.. _printer_example:\n77:\n78:In the example below, we have a printer which prints the derivative of a function\n79:in a shorter form.\n80:\n81:.. code-block:: python\n82:\n83:    from sympy import Symbol\n84:    from sympy.printing.latex import LatexPrinter, print_latex\n85:    from sympy.core.function import UndefinedFunction, Function\n86:\n87:\n88:    class MyLatexPrinter(LatexPrinter):\n89:        \\\"\\\"\\\"Print derivative of a function of symbols in a shorter form.\n90:        \\\"\\\"\\\"\n91:        def _print_Derivative(self, expr):\n92:            function, *vars = expr.args\n93:            if not isinstance(type(function), UndefinedFunction) or \\\\\n94:               not all(isinstance(i, Symbol) for i in vars):\n95:                return super()._print_Derivative(expr)\n96:\n97:            # If you want the printer to work correctly for nested\n98:            # expressions then use self._print() instead of str() or latex().\n99:            # See the example of nested modulo below in the custom printing\n100:            # method section.\n(200 more lines below)\n",

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [required]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [required]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for\n    - dir (string) [required]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not idented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n```\nls -a\n```\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nLet's first start by reproducing the results of the issue. The issue includes some example code for reproduction, which we can use. We'll create a new file called `reproduce.py` and paste the example code into it.\n```\ncreate reproduce.py\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (1 lines total)]\n1:\n\n(Open file: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nNow let's paste in the example code from the issue.\n```\nedit 1:1\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nend_of_edit\n```\n[File: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py (9 lines total)]\n1:from marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\n2:from datetime import timedelta\n3:\n4:td_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n5:\n6:obj = dict()\n7:obj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n8:\n9:print(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\nFile updated.

Edit the file again if necessary.\n\n(Open file: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nNow let's run the code to see if we see the same output as the issue.\n```\npython reproduce.py\n```\n344\n\n(Open file: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow/reproduce.py)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$\nWe are indeed seeing the same output as the issue. The issue suggests that we should look at line 1474 of the `fields.py` file to see if there is a rounding issue. Let's open the `fields.py` file and navigate to line 1474 to see the relevant code. First we should find the `fields.py` file in the repository.

The current implementation uses integer division, which truncates the decimal part and can lead to incorrect rounding on line 1475.To fix this issue, we should ensure that the division results in a float, and then round the result to the nearest integer before converting it to an int.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLambdify misinterprets some matrix expressions\nUsing lambdify on an expression containing an identity matrix gives us an unexpected result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import numpy as np\r\n>>> n = symbols('n', integer=True)\r\n>>> A = MatrixSymbol(\"A\", n, n)\r\n>>> a = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\r\n>>> f = lambdify(A, A + Identity(n))\r\n>>> f(a)\r\narray([[1.+1.j, 2.+1.j],\r\n       [3.+1.j, 4.+1.j]])\r\n```\r\n\r\nInstead, the output should be  `array([[2, 2], [3, 5]])`, since we're adding an identity matrix to the array. Inspecting the globals and source code of `f` shows us why we get the result:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n>>> import inspect\r\n>>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\r\ndef _lambdifygenerated(A):\r\n    return (I + A)\r\n>>> f.__globals__['I']\r\n1j\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe code printer prints `I`, which is currently being interpreted as a Python built-in complex number. The printer should support printing identity matrices, and signal an error for unsupported expressions that might be misinterpreted.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line! \n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

Let the object print itself if it knows how.\n9:  2. Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.\n10:  3. As fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.\n11:\n12:Which Method is Responsible for Printing?\n13:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n14:\n15:The whole printing process is started by calling ``.doprint(expr)`` on the printer\n16:which you want to use. This method looks for an appropriate method which can\n17:print the given expression in the given style that the printer defines.\n18:While looking for the method, it follows these steps:\n19:\n20:1. **Let the object print itself if it knows how.**\n21:\n22:    The printer looks for a specific method in every object. The name of that method\n23:    depends on the specific printer and is defined under ``Printer.printmethod``.\n24:    For example, StrPrinter calls ``_sympystr`` and LatexPrinter calls ``_latex``.\n25:    Look at the documentation of the printer that you want to use.\n26:    The name of the method is specified there.\n27:\n28:    This was the original way of doing printing in sympy. Every class had\n29:    its own latex, mathml, str and repr methods, but it turned out that it\n30:    is hard to produce a high quality printer, if all the methods are spread\n31:    out that far. Therefore all printing code was combined into the different\n32:    printers, which works great for built-in sympy objects, but not that\n33:    good for user defined classes where it is inconvenient to patch the\n34:    printers.\n35:\n36:2. **Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.**\n37:\n38:    The printer loops through expr classes (class + its bases), and tries\n39:    to dispatch the work to ``_print_<EXPR_CLASS>``\n40:\n41:    e.g., suppose we have the following class hierarchy::\n42:\n43:            Basic\n44:            |\n45:            Atom\n46:            |\n47:            Number\n48:            |\n49:        Rational\n50:\n51:    then, for ``expr=Rational(...)``, the Printer will try\n52:    to call printer methods in the order as shown in the figure below::\n53:\n54:        p._print(expr)\n55:        |\n56:        |-- p._print_Rational(expr)\n57:        |\n58:        |-- p._print_Number(expr)\n59:        |\n60:        |-- p._print_Atom(expr)\n61:        |\n62:        `-- p._print_Basic(expr)\n63:\n64:    if ``._print_Rational`` method exists in the printer, then it is called,\n65:    and the result is returned back. Otherwise, the printer tries to call\n66:    ``._print_Number`` and so on.\n67:\n68:3. **As a fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.**\n69:\n70:    As fall-back ``self.emptyPrinter`` will be called with the expression.
