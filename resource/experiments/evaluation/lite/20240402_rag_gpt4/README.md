# SWE-bench RAG Baseline
As part of the original SWE-bench [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06770), we introduce Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) as the baseline approach for solving SWE-bench problems.
* We use BM25, with the issue as the key and file contents as values, to retrieve the most relevant code snippets.
* We then prompt a model (e.g. GPT-4, Claude 3 Opus) with a task description and the relevant code files, and ask it to generate a patch.

You can check out the following links to learn more about this approach:
