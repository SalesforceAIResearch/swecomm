# AutoCodeRover-v20240408

AutoCodeRover is a project structure-aware autonomous software engineering agent
aimed at autonomous program improvement.
AutoCodeRover iteratively retrieves the relevant program context through
AST-level code retrieval APIs.
AutoCodeRover also integrates software debugging capabilities into the agent.
When test cases are available, AutoCodeRover can employ localization
techniques such as Spectrum-based Fault Localization to identify more
relevant program locations for the task.

AutoCodeRover-v20240408 was released together with the
[arXiv paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05427).
The results in the paper were an underestimationâ€”some correct patches were classified
as wrong, due to missing dependencies in the patch evaluation environment (more details
can be found [here](https://github.com/nus-apr/auto-code-rover/issues/45)).
The same set of patches generated by AutoCodeRover in the initial April release has been re-evaluated
using a [dockerized evaluation environment](https://github.com/aorwall/SWE-bench-docker),
and the report is included in this submission.
