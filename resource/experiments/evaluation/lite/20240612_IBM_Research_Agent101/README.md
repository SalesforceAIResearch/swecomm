* **[Jun. 11, 2024]**: ðŸŽ‰ We propose :robot: Agent 101 :robot:, a Software Engineering Agent framework that can resolve $26.7$% of issues (without hints) on [SWE-bench lite](https://www.swebench.com).


Inspired by how humans resolve GitHub issues in the real world, we design the prompt carefully to guide an autonomous agent towards a methodical step-by-step approach. Compared to current baselines, Agent-101 leverages actions that measure syntactic similarity in code and are intuitive from the perspective of how a human would try to understand the problem. At the same time, Agent 101 carefully constructs outputs with precise information from the environment to be passed to a frontier closed-source Large Language Model (LLM) to help in the next iteration. It also leverages the known tests in a repository (excluding the held-out tests), guiding itself to use test output (pass/fail) to adapt and update its generated code accordingly. Agent-101 also makes use of improved and effective tools like edit repair and open actions that prevent many errors with wrong indentation, missing imports, or imprecise line numbers. Finally, our agent has an "LLM-as-a-judge" meta-module that chooses which patch is the final one to submit (without access to held-out tests). Unlike some systems on the leaderboard, Agent-101 uses only a single LLM to ensure solution efficiency as a key outcome.
