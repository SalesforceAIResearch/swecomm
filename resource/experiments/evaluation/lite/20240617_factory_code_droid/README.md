# Factory Code Droid

Factory's mission is to Bring Autonomy to Software Engineering. To this end, we are building Droids
— intelligent, autonomous systems designed to accelerate software engineering.

The Code Droid automates tedious software development tasks, turning well-specified project tickets
into ready-to-merge, thoroughly-tested pull requests. The Code Droid solves tickets by making
changes to the codebase, testing those changes, iterating as needed, and finally creating a pull
request with the completed solution. It is being used today in production developer workflows to
implement new features, fix bugs, speed up large scale refactoring, and more.

More details can be found in the [Code Droid Technical Report](https://www.factory.ai/news/code-droid-technical-report).

We’re hiring researchers and engineers to reinvent how software is built.
