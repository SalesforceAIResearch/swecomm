# Aide by Codestory

Aide is an agentic editor which allows you to work with multiple AI agents right in the editor. For these SWE-Bench Lite results, the agents were powered by Sonnet3.5 and GPT4-o and resolved 126/300 (42%) a new state-of-the-art result.
All these results are at pass@1, without using `hint_text` and in an unassisted setting.
