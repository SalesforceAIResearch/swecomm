# MarsCode Agent v20240723-dev
MarsCode Agent is an LLM-based AI coding assistant developed by ByteDance. We use the SWE-bench Lite dataset to evaluate the development version of MarsCode Agent. MarsCode Agent v20240723-dev achieved a resolution rate of 102/300=34% on SWE-bench Lite.

* MarsCode Agent is a multi-language agent framework for IDE scenarios. In this test, we did not specifically optimize the python language used by SWE-bench Lite instances.

* MarsCode Agent uses mixed models such as GPT-4o for this evaluation.

* Marscde Agent uses common and effective tools such as code knowledge graph, language service, static analysis, etc. to improve the effectiveness of the solution.

In the near future, MarsCode Agent will be integrated into MarsCode IDE to provide users with automatic programming capabilities.
