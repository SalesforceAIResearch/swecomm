      "observation": "[File: /sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/printer.py (300 lines total)]\n1:\"\"\"Printing subsystem driver\n2:\n3:SymPy's printing system works the following way: Any expression can be\n4:passed to a designated Printer who then is responsible to return an\n5:adequate representation of that expression.\n6:\n7:**The basic concept is the following:**\n8:  1. Let the object print itself if it knows how.\n9:  2. Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.\n10:  3. As fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.\n11:\n12:Which Method is Responsible for Printing?\n13:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n14:\n15:The whole printing process is started by calling ``.doprint(expr)`` on the printer\n16:which you want to use. This method looks for an appropriate method which can\n17:print the given expression in the given style that the printer defines.\n18:While looking for the method, it follows these steps:\n19:\n20:1. **Let the object print itself if it knows how.**\n21:\n22:    The printer looks for a specific method in every object. The name of that method\n23:    depends on the specific printer and is defined under ``Printer.printmethod``.\n24:    For example, StrPrinter calls ``_sympystr`` and LatexPrinter calls ``_latex``.\n25:    Look at the documentation of the printer that you want to use.\n26:    The name of the method is specified there.\n27:\n28:    This was the original way of doing printing in sympy. Every class had\n29:    its own latex, mathml, str and repr methods, but it turned out that it\n30:    is hard to produce a high quality printer, if all the methods are spread\n31:    out that far. Therefore all printing code was combined into the different\n32:    printers, which works great for built-in sympy objects, but not that\n33:    good for user defined classes where it is inconvenient to patch the\n34:    printers.\n35:\n36:2. **Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.**\n37:\n38:    The printer loops through expr classes (class + its bases), and tries\n39:    to dispatch the work to ``_print_<EXPR_CLASS>``\n40:\n41:    e.g., suppose we have the following class hierarchy::\n42:\n43:            Basic\n44:            |\n45:            Atom\n46:            |\n47:            Number\n48:            |\n49:        Rational\n50:\n51:    then, for ``expr=Rational(...)``, the Printer will try\n52:    to call printer methods in the order as shown in the figure below::\n53:\n54:        p._print(expr)\n55:        |\n56:        |-- p._print_Rational(expr)\n57:        |\n58:        |-- p._print_Number(expr)\n59:        |\n60:        |-- p._print_Atom(expr)\n61:        |\n62:        `-- p._print_Basic(expr)\n63:\n64:    if ``._print_Rational`` method exists in the printer, then it is called,\n65:    and the result is returned back. Otherwise, the printer tries to call\n66:    ``._print_Number`` and so on.\n67:\n68:3. **As a fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.**\n69:\n70:    As fall-back ``self.emptyPrinter`` will be called with the expression. If\n71:    not defined in the Printer subclass this will be the same as ``str(expr)``.\n72:\n73:Example of Custom Printer\n74:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n75:\n76:.. _printer_example:\n77:\n78:In the example below, we have a printer which prints the derivative of a function\n79:in a shorter form.\n80:\n81:.. code-block:: python\n82:\n83:    from sympy import Symbol\n84:    from sympy.printing.latex import LatexPrinter, print_latex\n85:    from sympy.core.function import UndefinedFunction, Function\n86:\n87:\n88:    class MyLatexPrinter(LatexPrinter):\n89:        \\\"\\\"\\\"Print derivative of a function of symbols in a shorter form.\n90:        \\\"\\\"\\\"\n91:        def _print_Derivative(self, expr):\n92:            function, *vars = expr.args\n93:            if not isinstance(type(function), UndefinedFunction) or \\\\\n94:               not all(isinstance(i, Symbol) for i in vars):\n95:                return super()._print_Derivative(expr)\n96:\n97:            # If you want the printer to work correctly for nested\n98:            # expressions then use self._print() instead of str() or latex().\n99:            # See the example of nested modulo below in the custom printing\n100:            # method section.\n(200 more lines below)",

Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly.

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nBad centering for Sum pretty print\n```\r\n>>> pprint(Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3)\r\n  \u221e\r\n ___\r\n \u2572\r\n  \u2572   x\r\n  \u2571     + 3\r\n \u2571\r\n \u203e\u203e\u203e\r\nx = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `x` and the `+ 3` should be aligned. I'm not sure if the `x` should be lower of if the `+ 3` should be higher. \n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

Let the object print itself if it knows how.\n9:  2. Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.\n10:  3. As fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.\n11:\n12:Which Method is Responsible for Printing?\n13:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n14:\n15:The whole printing process is started by calling ``.doprint(expr)`` on the printer\n16:which you want to use. This method looks for an appropriate method which can\n17:print the given expression in the given style that the printer defines.\n18:While looking for the method, it follows these steps:\n19:\n20:1. **Let the object print itself if it knows how.**\n21:\n22:    The printer looks for a specific method in every object. The name of that method\n23:    depends on the specific printer and is defined under ``Printer.printmethod``.\n24:    For example, StrPrinter calls ``_sympystr`` and LatexPrinter calls ``_latex``.\n25:    Look at the documentation of the printer that you want to use.\n26:    The name of the method is specified there.\n27:\n28:    This was the original way of doing printing in sympy. Every class had\n29:    its own latex, mathml, str and repr methods, but it turned out that it\n30:    is hard to produce a high quality printer, if all the methods are spread\n31:    out that far. Therefore all printing code was combined into the different\n32:    printers, which works great for built-in sympy objects, but not that\n33:    good for user defined classes where it is inconvenient to patch the\n34:    printers.\n35:\n36:2. **Take the best fitting method defined in the printer.**\n37:\n38:    The printer loops through expr classes (class + its bases), and tries\n39:    to dispatch the work to ``_print_<EXPR_CLASS>``\n40:\n41:    e.g., suppose we have the following class hierarchy::\n42:\n43:            Basic\n44:            |\n45:            Atom\n46:            |\n47:            Number\n48:            |\n49:        Rational\n50:\n51:    then, for ``expr=Rational(...)``, the Printer will try\n52:    to call printer methods in the order as shown in the figure below::\n53:\n54:        p._print(expr)\n55:        |\n56:        |-- p._print_Rational(expr)\n57:        |\n58:        |-- p._print_Number(expr)\n59:        |\n60:        |-- p._print_Atom(expr)\n61:        |\n62:        `-- p._print_Basic(expr)\n63:\n64:    if ``._print_Rational`` method exists in the printer, then it is called,\n65:    and the result is returned back. Otherwise, the printer tries to call\n66:    ``._print_Number`` and so on.\n67:\n68:3. **As a fall-back use the emptyPrinter method for the printer.**\n69:\n70:    As fall-back ``self.emptyPrinter`` will be called with the expression. If\n71:    not defined in the Printer subclass this will be the same as ``str(expr)``.\n72:\n73:Example of Custom Printer\n74:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n75:\n76:.. _printer_example:\n77:\n78:In the example below, we have a printer which prints the derivative of a function\n79:in a shorter form.\n80:\n81:.. code-block:: python\n82:\n83:    from sympy import Symbol\n84:    from sympy.printing.latex import LatexPrinter, print_latex\n85:    from sympy.core.function import UndefinedFunction, Function\n86:\n87:\n88:    class MyLatexPrinter(LatexPrinter):\n89:        \\\"\\\"\\\"Print derivative of a function of symbols in a shorter form.\n90:        \\\"\\\"\\\"\n91:        def _print_Derivative(self, expr):\n92:            function, *vars = expr.args\n93:            if not isinstance(type(function), UndefinedFunction) or \\\\\n94:               not all(isinstance(i, Symbol) for i in vars):\n95:                return super()._print_Derivative(expr)\n96:\n97:            # If you want the printer to work correctly for nested\n98:            # expressions then use self._print() instead of str() or latex().\n99:            # See the example of nested modulo below in the custom printing\n100:            # method section.\n(200 more lines below)\n(Open file: /sympy__sympy/sympy/printing/printer.py)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",
