The `AddIndex` operation that includes the `_order` field is being executed before the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation creates the `_order` field.\n+\n+To fix this, you need to modify your migration file to ensure that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is executed before the `AddIndex` operation that includes the `_order` field.\n+\n+Here's how you can fix it:\n+\n+1. Open your migration file (it should be in your app's `migrations` folder).\n+\n+2. Locate the `operations` list in your migration file.\n+\n+3. Move the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any `AddIndex` operations that include the `_order` field.\n+\n+Your operations list should look something like this after the change:\n+\n+```python\n+operations = [\n+    migrations.CreateModel(\n+        name='LookImage',\n+        fields=[\n+            # ... your fields ...\n+        ],\n+    ),\n+    migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(\n+        name='lookimage',\n+        order_with_respect_to='look',\n+    ),\n+    migrations.AddIndex(\n+        model_name='lookimage',\n+        index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),\n+    ),\n+    # ... other AddIndex operations ...\n+]\n+```\n+\n+4. Save the migration file.\n+\n+5. Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply the changes.\n+\n+This order ensures that the `_order` field is created before any indexes that depend on it are added.\n+\n+Remember, if you've already applied the migration, you might need to revert it, make these changes, and then apply it again. Be careful when doing this on a production database, and always make sure you have a backup.\n+\n+If you're creating a new migration, you can use the `migrations.RunSQL` operation to manually create the index after the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation, which gives you more control over the exact order of operations.\n",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

And a new migration file based on the model looks like the code above.\nThe problem is operation AlterOrderWithRespectTo after AddIndex of '_order' raising error because '_order' field had not been created yet.\nIt seems to be AlterOrderWithRespectTo has to proceed before AddIndex of '_order'.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$",

You can also write your own ``Operation`` classes if you want\n20:to encapsulate a custom change you commonly make.\n21:\n22:If you need an empty migration file to write your own ``Operation`` objects\n23:into, use ``python manage.py makemigrations --empty yourappname``, but be aware\n24:that manually adding schema-altering operations can confuse the migration\n25:autodetector and make resulting runs of :djadmin:`makemigrations` output\n26:incorrect code.\n27:\n28:All of the core Django operations are available from the\n29:``django.db.migrations.operations`` module.\n30:\n31:For introductory material, see the :doc:`migrations topic guide\n32:</topics/migrations>`.\n33:\n34:Schema Operations\n35:=================\n36:\n37:``CreateModel``\n38:---------------\n39:\n40:.. class:: CreateModel(name, fields, options=None, bases=None, managers=None)\n41:\n42:Creates a new model in the project history and a corresponding table in the\n43:database to match it.\n44:\n45:``name`` is the model name, as would be written in the ``models.py`` file.\n46:\n47:``fields`` is a list of 2-tuples of ``(field_name, field_instance)``.\n48:The field instance should be an unbound field (so just\n49:``models.CharField(...)``, rather than a field taken from another model).\n50:\n51:``options`` is an optional dictionary of values from the model's ``Meta`` class.\n52:\n53:``bases`` is an optional list of other classes to have this model inherit from;\n54:it can contain both class objects as well as strings in the format\n55:``\"appname.ModelName\"`` if you want to depend on another model (so you inherit\n56:from the historical version).

The `AddIndex` operation that includes the `_order` field is being executed before the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation creates the `_order` field.\n+\n+To fix this, you need to modify your migration file to ensure that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation is executed before the `AddIndex` operation that includes the `_order` field.\n+\n+Here's how you can fix it:\n+\n+1. Open your migration file (it should be in your app's `migrations` folder).\n+\n+2. Locate the `operations` list in your migration file.\n+\n+3. Move the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any `AddIndex` operations that include the `_order` field.\n+\n+Your operations list should look something like this after the change:\n+\n+```python\n+operations = [\n+    migrations.CreateModel(\n+        name='LookImage',\n+        fields=[\n+            # ... your fields ...\n+        ],\n+    ),\n+    migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo(\n+        name='lookimage',\n+        order_with_respect_to='look',\n+    ),\n+    migrations.AddIndex(\n+        model_name='lookimage',\n+        index=models.Index(fields=['look', '_order'], name='look_image_look_id_eaff30_idx'),\n+    ),\n+    # ... other AddIndex operations ...\n+]\n+```\n+\n+4. Save the migration file.\n+\n+5. Run `python manage.py migrate` to apply the changes.\n+\n+This order ensures that the `_order` field is created before any indexes that depend on it are added.\n+\n+Remember, if you've already applied the migration, you might need to revert it, make these changes, and then apply it again. Be careful when doing this on a production database, and always make sure you have a backup.\n+\n+If you're creating a new migration, you can use the `migrations.RunSQL` operation to manually create the index after the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation, which gives you more control over the exact order of operations.\n",
