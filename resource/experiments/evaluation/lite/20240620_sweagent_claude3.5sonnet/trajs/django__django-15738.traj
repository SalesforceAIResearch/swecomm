They're\n10:designed to be mostly automatic, but you'll need to know when to make\n11:migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.\n12:\n13:The Commands\n14:============\n15:\n16:There are several commands which you will use to interact with migrations\n17:and Django's handling of database schema:\n18:\n19:* :djadmin:`migrate`, which is responsible for applying and unapplying\n20:  migrations.\n21:\n22:* :djadmin:`makemigrations`, which is responsible for creating new migrations\n23:  based on the changes you have made to your models.\n24:\n25:* :djadmin:`sqlmigrate`, which displays the SQL statements for a migration.\n26:\n27:* :djadmin:`showmigrations`, which lists a project's migrations and their\n28:  status.\n29:\n30:You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database\n31:schema. ``makemigrations`` is responsible for packaging up your model changes\n32:into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and ``migrate`` is\n33:responsible for applying those to your database.\n34:\n35:The migration files for each app live in a \"migrations\" directory inside\n36:of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part\n37:of, its codebase. You should be making them once on your development machine\n38:and then running the same migrations on your colleagues' machines, your\n39:staging machines, and eventually your production machines.\n40:\n41:.. note::\n42:    It is possible to override the name of the package which contains the\n43:    migrations on a per-app basis by modifying the :setting:`MIGRATION_MODULES`\n44:    setting.\n45:\n46:Migrations will run the same way on the same dataset and produce consistent\n47:results, meaning that what you see in development and staging is, under the\n48:same circumstances, exactly what will happen in production.\n49:\n50:Django will make migrations for any change to your models or fields - even\n51:options that don't affect the database - as the only way it can reconstruct\n52:a field correctly is to have all the changes in the history, and you might\n53:need those options in some data migrations later on (for example, if you've\n54:set custom validators).\n55:\n56:Backend Support\n57:===============\n58:\n59:Migrations are supported on all backends that Django ships with, as well\n60:as any third-party backends if they have programmed in support for schema\n61:alteration (done via the :doc:`SchemaEditor </ref/schema-editor>` class).\n62:\n63:However, some databases are more capable than others when it comes to\n64:schema migrations; some of the caveats are covered below.\n65:\n66:PostgreSQL\n67:----------\n68:\n69:PostgreSQL is the most capable of all the databases here in terms of schema\n70:support.\n71:\n72:MySQL\n73:-----\n74:\n75:MySQL lacks support for transactions around schema alteration operations,\n76:meaning that if a migration fails to apply you will have to manually unpick\n77:the changes in order to try again (it's impossible to roll back to an\n78:earlier point).\n79:\n80:In addition, MySQL will fully rewrite tables for almost every schema operation\n81:and generally takes a time proportional to the number of rows in the table to\n82:add or remove columns. On slower hardware this can be worse than a minute per\n83:million rows - adding a few columns to a table with just a few million rows\n84:could lock your site up for over ten minutes.\n85:\n86:Finally, MySQL has relatively small limits on name lengths for columns, tables\n87:and indexes, as well as a limit on the combined size of all columns an index\n88:covers. This means that indexes that are possible on other backends will\n89:fail to be created under MySQL.\n90:\n91:SQLite\n92:------\n93:\n94:SQLite has very little built-in schema alteration support, and so Django\n95:attempts to emulate it by:\n96:\n97:* Creating a new table with the new schema\n98:* Copying the data across\n99:* Dropping the old table\n100:* Renaming the new table to match the original name\n(768 more lines below)",

They're\n10:designed to be mostly automatic, but you'll need to know when to make\n11:migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.\n12:\n13:The Commands\n14:============\n15:\n16:There are several commands which you will use to interact with migrations\n17:and Django's handling of database schema:\n18:\n19:* :djadmin:`migrate`, which is responsible for applying and unapplying\n20:  migrations.\n21:\n22:* :djadmin:`makemigrations`, which is responsible for creating new migrations\n23:  based on the changes you have made to your models.\n24:\n25:* :djadmin:`sqlmigrate`, which displays the SQL statements for a migration.\n26:\n27:* :djadmin:`showmigrations`, which lists a project's migrations and their\n28:  status.\n29:\n30:You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database\n31:schema. ``makemigrations`` is responsible for packaging up your model changes\n32:into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and ``migrate`` is\n33:responsible for applying those to your database.\n34:\n35:The migration files for each app live in a \"migrations\" directory inside\n36:of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part\n37:of, its codebase. You should be making them once on your development machine\n38:and then running the same migrations on your colleagues' machines, your\n39:staging machines, and eventually your production machines.\n40:\n41:.. note::\n42:    It is possible to override the name of the package which contains the\n43:    migrations on a per-app basis by modifying the :setting:`MIGRATION_MODULES`\n44:    setting.\n45:\n46:Migrations will run the same way on the same dataset and produce consistent\n47:results, meaning that what you see in development and staging is, under the\n48:same circumstances, exactly what will happen in production.\n49:\n50:Django will make migrations for any change to your models or fields - even\n51:options that don't affect the database - as the only way it can reconstruct\n52:a field correctly is to have all the changes in the history, and you might\n53:need those options in some data migrations later on (for example, if you've\n54:set custom validators).\n55:\n56:Backend Support\n57:===============\n58:\n59:Migrations are supported on all backends that Django ships with, as well\n60:as any third-party backends if they have programmed in support for schema\n61:alteration (done via the :doc:`SchemaEditor </ref/schema-editor>` class).\n62:\n63:However, some databases are more capable than others when it comes to\n64:schema migrations; some of the caveats are covered below.\n65:\n66:PostgreSQL\n67:----------\n68:\n69:PostgreSQL is the most capable of all the databases here in terms of schema\n70:support.\n71:\n72:MySQL\n73:-----\n74:\n75:MySQL lacks support for transactions around schema alteration operations,\n76:meaning that if a migration fails to apply you will have to manually unpick\n77:the changes in order to try again (it's impossible to roll back to an\n78:earlier point).\n79:\n80:In addition, MySQL will fully rewrite tables for almost every schema operation\n81:and generally takes a time proportional to the number of rows in the table to\n82:add or remove columns. On slower hardware this can be worse than a minute per\n83:million rows - adding a few columns to a table with just a few million rows\n84:could lock your site up for over ten minutes.\n85:\n86:Finally, MySQL has relatively small limits on name lengths for columns, tables\n87:and indexes, as well as a limit on the combined size of all columns an index\n88:covers. This means that indexes that are possible on other backends will\n89:fail to be created under MySQL.\n90:\n91:SQLite\n92:------\n93:\n94:SQLite has very little built-in schema alteration support, and so Django\n95:attempts to emulate it by:\n96:\n97:* Creating a new table with the new schema\n98:* Copying the data across\n99:* Dropping the old table\n100:* Renaming the new table to match the original name\n(779 more lines below)",

Here's the recommended approach:\n+\n+1. Remove the unique_together constraint:\n+   \n+   a. Create a migration to remove the unique_together constraint:\n+      \n+      python manage.py makemigrations <app_name> --empty\n+\n+   b. Edit the generated migration file to include the RemoveConstraint operation:\n+\n+      from django.db import migrations\n+\n+      class Migration(migrations.Migration):\n+          dependencies = [\n+              ('<app_name>', '<previous_migration>'),\n+          ]\n+\n+          operations = [\n+              migrations.RemoveConstraint(\n+                  model_name='<model_name>',\n+                  name='<constraint_name>',\n+              ),\n+          ]\n+\n+   c. Apply the migration:\n+      \n+      python manage.py migrate <app_name>\n+\n+2. Convert the ForeignKey to ManyToManyField:\n+   \n+   a. Update your model in models.py, changing the ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField.\n+   \n+   b. Create a new migration:\n+      \n+      python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>\n+\n+   c. Apply the migration:\n+      \n+      python manage.py migrate <app_name>\n+\n+3. Data migration (if needed):\n+   \n+   If you need to preserve the existing relationships, you may need to create a data migration to transfer the data from the old ForeignKey to the new ManyToManyField.\n+\n+By following these steps, you can avoid the \"ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints\" error and successfully convert a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField while removing a unique_together constraint.\n",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nModels migration with change field foreign to many and deleting unique together.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by Simon Charette)\n\t \nI have models like\nclass Authors(models.Model):\n\tproject_data_set = models.ForeignKey(\n\t\tProjectDataSet,\n\t\ton_delete=models.PROTECT\n\t)\n\tstate = models.IntegerField()\n\tstart_date = models.DateField()\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\t unique_together = (('project_data_set', 'state', 'start_date'),)\nand\nclass DataSet(models.Model):\n\tname = models.TextField(max_length=50)\nclass Project(models.Model):\n\tdata_sets = models.ManyToManyField(\n\t\tDataSet,\n\t\tthrough='ProjectDataSet',\n\t)\n\tname = models.TextField(max_length=50)\nclass ProjectDataSet(models.Model):\n\t\"\"\"\n\tCross table of data set and project\n\t\"\"\"\n\tdata_set = models.ForeignKey(DataSet, on_delete=models.PROTECT)\n\tproject = models.ForeignKey(Project, on_delete=models.PROTECT)\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tunique_together = (('data_set', 'project'),)\nwhen i want to change field project_data_set in Authors model from foreign key field to many to many field I must delete a unique_together, cause it can't be on many to many field.\nThen my model should be like:\nclass Authors(models.Model):\n\tproject_data_set = models.ManyToManyField(\n\t\tProjectDataSet,\n\t)\n\tstate = models.IntegerField()\n\tstart_date = models.DateField()\nBut when I want to do a migrations.\npython3 manage.py makemigrations\npython3 manage.py migrate\nI have error:\nValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints for app_authors(project_data_set, state, start_date)\nThe database is on production, so I can't delete previous initial migrations, and this error isn't depending on database, cause I delete it and error is still the same.\nMy solve is to first delete unique_together, then do a makemigrations and then migrate. After that change the field from foreign key to many to many field, then do a makemigrations and then migrate.\nBut in this way I have 2 migrations instead of one.\nI added attachment with this project, download it and then do makemigrations and then migrate to see this error.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$",

They're\n10:designed to be mostly automatic, but you'll need to know when to make\n11:migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.\n12:\n13:The Commands\n14:============\n15:\n16:There are several commands which you will use to interact with migrations\n17:and Django's handling of database schema:\n18:\n19:* :djadmin:`migrate`, which is responsible for applying and unapplying\n20:  migrations.\n21:\n22:* :djadmin:`makemigrations`, which is responsible for creating new migrations\n23:  based on the changes you have made to your models.\n24:\n25:* :djadmin:`sqlmigrate`, which displays the SQL statements for a migration.\n26:\n27:* :djadmin:`showmigrations`, which lists a project's migrations and their\n28:  status.\n29:\n30:You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database\n31:schema. ``makemigrations`` is responsible for packaging up your model changes\n32:into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and ``migrate`` is\n33:responsible for applying those to your database.\n34:\n35:The migration files for each app live in a \"migrations\" directory inside\n36:of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part\n37:of, its codebase. You should be making them once on your development machine\n38:and then running the same migrations on your colleagues' machines, your\n39:staging machines, and eventually your production machines.\n40:\n41:.. note::\n42:    It is possible to override the name of the package which contains the\n43:    migrations on a per-app basis by modifying the :setting:`MIGRATION_MODULES`\n44:    setting.\n45:\n46:Migrations will run the same way on the same dataset and produce consistent\n47:results, meaning that what you see in development and staging is, under the\n48:same circumstances, exactly what will happen in production.\n49:\n50:Django will make migrations for any change to your models or fields - even\n51:options that don't affect the database - as the only way it can reconstruct\n52:a field correctly is to have all the changes in the history, and you might\n53:need those options in some data migrations later on (for example, if you've\n54:set custom validators).\n55:\n56:Backend Support\n57:===============\n58:\n59:Migrations are supported on all backends that Django ships with, as well\n60:as any third-party backends if they have programmed in support for schema\n61:alteration (done via the :doc:`SchemaEditor </ref/schema-editor>` class).\n62:\n63:However, some databases are more capable than others when it comes to\n64:schema migrations; some of the caveats are covered below.\n65:\n66:PostgreSQL\n67:----------\n68:\n69:PostgreSQL is the most capable of all the databases here in terms of schema\n70:support.\n71:\n72:MySQL\n73:-----\n74:\n75:MySQL lacks support for transactions around schema alteration operations,\n76:meaning that if a migration fails to apply you will have to manually unpick\n77:the changes in order to try again (it's impossible to roll back to an\n78:earlier point).\n79:\n80:In addition, MySQL will fully rewrite tables for almost every schema operation\n81:and generally takes a time proportional to the number of rows in the table to\n82:add or remove columns. On slower hardware this can be worse than a minute per\n83:million rows - adding a few columns to a table with just a few million rows\n84:could lock your site up for over ten minutes.\n85:\n86:Finally, MySQL has relatively small limits on name lengths for columns, tables\n87:and indexes, as well as a limit on the combined size of all columns an index\n88:covers. This means that indexes that are possible on other backends will\n89:fail to be created under MySQL.\n90:\n91:SQLite\n92:------\n93:\n94:SQLite has very little built-in schema alteration support, and so Django\n95:attempts to emulate it by:\n96:\n97:* Creating a new table with the new schema\n98:* Copying the data across\n99:* Dropping the old table\n100:* Renaming the new table to match the original name\n(768 more lines below)\n(Open file: /django__django/docs/topics/migrations.txt)\n(Current directory: /django__django/docs)\nbash-$",

They're\n10:designed to be mostly automatic, but you'll need to know when to make\n11:migrations, when to run them, and the common problems you might run into.\n12:\n13:The Commands\n14:============\n15:\n16:There are several commands which you will use to interact with migrations\n17:and Django's handling of database schema:\n18:\n19:* :djadmin:`migrate`, which is responsible for applying and unapplying\n20:  migrations.\n21:\n22:* :djadmin:`makemigrations`, which is responsible for creating new migrations\n23:  based on the changes you have made to your models.\n24:\n25:* :djadmin:`sqlmigrate`, which displays the SQL statements for a migration.\n26:\n27:* :djadmin:`showmigrations`, which lists a project's migrations and their\n28:  status.\n29:\n30:You should think of migrations as a version control system for your database\n31:schema. ``makemigrations`` is responsible for packaging up your model changes\n32:into individual migration files - analogous to commits - and ``migrate`` is\n33:responsible for applying those to your database.\n34:\n35:The migration files for each app live in a \"migrations\" directory inside\n36:of that app, and are designed to be committed to, and distributed as part\n37:of, its codebase. You should be making them once on your development machine\n38:and then running the same migrations on your colleagues' machines, your\n39:staging machines, and eventually your production machines.\n40:\n41:.. note::\n42:    It is possible to override the name of the package which contains the\n43:    migrations on a per-app basis by modifying the :setting:`MIGRATION_MODULES`\n44:    setting.\n45:\n46:Migrations will run the same way on the same dataset and produce consistent\n47:results, meaning that what you see in development and staging is, under the\n48:same circumstances, exactly what will happen in production.\n49:\n50:Django will make migrations for any change to your models or fields - even\n51:options that don't affect the database - as the only way it can reconstruct\n52:a field correctly is to have all the changes in the history, and you might\n53:need those options in some data migrations later on (for example, if you've\n54:set custom validators).\n55:\n56:Backend Support\n57:===============\n58:\n59:Migrations are supported on all backends that Django ships with, as well\n60:as any third-party backends if they have programmed in support for schema\n61:alteration (done via the :doc:`SchemaEditor </ref/schema-editor>` class).\n62:\n63:However, some databases are more capable than others when it comes to\n64:schema migrations; some of the caveats are covered below.\n65:\n66:PostgreSQL\n67:----------\n68:\n69:PostgreSQL is the most capable of all the databases here in terms of schema\n70:support.\n71:\n72:MySQL\n73:-----\n74:\n75:MySQL lacks support for transactions around schema alteration operations,\n76:meaning that if a migration fails to apply you will have to manually unpick\n77:the changes in order to try again (it's impossible to roll back to an\n78:earlier point).\n79:\n80:In addition, MySQL will fully rewrite tables for almost every schema operation\n81:and generally takes a time proportional to the number of rows in the table to\n82:add or remove columns. On slower hardware this can be worse than a minute per\n83:million rows - adding a few columns to a table with just a few million rows\n84:could lock your site up for over ten minutes.\n85:\n86:Finally, MySQL has relatively small limits on name lengths for columns, tables\n87:and indexes, as well as a limit on the combined size of all columns an index\n88:covers. This means that indexes that are possible on other backends will\n89:fail to be created under MySQL.\n90:\n91:SQLite\n92:------\n93:\n94:SQLite has very little built-in schema alteration support, and so Django\n95:attempts to emulate it by:\n96:\n97:* Creating a new table with the new schema\n98:* Copying the data across\n99:* Dropping the old table\n100:* Renaming the new table to match the original name\n(779 more lines below)\n(Open file: /django__django/docs/topics/migrations.txt)\n(Current directory: /django__django/docs)\nbash-$",

Here's the recommended approach:\n+\n+1. Remove the unique_together constraint:\n+   \n+   a. Create a migration to remove the unique_together constraint:\n+      \n+      python manage.py makemigrations <app_name> --empty\n+\n+   b. Edit the generated migration file to include the RemoveConstraint operation:\n+\n+      from django.db import migrations\n+\n+      class Migration(migrations.Migration):\n+          dependencies = [\n+              ('<app_name>', '<previous_migration>'),\n+          ]\n+\n+          operations = [\n+              migrations.RemoveConstraint(\n+                  model_name='<model_name>',\n+                  name='<constraint_name>',\n+              ),\n+          ]\n+\n+   c. Apply the migration:\n+      \n+      python manage.py migrate <app_name>\n+\n+2. Convert the ForeignKey to ManyToManyField:\n+   \n+   a. Update your model in models.py, changing the ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField.\n+   \n+   b. Create a new migration:\n+      \n+      python manage.py makemigrations <app_name>\n+\n+   c. Apply the migration:\n+      \n+      python manage.py migrate <app_name>\n+\n+3. Data migration (if needed):\n+   \n+   If you need to preserve the existing relationships, you may need to create a data migration to transfer the data from the old ForeignKey to the new ManyToManyField.\n+\n+By following these steps, you can avoid the \"ValueError: Found wrong number (0) of constraints\" error and successfully convert a ForeignKey to a ManyToManyField while removing a unique_together constraint.\n",
