Several classes in\n19:    SymPy appear so often that they are singletonized, that is, using some\n20:    metaprogramming they are made so that they can only be instantiated once\n21:    (see the :class:`sympy.core.singleton.Singleton` class for details). For\n22:    instance, every time you create ``Integer(0)``, this will return the same\n23:    instance, :class:`sympy.core.numbers.Zero`. All singleton instances are\n24:    attributes of the ``S`` object, so ``Integer(0)`` can also be accessed as\n25:    ``S.Zero``.\n26:\n27:    Singletonization offers two advantages: it saves memory, and it allows\n28:    fast comparison. It saves memory because no matter how many times the\n29:    singletonized objects appear in expressions in memory, they all point to\n30:    the same single instance in memory. The fast comparison comes from the\n31:    fact that you can use ``is`` to compare exact instances in Python\n32:    (usually, you need to use ``==`` to compare things). ``is`` compares\n33:    objects by memory address, and is very fast.\n34:\n35:    Examples\n36:    ========\n37:\n38:    >>> from sympy import S, Integer\n39:    >>> a = Integer(0)\n40:    >>> a is S.Zero\n41:    True\n42:\n43:    For the most part, the fact that certain objects are singletonized is an\n44:    implementation detail that users shouldn't need to worry about. In SymPy\n45:    library code, ``is`` comparison is often used for performance purposes\n46:    The primary advantage of ``S`` for end users is the convenient access to\n47:    certain instances that are otherwise difficult to type, like ``S.Half``\n48:    (instead of ``Rational(1, 2)``).\n49:\n50:    When using ``is`` comparison, make sure the argument is sympified. For\n51:    instance,\n52:\n53:    >>> x = 0\n54:    >>> x is S.Zero\n55:    False\n56:\n57:    This problem is not an issue when using ``==``, which is recommended for\n58:    most use-cases:\n59:\n60:    >>> 0 == S.Zero\n61:    True\n62:\n63:    The second thing ``S`` is is a shortcut for\n64:    :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify`. :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify` is\n65:    the function that converts Python objects such as ``int(1)`` into SymPy\n66:    objects such as ``Integer(1)``. It also converts the string form of an\n67:    expression into a SymPy expression, like ``sympify(\"x**2\")`` ->\n68:    ``Symbol(\"x\")**2``. ``S(1)`` is the same thing as ``sympify(1)``\n69:    (basically, ``S.__call__`` has been defined to call ``sympify``).\n70:\n71:    This is for convenience, since ``S`` is a single letter. It's mostly\n72:    useful for defining rational numbers. Consider an expression like ``x +\n73:    1/2``. If you enter this directly in Python, it will evaluate the ``1/2``\n74:    and give ``0.5`` (or just ``0`` in Python 2, because of integer division),\n75:    because both arguments are ints (see also\n76:    :ref:`tutorial-gotchas-final-notes`). However, in SymPy, you usually want\n77:    the quotient of two integers to give an exact rational number.

Several classes in\n19:    SymPy appear so often that they are singletonized, that is, using some\n20:    metaprogramming they are made so that they can only be instantiated once\n21:    (see the :class:`sympy.core.singleton.Singleton` class for details). For\n22:    instance, every time you create ``Integer(0)``, this will return the same\n23:    instance, :class:`sympy.core.numbers.Zero`. All singleton instances are\n24:    attributes of the ``S`` object, so ``Integer(0)`` can also be accessed as\n25:    ``S.Zero``.\n26:\n27:    Singletonization offers two advantages: it saves memory, and it allows\n28:    fast comparison. It saves memory because no matter how many times the\n29:    singletonized objects appear in expressions in memory, they all point to\n30:    the same single instance in memory. The fast comparison comes from the\n31:    fact that you can use ``is`` to compare exact instances in Python\n32:    (usually, you need to use ``==`` to compare things). ``is`` compares\n33:    objects by memory address, and is very fast.\n34:\n35:    Examples\n36:    ========\n37:\n38:    >>> from sympy import S, Integer\n39:    >>> a = Integer(0)\n40:    >>> a is S.Zero\n41:    True\n42:\n43:    For the most part, the fact that certain objects are singletonized is an\n44:    implementation detail that users shouldn't need to worry about. In SymPy\n45:    library code, ``is`` comparison is often used for performance purposes\n46:    The primary advantage of ``S`` for end users is the convenient access to\n47:    certain instances that are otherwise difficult to type, like ``S.Half``\n48:    (instead of ``Rational(1, 2)``).\n49:\n50:    When using ``is`` comparison, make sure the argument is sympified. For\n51:    instance,\n52:\n53:    >>> x = 0\n54:    >>> x is S.Zero\n55:    False\n56:\n57:    This problem is not an issue when using ``==``, which is recommended for\n58:    most use-cases:\n59:\n60:    >>> 0 == S.Zero\n61:    True\n62:\n63:    The second thing ``S`` is is a shortcut for\n64:    :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify`. :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify` is\n65:    the function that converts Python objects such as ``int(1)`` into SymPy\n66:    objects such as ``Integer(1)``. It also converts the string form of an\n67:    expression into a SymPy expression, like ``sympify(\"x**2\")`` ->\n68:    ``Symbol(\"x\")**2``. ``S(1)`` is the same thing as ``sympify(1)``\n69:    (basically, ``S.__call__`` has been defined to call ``sympify``).\n70:\n71:    This is for convenience, since ``S`` is a single letter. It's mostly\n72:    useful for defining rational numbers. Consider an expression like ``x +\n73:    1/2``. If you enter this directly in Python, it will evaluate the ``1/2``\n74:    and give ``0.5`` (or just ``0`` in Python 2, because of integer division),\n75:    because both arguments are ints (see also\n76:    :ref:`tutorial-gotchas-final-notes`). However, in SymPy, you usually want\n77:    the quotient of two integers to give an exact rational number. The way\n78:    Python's evaluation works, at least one side of an operator needs to be a\n79:    SymPy object for the SymPy evaluation to take over. You could write this\n80:    as ``x + Rational(1, 2)``, but this is a lot more typing. A shorter\n81:    version is ``x + S(1)/2``. Since ``S(1)`` returns ``Integer(1)``, the\n82:    division will return a ``Rational`` type, since it will call\n83:    ``Integer.__truediv__``, which knows how to return a ``Rational``.\n84:\n85:    \"\"\"\n86:    __slots__ = ()\n87:\n88:    # Also allow things like S(5)\n89:    __call__ = staticmethod(sympify)\n90:\n91:    def __init__(self):\n92:        self._classes_to_install = {}\n93:        # Dict of classes that have been registered, but that have not have been\n94:        # installed as an attribute of this SingletonRegistry.\n95:        # Installation automatically happens at the first attempt to access the\n96:        # attribute.\n97:        # The purpose of this is to allow registration during class\n98:        # initialization during import, but not trigger object creation until\n99:        # actual use (which should not happen until after all imports are\n100:        # finished).\n(82 more lines below)",

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_up\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file.

The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION.\nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not indented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command.\nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nBug: maximum recusion depth error when checking is_zero of cosh expression\nThe following code causes a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object` error when checked if it is zero:\r\n```\r\nexpr =sympify(\"cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))\")\r\nexpr.is_zero\r\n```\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

Several classes in\n19:    SymPy appear so often that they are singletonized, that is, using some\n20:    metaprogramming they are made so that they can only be instantiated once\n21:    (see the :class:`sympy.core.singleton.Singleton` class for details). For\n22:    instance, every time you create ``Integer(0)``, this will return the same\n23:    instance, :class:`sympy.core.numbers.Zero`. All singleton instances are\n24:    attributes of the ``S`` object, so ``Integer(0)`` can also be accessed as\n25:    ``S.Zero``.\n26:\n27:    Singletonization offers two advantages: it saves memory, and it allows\n28:    fast comparison. It saves memory because no matter how many times the\n29:    singletonized objects appear in expressions in memory, they all point to\n30:    the same single instance in memory. The fast comparison comes from the\n31:    fact that you can use ``is`` to compare exact instances in Python\n32:    (usually, you need to use ``==`` to compare things). ``is`` compares\n33:    objects by memory address, and is very fast.\n34:\n35:    Examples\n36:    ========\n37:\n38:    >>> from sympy import S, Integer\n39:    >>> a = Integer(0)\n40:    >>> a is S.Zero\n41:    True\n42:\n43:    For the most part, the fact that certain objects are singletonized is an\n44:    implementation detail that users shouldn't need to worry about. In SymPy\n45:    library code, ``is`` comparison is often used for performance purposes\n46:    The primary advantage of ``S`` for end users is the convenient access to\n47:    certain instances that are otherwise difficult to type, like ``S.Half``\n48:    (instead of ``Rational(1, 2)``).\n49:\n50:    When using ``is`` comparison, make sure the argument is sympified. For\n51:    instance,\n52:\n53:    >>> x = 0\n54:    >>> x is S.Zero\n55:    False\n56:\n57:    This problem is not an issue when using ``==``, which is recommended for\n58:    most use-cases:\n59:\n60:    >>> 0 == S.Zero\n61:    True\n62:\n63:    The second thing ``S`` is is a shortcut for\n64:    :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify`. :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify` is\n65:    the function that converts Python objects such as ``int(1)`` into SymPy\n66:    objects such as ``Integer(1)``. It also converts the string form of an\n67:    expression into a SymPy expression, like ``sympify(\"x**2\")`` ->\n68:    ``Symbol(\"x\")**2``. ``S(1)`` is the same thing as ``sympify(1)``\n69:    (basically, ``S.__call__`` has been defined to call ``sympify``).\n70:\n71:    This is for convenience, since ``S`` is a single letter. It's mostly\n72:    useful for defining rational numbers. Consider an expression like ``x +\n73:    1/2``. If you enter this directly in Python, it will evaluate the ``1/2``\n74:    and give ``0.5`` (or just ``0`` in Python 2, because of integer division),\n75:    because both arguments are ints (see also\n76:    :ref:`tutorial-gotchas-final-notes`). However, in SymPy, you usually want\n77:    the quotient of two integers to give an exact rational number. The way\n78:    Python's evaluation works, at least one side of an operator needs to be a\n79:    SymPy object for the SymPy evaluation to take over. You could write this\n80:    as ``x + Rational(1, 2)``, but this is a lot more typing. A shorter\n81:    version is ``x + S(1)/2``. Since ``S(1)`` returns ``Integer(1)``, the\n82:    division will return a ``Rational`` type, since it will call\n83:    ``Integer.__truediv__``, which knows how to return a ``Rational``.\n84:\n85:    \"\"\"\n86:    __slots__ = ()\n87:\n88:    # Also allow things like S(5)\n89:    __call__ = staticmethod(sympify)\n90:\n91:    def __init__(self):\n92:        self._classes_to_install = {}\n93:        # Dict of classes that have been registered, but that have not have been\n94:        # installed as an attribute of this SingletonRegistry.\n95:        # Installation automatically happens at the first attempt to access the\n96:        # attribute.\n97:        # The purpose of this is to allow registration during class\n98:        # initialization during import, but not trigger object creation until\n99:        # actual use (which should not happen until after all imports are\n100:        # finished).\n(82 more lines below)\n(Open file: /sympy__sympy/sympy/core/singleton.py)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",

Several classes in\n19:    SymPy appear so often that they are singletonized, that is, using some\n20:    metaprogramming they are made so that they can only be instantiated once\n21:    (see the :class:`sympy.core.singleton.Singleton` class for details). For\n22:    instance, every time you create ``Integer(0)``, this will return the same\n23:    instance, :class:`sympy.core.numbers.Zero`. All singleton instances are\n24:    attributes of the ``S`` object, so ``Integer(0)`` can also be accessed as\n25:    ``S.Zero``.\n26:\n27:    Singletonization offers two advantages: it saves memory, and it allows\n28:    fast comparison. It saves memory because no matter how many times the\n29:    singletonized objects appear in expressions in memory, they all point to\n30:    the same single instance in memory. The fast comparison comes from the\n31:    fact that you can use ``is`` to compare exact instances in Python\n32:    (usually, you need to use ``==`` to compare things). ``is`` compares\n33:    objects by memory address, and is very fast.\n34:\n35:    Examples\n36:    ========\n37:\n38:    >>> from sympy import S, Integer\n39:    >>> a = Integer(0)\n40:    >>> a is S.Zero\n41:    True\n42:\n43:    For the most part, the fact that certain objects are singletonized is an\n44:    implementation detail that users shouldn't need to worry about. In SymPy\n45:    library code, ``is`` comparison is often used for performance purposes\n46:    The primary advantage of ``S`` for end users is the convenient access to\n47:    certain instances that are otherwise difficult to type, like ``S.Half``\n48:    (instead of ``Rational(1, 2)``).\n49:\n50:    When using ``is`` comparison, make sure the argument is sympified. For\n51:    instance,\n52:\n53:    >>> x = 0\n54:    >>> x is S.Zero\n55:    False\n56:\n57:    This problem is not an issue when using ``==``, which is recommended for\n58:    most use-cases:\n59:\n60:    >>> 0 == S.Zero\n61:    True\n62:\n63:    The second thing ``S`` is is a shortcut for\n64:    :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify`. :func:`sympy.core.sympify.sympify` is\n65:    the function that converts Python objects such as ``int(1)`` into SymPy\n66:    objects such as ``Integer(1)``. It also converts the string form of an\n67:    expression into a SymPy expression, like ``sympify(\"x**2\")`` ->\n68:    ``Symbol(\"x\")**2``. ``S(1)`` is the same thing as ``sympify(1)``\n69:    (basically, ``S.__call__`` has been defined to call ``sympify``).\n70:\n71:    This is for convenience, since ``S`` is a single letter. It's mostly\n72:    useful for defining rational numbers. Consider an expression like ``x +\n73:    1/2``. If you enter this directly in Python, it will evaluate the ``1/2``\n74:    and give ``0.5`` (or just ``0`` in Python 2, because of integer division),\n75:    because both arguments are ints (see also\n76:    :ref:`tutorial-gotchas-final-notes`). However, in SymPy, you usually want\n77:    the quotient of two integers to give an exact rational number. The way\n78:    Python's evaluation works, at least one side of an operator needs to be a\n79:    SymPy object for the SymPy evaluation to take over. You could write this\n80:    as ``x + Rational(1, 2)``, but this is a lot more typing. A shorter\n81:    version is ``x + S(1)/2``. Since ``S(1)`` returns ``Integer(1)``, the\n82:    division will return a ``Rational`` type, since it will call\n83:    ``Integer.__truediv__``, which knows how to return a ``Rational``.\n84:\n85:    \"\"\"\n86:    __slots__ = ()\n87:\n88:    # Also allow things like S(5)\n89:    __call__ = staticmethod(sympify)\n90:\n91:    def __init__(self):\n92:        self._classes_to_install = {}\n93:        # Dict of classes that have been registered, but that have not have been\n94:        # installed as an attribute of this SingletonRegistry.\n95:        # Installation automatically happens at the first attempt to access the\n96:        # attribute.\n97:        # The purpose of this is to allow registration during class\n98:        # initialization during import, but not trigger object creation until\n99:        # actual use (which should not happen until after all imports are\n100:        # finished).\n(82 more lines below)\n(Open file: /sympy__sympy/sympy/core/singleton.py)\n(Current directory: /sympy__sympy)\nbash-$",
