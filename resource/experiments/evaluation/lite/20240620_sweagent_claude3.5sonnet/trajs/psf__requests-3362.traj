If\n58:you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value\n59:pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. ``httpbin.org/get?key=val``.\n60:Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary, using the\n61:``params`` keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass\n62:``key1=value1`` and ``key2=value2`` to ``httpbin.org/get``, you would use the\n63:following code::\n64:\n65:    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n66:    >>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)\n67:\n68:You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL::\n69:\n70:    >>> print(r.url)\n71:    http://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1\n72:\n73:Note that any dictionary key whose value is ``None`` will not be added to the\n74:URL's query string.\n75:\n76:You can also pass a list of items as a value::\n77:\n78:    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': ['value2', 'value3']}\n79:\n80:    >>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)\n81:    >>> print(r.url)\n82:    http://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2&key2=value3\n83:\n84:Response Content\n85:----------------\n86:\n87:We can read the content of the server's response.

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nUncertain about content/text vs iter_content(decode_unicode=True/False)\nWhen requesting an application/json document, I'm seeing `next(r.iter_content(16*1024, decode_unicode=True))` returning bytes, whereas `r.text` returns unicode. My understanding was that both should return a unicode object. In essence, I thought \"iter_content\" was equivalent to \"iter_text\" when decode_unicode was True. Have I misunderstood something? I can provide an example if needed.\n\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want.\nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command.\nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses.\n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n\n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it successfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through.\n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker.\n\n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doesn't work, use the linux 'find' command.\n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n\n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /psf__requests)\nbash-$",

This page gives a good introduction in how to get started\n9:with Requests.\n10:\n11:First, make sure that:\n12:\n13:* Requests is :ref:`installed <install>`\n14:* Requests is :ref:`up-to-date <updates>`\n15:\n16:\n17:Let's get started with some simple examples.\n18:\n19:\n20:Make a Request\n21:--------------\n22:\n23:Making a request with Requests is very simple.\n24:\n25:Begin by importing the Requests module::\n26:\n27:    >>> import requests\n28:\n29:Now, let's try to get a webpage. For this example, let's get GitHub's public\n30:timeline ::\n31:\n32:    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')\n33:\n34:Now, we have a :class:`Response <requests.Response>` object called ``r``. We can\n35:get all the information we need from this object.\n36:\n37:Requests' simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as obvious. For\n38:example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request::\n39:\n40:    >>> r = requests.post('http://httpbin.org/post', data = {'key':'value'})\n41:\n42:Nice, right? What about the other HTTP request types: PUT, DELETE, HEAD and\n43:OPTIONS? These are all just as simple::\n44:\n45:    >>> r = requests.put('http://httpbin.org/put', data = {'key':'value'})\n46:    >>> r = requests.delete('http://httpbin.org/delete')\n47:    >>> r = requests.head('http://httpbin.org/get')\n48:    >>> r = requests.options('http://httpbin.org/get')\n49:\n50:That's all well and good, but it's also only the start of what Requests can\n51:do.\n52:\n53:\n54:Passing Parameters In URLs\n55:--------------------------\n56:\n57:You often want to send some sort of data in the URL's query string. If\n58:you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value\n59:pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. ``httpbin.org/get?key=val``.\n60:Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary, using the\n61:``params`` keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass\n62:``key1=value1`` and ``key2=value2`` to ``httpbin.org/get``, you would use the\n63:following code::\n64:\n65:    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}\n66:    >>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)\n67:\n68:You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL::\n69:\n70:    >>> print(r.url)\n71:    http://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1\n72:\n73:Note that any dictionary key whose value is ``None`` will not be added to the\n74:URL's query string.\n75:\n76:You can also pass a list of items as a value::\n77:\n78:    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': ['value2', 'value3']}\n79:\n80:    >>> r = requests.get('http://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)\n81:    >>> print(r.url)\n82:    http://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2&key2=value3\n83:\n84:Response Content\n85:----------------\n86:\n87:We can read the content of the server's response.

The text encoding guessed by Requests\n101:is used when you access ``r.text``. You can find out what encoding Requests is\n102:using, and change it, using the ``r.encoding`` property::\n103:\n104:    >>> r.encoding\n105:    'utf-8'\n106:    >>> r.encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'\n107:\n108:If you change the encoding, Requests will use the new value of ``r.encoding``\n109:whenever you call ``r.text``. You might want to do this in any situation where\n110:you can apply special logic to work out what the encoding of the content will\n111:be. For example, HTTP and XML have the ability to specify their encoding in\n112:their body. In situations like this, you should use ``r.content`` to find the\n113:encoding, and then set ``r.encoding``. This will let you use ``r.text`` with\n114:the correct encoding.\n115:\n116:Requests will also use custom encodings in the event that you need them. If\n117:you have created your own encoding and registered it with the ``codecs``\n118:module, you can simply use the codec name as the value of ``r.encoding`` and\n119:Requests will handle the decoding for you.\n120:\n121:Binary Response Content\n122:-----------------------\n123:\n124:You can also access the response body as bytes, for non-text requests::\n125:\n126:    >>> r.content\n127:    b'[{\"repository\":{\"open_issues\":0,\"url\":\"https://github.com/...\n128:\n129:The ``gzip`` and ``deflate`` transfer-encodings are automatically decoded for you.\n130:\n131:For example, to create an image from binary data returned by a request, you can\n132:use the following code::\n133:\n134:    >>> from PIL import Image\n135:    >>> from StringIO import StringIO\n136:\n137:    >>> i = Image.open(StringIO(r.content))\n138:\n139:\n140:JSON Response Content\n141:---------------------\n142:\n143:There's also a builtin JSON decoder, in case you're dealing with JSON data::\n144:\n145:    >>> import requests\n146:\n147:    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')\n148:    >>> r.json()\n149:    [{u'repository': {u'open_issues': 0, u'url': 'https://github.com/...\n150:\n151:In case the JSON decoding fails, ``r.json`` raises an exception. For example, if\n152:the response gets a 204 (No Content), or if the response contains invalid JSON,\n153:attempting ``r.json`` raises ``ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded``.\n154:\n155:It should be noted that the success of the call to ``r.json`` does **not**\n156:indicate the success of the response. Some servers may return a JSON object in a\n157:failed response (e.g. error details with HTTP 500). Such JSON will be decoded\n158:and returned. To check that a request is successful, use\n159:``r.raise_for_status()`` or check ``r.status_code`` is what you expect.\n160:\n161:\n162:Raw Response Content\n163:--------------------\n164:\n165:In the rare case that you'd like to get the raw socket response from the\n166:server, you can access ``r.raw``. If you want to do this, make sure you set\n167:``stream=True`` in your initial request.

For example, if\n152:the response gets a 204 (No Content), or if the response contains invalid JSON,\n153:attempting ``r.json`` raises ``ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded``.\n154:\n155:It should be noted that the success of the call to ``r.json`` does **not**\n156:indicate the success of the response. Some servers may return a JSON object in a\n157:failed response (e.g. error details with HTTP 500). Such JSON will be decoded\n158:and returned.

If you want to do this, make sure you set\n167:``stream=True`` in your initial request.
