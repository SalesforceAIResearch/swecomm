# Aider


Aider is a command line tool that lets you pair program with LLMs,
to edit code stored in your local git repository.
Aider will directly edit the code in your local source files,
and [git commit the changes](https://aider.chat/docs/faq.html#how-does-aider-use-git)
with sensible commit messages.
You can start a new project or work with an existing git repo.
Aider is unique in that it lets you ask for changes to [pre-existing, larger codebases](https://aider.chat/docs/repomap.html).
Aider works well with GPT-4o, Claude 3 Opus, GPT-3.5
and supports [connecting to almost any LLM](https://aider.chat/docs/llms.html).
