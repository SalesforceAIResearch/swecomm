Amazon Q Developer Agent for software development (Q Dev Agent) is an AI-powered assistant for
software development that can can autonomously perform a range of tasks â€“ everything from
implementing features, documenting, and refactoring code, to performing software upgrades. The
performance of this development version of Q Dev Agent has been measured against the SWE-bench
dataset. This experimental development version of the service implements more advanced code
navigation, editing, and verification.

Q Dev Agent automatically implements multi-file features, bug fixes, and unit tests in your
Integrated Development Environment's (IDE) workspace using natural language input. After you enter
your query, Q Dev Agent explores your code base to deeply understand the problem, before suggesting
and verifying code changes to resolve the request. Q Dev Agent uses generative AI to deliver
state-of-the-art accuracy for all developers.

Our team is currently working on publishing details of the Q Dev Agent algorithm.
