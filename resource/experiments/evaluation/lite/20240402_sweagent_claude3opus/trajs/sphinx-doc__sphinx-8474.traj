You are\n13:   free to use it for anything you like, e.g. variable names; use the\n14:   :confval:`default_role` config value to set it to a known role -- the\n15:   :rst:role:`any` role to find anything or the :rst:role:`py:obj` role to find\n16:   Python objects are very useful for this.\n17:\n18:See :doc:`/usage/restructuredtext/domains` for roles added by domains.\n19:\n20:\n21:.. _xref-syntax:\n22:\n23:Cross-referencing syntax\n24:------------------------\n25:\n26:Cross-references are generated by many semantic interpreted text roles.\n27:Basically, you only need to write ``:role:`target```, and a link will be\n28:created to the item named *target* of the type indicated by *role*.  The link's\n29:text will be the same as *target*.\n30:\n31:There are some additional facilities, however, that make cross-referencing\n32:roles more versatile:\n33:\n34:* You may supply an explicit title and reference target, like in reST direct\n35:  hyperlinks: ``:role:`title <target>``` will refer to *target*, but the link\n36:  text will be *title*.\n37:\n38:* If you prefix the content with ``!``, no reference/hyperlink will be created.\n39:\n40:* If you prefix the content with ``~``, the link text will only be the last\n41:  component of the target.  For example, ``:py:meth:`~Queue.Queue.get``` will\n42:  refer to ``Queue.Queue.get`` but only display ``get`` as the link text.  This\n43:  does not work with all cross-reference roles, but is domain specific.\n44:\n45:  In HTML output, the link's ``title`` attribute (that is e.g. shown as a\n46:  tool-tip on mouse-hover) will always be the full target name.\n47:\n48:\n49:.. _any-role:\n50:\n51:Cross-referencing anything\n52:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n53:\n54:.. rst:role:: any\n55:\n56:   .. versionadded:: 1.3\n57:\n58:   This convenience role tries to do its best to find a valid target for its\n59:   reference text.\n60:\n61:   * First, it tries standard cross-reference targets that would be referenced\n62:     by :rst:role:`doc`, :rst:role:`ref` or :rst:role:`option`.\n63:\n64:     Custom objects added to the standard domain by extensions (see\n65:     :meth:`.Sphinx.add_object_type`) are also searched.\n66:\n67:   * Then, it looks for objects (targets) in all loaded domains.  It is up to\n68:     the domains how specific a match must be.  For example, in the Python\n69:     domain a reference of ``:any:`Builder``` would match the\n70:     ``sphinx.builders.Builder`` class.\n71:\n72:   If none or multiple targets are found, a warning will be emitted.  In the\n73:   case of multiple targets, you can change \"any\" to a specific role.\n74:\n75:   This role is a good candidate for setting :confval:`default_role`.  If you\n76:   do, you can write cross-references without a lot of markup overhead.  For\n77:   example, in this Python function documentation ::\n78:\n79:      .. function:: install()\n80:\n81:         This function installs a `handler` for every signal known by the\n82:         `signal` module.

Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone as a\n11:documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained deeply\n12:built in -- the most fundamental directives, like ``function``, were designed\n13:for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, interest\n14:developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, JavaScript,\n15:or even reStructuredText markup (like in this documentation).\n16:\n17:While this was always possible, it is now much easier to easily support\n18:documentation of projects using different programming languages or even ones\n19:not supported by the main Sphinx distribution, by providing a **domain** for\n20:every such purpose.\n21:\n22:A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\\ s and\n23::term:`role`\\ s) to describe and link to :term:`object`\\ s belonging together,\n24:e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role names in a domain\n25:have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``.  Domains can also\n26:provide custom indices (like the Python Module Index).\n27:\n28:Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of\n29:documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also means\n30:that extensions that support the documentation of whole new languages are much\n31:easier to write.\n32:\n33:This section describes what the domains that are included with Sphinx provide.\n34:The domain API is documented as well, in the section :ref:`domain-api`.\n35:\n36:\n37:.. _basic-domain-markup:\n38:\n39:Basic Markup\n40:------------\n41:\n42:Most domains provide a number of :dfn:`object description directives`, used to\n43:describe specific objects provided by modules.  Each directive requires one or\n44:more signatures to provide basic information about what is being described, and\n45:the content should be the description.  A domain will typically keep an\n46:internal index of all entites to aid cross-referencing. Typically it will\n47:also add entries in the shown general index.\n48:If you want to suppress the addition of an entry in the shown index, you can\n49:give the directive option flag ``:noindexentry:``.\n50:If you want to typeset an object description, without even making it available\n51:for cross-referencing, you can give the directive option flag ``:noindex:``\n52:(which implies ``:noindexentry:``).\n53:Though, note that not every directive en every domain may support these\n54:options.\n55:\n56:.. versionadded:: 3.2\n57:   The directive option ``noindexentry`` in the Python, C, C++, and Javascript\n58:   domains.\n59:\n60:An example using a Python domain directive::\n61:\n62:   .. py:function:: spam(eggs)\n63:                    ham(eggs)\n64:\n65:      Spam or ham the foo.\n66:\n67:This describes the two Python functions ``spam`` and ``ham``.  (Note that when\n68:signatures become too long, you can break them if you add a backslash to lines\n69:that are continued in the next line.  Example::\n70:\n71:   .. py:function:: filterwarnings(action, message='', category=Warning, \\\n72:                                   module='', lineno=0, append=False)\n73:      :noindex:\n74:\n75:(This example also shows how to use the ``:noindex:`` flag.)\n76:\n77:The domains also provide roles that link back to these object descriptions.\n78:For example, to link to one of the functions described in the example above,\n79:you could say ::\n80:\n81:   The function :py:func:`spam` does a similar thing.\n82:\n83:As you can see, both directive and role names contain the domain name and the\n84:directive name.\n85:\n86:.. rubric:: Default Domain\n87:\n88:For documentation describing objects from solely one domain, authors will not\n89:have to state again its name at each directive, role, etc... after\n90:having specified a default.

While the :confval:`primary_domain` selects a\n96:   global default, this only has an effect within the same file.\n97:\n98:If no other default is selected, the Python domain (named ``py``) is the\n99:default one, mostly for compatibility with documentation written for older\n100:versions of Sphinx.\n(1742 more lines below)\n",

If line_number is provided, the window will be move to include that line\n  signature: open <path> [<line_number>]\n  arguments:\n    - path (string) [required]: the path to the file to open\n    - line_number (integer) [optional]: the line number to move the window to (if not provided, the window will start at the top of the file)\n\ngoto:\n  docstring: moves the window to show <line_number>\n  signature: goto <line_number>\n  arguments:\n    - line_number (integer) [required]: the line number to move the window to\n\nscroll_down:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\nscroll_up:\n  docstring: moves the window down {WINDOW} lines\n  signature: scroll_down\n\ncreate:\n  docstring: creates and opens a new file with the given name\n  signature: create <filename>\n  arguments:\n    - filename (string) [required]: the name of the file to create\n\nsubmit:\n  docstring: submits your current code and terminates the session\n  signature: submit\n\nsearch_dir:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in all files in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file. If file is not provided, searches in the current open file\n  signature: search_file <search_term> [<file>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - file (string) [optional]: the file to search in (if not provided, searches in the current open file)\n\nfind_file:\n  docstring: finds all files with the given name in dir. If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: find_file <file_name> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - file_name (string) [required]: the name of the file to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nedit:\n  docstring: replaces lines <start_line> through <end_line> (inclusive) with the given text in the open file. The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not idented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory. Then maybe we can look at some relevant files to see what they look like.\n<command>\nls -a\n</command>\n\nYou should only include a *SINGLE* command in the command section and then wait for a response from the shell before continuing with more discussion and commands. Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nv3.3 upgrade started generating \"WARNING: no number is assigned for table\" warnings\nWe've updated to Sphinx 3.3 in our documentation, and suddenly the following warning started popping up in our builds when we build either `singlehtml` or `latex`.:\r\n\r\n`WARNING: no number is assigned for table:`\r\n\r\nI looked through the changelog but it didn't seem like there was anything related to `numref` that was changed, but perhaps I missed something? Could anyone point me to a change in the numref logic so I can figure out where these warnings are coming from?\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6.

You are\n13:   free to use it for anything you like, e.g. variable names; use the\n14:   :confval:`default_role` config value to set it to a known role -- the\n15:   :rst:role:`any` role to find anything or the :rst:role:`py:obj` role to find\n16:   Python objects are very useful for this.\n17:\n18:See :doc:`/usage/restructuredtext/domains` for roles added by domains.\n19:\n20:\n21:.. _xref-syntax:\n22:\n23:Cross-referencing syntax\n24:------------------------\n25:\n26:Cross-references are generated by many semantic interpreted text roles.\n27:Basically, you only need to write ``:role:`target```, and a link will be\n28:created to the item named *target* of the type indicated by *role*.  The link's\n29:text will be the same as *target*.\n30:\n31:There are some additional facilities, however, that make cross-referencing\n32:roles more versatile:\n33:\n34:* You may supply an explicit title and reference target, like in reST direct\n35:  hyperlinks: ``:role:`title <target>``` will refer to *target*, but the link\n36:  text will be *title*.\n37:\n38:* If you prefix the content with ``!``, no reference/hyperlink will be created.\n39:\n40:* If you prefix the content with ``~``, the link text will only be the last\n41:  component of the target.  For example, ``:py:meth:`~Queue.Queue.get``` will\n42:  refer to ``Queue.Queue.get`` but only display ``get`` as the link text.  This\n43:  does not work with all cross-reference roles, but is domain specific.\n44:\n45:  In HTML output, the link's ``title`` attribute (that is e.g. shown as a\n46:  tool-tip on mouse-hover) will always be the full target name.\n47:\n48:\n49:.. _any-role:\n50:\n51:Cross-referencing anything\n52:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n53:\n54:.. rst:role:: any\n55:\n56:   .. versionadded:: 1.3\n57:\n58:   This convenience role tries to do its best to find a valid target for its\n59:   reference text.\n60:\n61:   * First, it tries standard cross-reference targets that would be referenced\n62:     by :rst:role:`doc`, :rst:role:`ref` or :rst:role:`option`.\n63:\n64:     Custom objects added to the standard domain by extensions (see\n65:     :meth:`.Sphinx.add_object_type`) are also searched.\n66:\n67:   * Then, it looks for objects (targets) in all loaded domains.  It is up to\n68:     the domains how specific a match must be.  For example, in the Python\n69:     domain a reference of ``:any:`Builder``` would match the\n70:     ``sphinx.builders.Builder`` class.\n71:\n72:   If none or multiple targets are found, a warning will be emitted.  In the\n73:   case of multiple targets, you can change \"any\" to a specific role.\n74:\n75:   This role is a good candidate for setting :confval:`default_role`.  If you\n76:   do, you can write cross-references without a lot of markup overhead.  For\n77:   example, in this Python function documentation ::\n78:\n79:      .. function:: install()\n80:\n81:         This function installs a `handler` for every signal known by the\n82:         `signal` module.  See the section `about-signals` for more information.\n83:\n84:   there could be references to a glossary term (usually ``:term:`handler```), a\n85:   Python module (usually ``:py:mod:`signal``` or ``:mod:`signal```) and a\n86:   section (usually ``:ref:`about-signals```).\n87:\n88:   The :rst:role:`any` role also works together with the\n89:   :mod:`~sphinx.ext.intersphinx` extension: when no local cross-reference is\n90:   found, all object types of intersphinx inventories are also searched.\n91:\n92:Cross-referencing objects\n93:^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n94:\n95:These roles are described with their respective domains:\n96:\n97:* :ref:`Python <python-roles>`\n98:* :ref:`C <c-roles>`\n99:* :ref:`C++ <cpp-roles>`\n100:* :ref:`JavaScript <js-roles>`\n(373 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sphinx-doc__sphinx/doc/usage/restructuredtext/roles.rst)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-doc__sphinx)\nbash-$",

Shortly afterwards, it was made available for everyone as a\n11:documentation tool, but the documentation of Python modules remained deeply\n12:built in -- the most fundamental directives, like ``function``, were designed\n13:for Python objects.  Since Sphinx has become somewhat popular, interest\n14:developed in using it for many different purposes: C/C++ projects, JavaScript,\n15:or even reStructuredText markup (like in this documentation).\n16:\n17:While this was always possible, it is now much easier to easily support\n18:documentation of projects using different programming languages or even ones\n19:not supported by the main Sphinx distribution, by providing a **domain** for\n20:every such purpose.\n21:\n22:A domain is a collection of markup (reStructuredText :term:`directive`\\ s and\n23::term:`role`\\ s) to describe and link to :term:`object`\\ s belonging together,\n24:e.g. elements of a programming language.  Directive and role names in a domain\n25:have names like ``domain:name``, e.g. ``py:function``.  Domains can also\n26:provide custom indices (like the Python Module Index).\n27:\n28:Having domains means that there are no naming problems when one set of\n29:documentation wants to refer to e.g. C++ and Python classes.  It also means\n30:that extensions that support the documentation of whole new languages are much\n31:easier to write.\n32:\n33:This section describes what the domains that are included with Sphinx provide.\n34:The domain API is documented as well, in the section :ref:`domain-api`.\n35:\n36:\n37:.. _basic-domain-markup:\n38:\n39:Basic Markup\n40:------------\n41:\n42:Most domains provide a number of :dfn:`object description directives`, used to\n43:describe specific objects provided by modules.  Each directive requires one or\n44:more signatures to provide basic information about what is being described, and\n45:the content should be the description.  A domain will typically keep an\n46:internal index of all entites to aid cross-referencing. Typically it will\n47:also add entries in the shown general index.\n48:If you want to suppress the addition of an entry in the shown index, you can\n49:give the directive option flag ``:noindexentry:``.\n50:If you want to typeset an object description, without even making it available\n51:for cross-referencing, you can give the directive option flag ``:noindex:``\n52:(which implies ``:noindexentry:``).\n53:Though, note that not every directive en every domain may support these\n54:options.\n55:\n56:.. versionadded:: 3.2\n57:   The directive option ``noindexentry`` in the Python, C, C++, and Javascript\n58:   domains.\n59:\n60:An example using a Python domain directive::\n61:\n62:   .. py:function:: spam(eggs)\n63:                    ham(eggs)\n64:\n65:      Spam or ham the foo.\n66:\n67:This describes the two Python functions ``spam`` and ``ham``.  (Note that when\n68:signatures become too long, you can break them if you add a backslash to lines\n69:that are continued in the next line.  Example::\n70:\n71:   .. py:function:: filterwarnings(action, message='', category=Warning, \\\n72:                                   module='', lineno=0, append=False)\n73:      :noindex:\n74:\n75:(This example also shows how to use the ``:noindex:`` flag.)\n76:\n77:The domains also provide roles that link back to these object descriptions.\n78:For example, to link to one of the functions described in the example above,\n79:you could say ::\n80:\n81:   The function :py:func:`spam` does a similar thing.\n82:\n83:As you can see, both directive and role names contain the domain name and the\n84:directive name.\n85:\n86:.. rubric:: Default Domain\n87:\n88:For documentation describing objects from solely one domain, authors will not\n89:have to state again its name at each directive, role, etc... after\n90:having specified a default. This can be done either via the config\n91:value :confval:`primary_domain` or via this directive:\n92:\n93:.. rst:directive:: .. default-domain:: name\n94:\n95:   Select a new default domain.  While the :confval:`primary_domain` selects a\n96:   global default, this only has an effect within the same file.\n97:\n98:If no other default is selected, the Python domain (named ``py``) is the\n99:default one, mostly for compatibility with documentation written for older\n100:versions of Sphinx.\n(1742 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /sphinx-doc__sphinx/doc/usage/restructuredtext/domains.rst)\n(Current directory: /sphinx-doc__sphinx)\nbash-$",
