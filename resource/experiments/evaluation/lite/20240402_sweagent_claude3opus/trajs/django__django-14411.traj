      "observation": "[File: /django__django/docs/topics/auth/customizing.txt (1181 lines total)]\n1:====================================\n2:Customizing authentication in Django\n3:====================================\n4:\n5:The authentication that comes with Django is good enough for most common cases,\n6:but you may have needs not met by the out-of-the-box defaults. Customizing\n7:authentication in your projects requires understanding what points of the\n8:provided system are extensible or replaceable. This document provides details\n9:about how the auth system can be customized.\n10:\n11::ref:`Authentication backends <authentication-backends>` provide an extensible\n12:system for when a username and password stored with the user model need to be\n13:authenticated against a different service than Django's default.\n14:\n15:You can give your models :ref:`custom permissions <custom-permissions>` that\n16:can be checked through Django's authorization system.\n17:\n18:You can :ref:`extend <extending-user>` the default ``User`` model, or\n19::ref:`substitute <auth-custom-user>` a completely customized model.\n20:\n21:.. _authentication-backends:\n22:\n23:Other authentication sources\n24:============================\n25:\n26:There may be times you have the need to hook into another authentication source\n27:-- that is, another source of usernames and passwords or authentication\n28:methods.\n29:\n30:For example, your company may already have an LDAP setup that stores a username\n31:and password for every employee. It'd be a hassle for both the network\n32:administrator and the users themselves if users had separate accounts in LDAP\n33:and the Django-based applications.\n34:\n35:So, to handle situations like this, the Django authentication system lets you\n36:plug in other authentication sources. You can override Django's default\n37:database-based scheme, or you can use the default system in tandem with other\n38:systems.\n39:\n40:See the :ref:`authentication backend reference\n41:<authentication-backends-reference>` for information on the authentication\n42:backends included with Django.\n43:\n44:Specifying authentication backends\n45:----------------------------------\n46:\n47:Behind the scenes, Django maintains a list of \"authentication backends\" that it\n48:checks for authentication. When somebody calls\n49::func:`django.contrib.auth.authenticate()` -- as described in :ref:`How to log\n50:a user in <how-to-log-a-user-in>` -- Django tries authenticating across\n51:all of its authentication backends. If the first authentication method fails,\n52:Django tries the second one, and so on, until all backends have been attempted.\n53:\n54:The list of authentication backends to use is specified in the\n55::setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting. This should be a list of Python\n56:path names that point to Python classes that know how to authenticate. These\n57:classes can be anywhere on your Python path.\n58:\n59:By default, :setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` is set to::\n60:\n61:    ['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend']\n62:\n63:That's the basic authentication backend that checks the Django users database\n64:and queries the built-in permissions. It does not provide protection against\n65:brute force attacks via any rate limiting mechanism. You may either implement\n66:your own rate limiting mechanism in a custom auth backend, or use the\n67:mechanisms provided by most Web servers.\n68:\n69:The order of :setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` matters, so if the same\n70:username and password is valid in multiple backends, Django will stop\n71:processing at the first positive match.\n72:\n73:If a backend raises a :class:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied`\n74:exception, authentication will immediately fail. Django won't check the\n75:backends that follow.\n76:\n77:.. note::\n78:\n79:    Once a user has authenticated, Django stores which backend was used to\n80:    authenticate the user in the user's session, and re-uses the same backend\n81:    for the duration of that session whenever access to the currently\n82:    authenticated user is needed. This effectively means that authentication\n83:    sources are cached on a per-session basis, so if you change\n84:    :setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, you'll need to clear out session data if\n85:    you need to force users to re-authenticate using different methods. A\n86:    simple way to do that is to execute ``Session.objects.all().delete()``.\n87:\n88:Writing an authentication backend\n89:---------------------------------\n90:\n91:An authentication backend is a class that implements two required methods:\n92:``get_user(user_id)`` and ``authenticate(request, **credentials)``, as well as\n93:a set of optional permission related :ref:`authorization methods\n94:<authorization_methods>`.\n95:\n96:The ``get_user`` method takes a ``user_id`` -- which could be a username,\n97:database ID or whatever, but has to be the primary key of your user object --\n98:and returns a user object or ``None``.\n99:\n100:The ``authenticate`` method takes a ``request`` argument and credentials as\n(1081 more lines below)\n",

If dir is not provided, searches in the current directory\n  signature: search_dir <search_term> [<dir>]\n  arguments:\n    - search_term (string) [required]: the term to search for\n    - dir (string) [optional]: the directory to search in (if not provided, searches in the current directory)\n\nsearch_file:\n  docstring: searches for search_term in file.

The replacement text is terminated by a line with only end_of_edit on it. All of the <replacement text> will be entered, so make sure your indentation is formatted properly. Python files will be checked for syntax errors after the edit. If the system detects a syntax error, the edit will not be executed. Simply try to edit the file again, but make sure to read the error message and modify the edit command you issue accordingly. Issuing the same command a second time will just lead to the same error message again.\n  signature: edit <start_line>:<end_line>\n<replacement_text>\nend_of_edit\n  arguments:\n    - start_line (integer) [required]: the line number to start the edit at\n    - end_line (integer) [required]: the line number to end the edit at (inclusive)\n    - replacement_text (string) [required]: the text to replace the current selection with\n\n\n\nPlease note that THE EDIT COMMAND REQUIRES PROPER INDENTATION. \nIf you'd like to add the line '        print(x)' you must fully write that out, with all those spaces before the code! Indentation is important and code that is not idented correctly will fail and require fixing before it can be run.\n\nRESPONSE FORMAT:\nYour shell prompt is formatted as follows:\n(Open file: <path>) <cwd> $\n\nYou need to format your output using two fields; discussion and command.\nYour output should always include _one_ discussion and _one_ command field EXACTLY as in the following example:\nDISCUSSION\nFirst I'll start by using ls to see what files are in the current directory.

Everything you include in the DISCUSSION section will be saved for future reference.\nIf you'd like to issue two commands at once, PLEASE DO NOT DO THAT! Please instead first submit just the first command, and then after receiving a response you'll be able to issue the second command. \nYou're free to use any other bash commands you want (e.g. find, grep, cat, ls, cd) in addition to the special commands listed above.\nHowever, the environment does NOT support interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim), so please do not invoke them.",

      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nLabel for ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget points to non-labelable element.\nDescription\n\t \n\t\t(last modified by David Sanders)\n\t \nIn the admin, the label element for the ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget widget has a 'for' attribute which points to a non-labelable element, since the widget just renders text, not an input. There's no labelable element for the widget, so the label shouldn't have a 'for' attribute.\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$",

Customizing\n7:authentication in your projects requires understanding what points of the\n8:provided system are extensible or replaceable. This document provides details\n9:about how the auth system can be customized.\n10:\n11::ref:`Authentication backends <authentication-backends>` provide an extensible\n12:system for when a username and password stored with the user model need to be\n13:authenticated against a different service than Django's default.\n14:\n15:You can give your models :ref:`custom permissions <custom-permissions>` that\n16:can be checked through Django's authorization system.\n17:\n18:You can :ref:`extend <extending-user>` the default ``User`` model, or\n19::ref:`substitute <auth-custom-user>` a completely customized model.\n20:\n21:.. _authentication-backends:\n22:\n23:Other authentication sources\n24:============================\n25:\n26:There may be times you have the need to hook into another authentication source\n27:-- that is, another source of usernames and passwords or authentication\n28:methods.\n29:\n30:For example, your company may already have an LDAP setup that stores a username\n31:and password for every employee. It'd be a hassle for both the network\n32:administrator and the users themselves if users had separate accounts in LDAP\n33:and the Django-based applications.\n34:\n35:So, to handle situations like this, the Django authentication system lets you\n36:plug in other authentication sources. You can override Django's default\n37:database-based scheme, or you can use the default system in tandem with other\n38:systems.\n39:\n40:See the :ref:`authentication backend reference\n41:<authentication-backends-reference>` for information on the authentication\n42:backends included with Django.\n43:\n44:Specifying authentication backends\n45:----------------------------------\n46:\n47:Behind the scenes, Django maintains a list of \"authentication backends\" that it\n48:checks for authentication. When somebody calls\n49::func:`django.contrib.auth.authenticate()` -- as described in :ref:`How to log\n50:a user in <how-to-log-a-user-in>` -- Django tries authenticating across\n51:all of its authentication backends. If the first authentication method fails,\n52:Django tries the second one, and so on, until all backends have been attempted.\n53:\n54:The list of authentication backends to use is specified in the\n55::setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` setting. This should be a list of Python\n56:path names that point to Python classes that know how to authenticate. These\n57:classes can be anywhere on your Python path.\n58:\n59:By default, :setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` is set to::\n60:\n61:    ['django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend']\n62:\n63:That's the basic authentication backend that checks the Django users database\n64:and queries the built-in permissions. It does not provide protection against\n65:brute force attacks via any rate limiting mechanism. You may either implement\n66:your own rate limiting mechanism in a custom auth backend, or use the\n67:mechanisms provided by most Web servers.\n68:\n69:The order of :setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS` matters, so if the same\n70:username and password is valid in multiple backends, Django will stop\n71:processing at the first positive match.\n72:\n73:If a backend raises a :class:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied`\n74:exception, authentication will immediately fail. Django won't check the\n75:backends that follow.\n76:\n77:.. note::\n78:\n79:    Once a user has authenticated, Django stores which backend was used to\n80:    authenticate the user in the user's session, and re-uses the same backend\n81:    for the duration of that session whenever access to the currently\n82:    authenticated user is needed. This effectively means that authentication\n83:    sources are cached on a per-session basis, so if you change\n84:    :setting:`AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`, you'll need to clear out session data if\n85:    you need to force users to re-authenticate using different methods. A\n86:    simple way to do that is to execute ``Session.objects.all().delete()``.\n87:\n88:Writing an authentication backend\n89:---------------------------------\n90:\n91:An authentication backend is a class that implements two required methods:\n92:``get_user(user_id)`` and ``authenticate(request, **credentials)``, as well as\n93:a set of optional permission related :ref:`authorization methods\n94:<authorization_methods>`.\n95:\n96:The ``get_user`` method takes a ``user_id`` -- which could be a username,\n97:database ID or whatever, but has to be the primary key of your user object --\n98:and returns a user object or ``None``.\n99:\n100:The ``authenticate`` method takes a ``request`` argument and credentials as\n(1081 more lines below)\n\n(Open file: /django__django/docs/topics/auth/customizing.txt)\n(Current directory: /django__django)\nbash-$",
