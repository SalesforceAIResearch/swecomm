      "content": "We're currently solving the following issue within our repository. Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\nTimeDelta serialization precision\nHi there!\n\nI just found quite strange behaviour of `TimeDelta` field serialization\n\n```python3\nfrom marshmallow.fields import TimeDelta\nfrom datetime import timedelta\n\ntd_field = TimeDelta(precision=\"milliseconds\")\n\nobj = dict()\nobj[\"td_field\"] = timedelta(milliseconds=345)\n\nprint(td_field.serialize(\"td_field\", obj))\n```\n\nOutput of this snippet is `344`, but it seems that `345` is correct.\n\nLooks like a rounding issue here: https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/blob/dev/src/marshmallow/fields.py#L1474\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /marshmallow-code__marshmallow)\nbash-$",

Here's the issue text:\nISSUE:\n[Bug]: Setting matplotlib.pyplot.style.library['seaborn-colorblind'] result in key error on matplotlib v3.6.1\n### Bug summary\n\nI have code that executes:\r\n```\r\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nthe_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing version 3.4.3 of matplotlib, this works fine. I recently installed my code on a machine with matplotlib version 3.6.1 and upon importing my code, this generated a key error for line `the_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]` saying \"seaborn-colorblind\" was a bad key.\n\n### Code for reproduction\n\n```python\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\r\nthe_rc = plt.style.library[\"seaborn-colorblind\"]\n```\n\n\n### Actual outcome\n\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\nKeyError: 'seaborn-colorblind'\n\n### Expected outcome\n\nseaborn-colorblind should be set as the matplotlib library style and I should be able to continue plotting with that style.\n\n### Additional information\n\n- Bug occurs with matplotlib version 3.6.1\r\n- Bug does not occur with matplotlib version 3.4.3\r\n- Tested on MacOSX and Ubuntu (same behavior on both)\n\n### Operating system\n\nOS/X\n\n### Matplotlib Version\n\n3.6.1\n\n### Matplotlib Backend\n\nMacOSX\n\n### Python version\n\n3.9.7\n\n### Jupyter version\n\n_No response_\n\n### Installation\n\npip\n\n\nINSTRUCTIONS:\nNow, you're going to solve this issue on your own. Your terminal session has started and you're in the repository's root directory. You can use any bash commands or the special interface to help you. Edit all the files you need to and run any checks or tests that you want. \nRemember, YOU CAN ONLY ENTER ONE COMMAND AT A TIME. You should always wait for feedback after every command. \nWhen you're satisfied with all of the changes you've made, you can submit your changes to the code base by simply running the submit command.\nNote however that you cannot use any interactive session commands (e.g. python, vim) in this environment, but you can write scripts and run them. E.g. you can write a python script and then run it with `python <script_name>.py`.\n\nNOTE ABOUT THE EDIT COMMAND: Indentation really matters! When editing a file, make sure to insert appropriate indentation before each line!\n\nIMPORTANT TIPS:\n1. Always start by trying to replicate the bug that the issues discusses. \n   If the issue includes code for reproducing the bug, we recommend that you re-implement that in your environment, and run it to make sure you can reproduce the bug.\n   Then start trying to fix it.\n   When you think you've fixed the bug, re-run the bug reproduction script to make sure that the bug has indeed been fixed.\n   \n   If the bug reproduction script does not print anything when it succesfully runs, we recommend adding a print(\"Script completed successfully, no errors.\") command at the end of the file,\n   so that you can be sure that the script indeed ran fine all the way through. \n\n2. If you run a command and it doesn't work, try running a different command. A command that did not work once will not work the second time unless you modify it!\n\n3. If you open a file and need to get to an area around a specific line that is not in the first 100 lines, say line 583, don't just use the scroll_down command multiple times. Instead, use the goto 583 command. It's much quicker. \n   \n4. If the bug reproduction script requires inputting/reading a specific file, such as buggy-input.png, and you'd like to understand how to input that file, conduct a search in the existing repo code, to see whether someone else has already done that. Do this by running the command: find_file \"buggy-input.png\" If that doensn't work, use the linux 'find' command. \n\n5. Always make sure to look at the currently open file and the current working directory (which appears right after the currently open file). The currently open file might be in a different directory than the working directory! Note that some commands, such as 'create', open files, so they might change the current  open file.\n\n6. When editing files, it is easy to accidentally specify a wrong line number or to write code with incorrect indentation. Always check the code after you issue an edit to make sure that it reflects what you wanted to accomplish. If it didn't, issue another command to fix it.\n   \n\n(Open file: n/a)\n(Current directory: /matplotlib__matplotlib)\nbash-$",

Due\n16:to technical issues, ``matplotlib.cbook.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning`` and\n17:``matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation`` did not raise deprecation warnings on use.\n18:Changes in Python have now made it possible to warn when these aliases are\n19:being used.\n20:\n21:In order to avoid downstream breakage, these aliases will now warn, and their\n22:removal has been pushed from 3.6 to 3.8 to give time to notice said warnings.\n23:As replacement, please use `matplotlib.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning`.\n24:\n25:``Axes`` subclasses should override ``clear`` instead of ``cla``\n26:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n27:\n28:For clarity, `.axes.Axes.clear` is now preferred over `.Axes.cla`. However, for\n29:backwards compatibility, the latter will remain as an alias for the former.\n30:\n31:For additional compatibility with third-party libraries, Matplotlib will\n32:continue to call the ``cla`` method of any `~.axes.Axes` subclasses if they\n33:define it. In the future, this will no longer occur, and Matplotlib will only\n34:call the ``clear`` method in `~.axes.Axes` subclasses.\n35:\n36:It is recommended to define only the ``clear`` method when on Matplotlib 3.6,\n37:and only ``cla`` for older versions.\n38:\n39:Pending deprecation top-level cmap registration and access functions in ``mpl.cm``\n40:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n41:\n42:As part of a `multi-step process\n43:<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20853>`_ we are refactoring\n44:the global state for managing the registered colormaps.\n45:\n46:In Matplotlib 3.5 we added a `.ColormapRegistry` class and exposed an instance\n47:at the top level as ``matplotlib.colormaps``. The existing top level functions\n48:in `matplotlib.cm` (``get_cmap``, ``register_cmap``, ``unregister_cmap``) were\n49:changed to be aliases around the same instance.\n50:\n51:In Matplotlib 3.6 we have marked those top level functions as pending\n52:deprecation with the intention of deprecation in Matplotlib 3.7. The following\n53:functions have been marked for pending deprecation:\n54:\n55:- ``matplotlib.cm.get_cmap``; use ``matplotlib.colormaps[name]`` instead if you\n56:  have a `str`.\n57:\n58:  **Added 3.6.1** Use `matplotlib.cm.ColormapRegistry.get_cmap` if you\n59:  have a string, `None` or a `matplotlib.colors.Colormap` object that you want\n60:  to convert to a `matplotlib.colors.Colormap` instance.\n61:- ``matplotlib.cm.register_cmap``; use `matplotlib.colormaps.register\n62:  <.ColormapRegistry.register>` instead\n63:- ``matplotlib.cm.unregister_cmap``; use `matplotlib.colormaps.unregister\n64:  <.ColormapRegistry.unregister>` instead\n65:- ``matplotlib.pyplot.register_cmap``; use `matplotlib.colormaps.register\n66:  <.ColormapRegistry.register>` instead\n67:\n68:The `matplotlib.pyplot.get_cmap` function will stay available for backward\n69:compatibility.\n70:\n71:Pending deprecation of layout methods\n72:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n73:\n74:The methods `~.Figure.set_tight_layout`, `~.Figure.set_constrained_layout`, are\n75:discouraged, and now emit a `PendingDeprecationWarning` in favor of explicitly\n76:referencing the layout engine via ``figure.set_layout_engine('tight')`` and\n77:``figure.set_layout_engine('constrained')``. End users should not see the\n78:warning, but library authors should adjust.\n79:\n80:The methods `~.Figure.set_constrained_layout_pads` and\n81:`~.Figure.get_constrained_layout_pads` are will be deprecated in favor of\n82:``figure.get_layout_engine().set()`` and ``figure.get_layout_engine().get()``,\n83:and currently emit a `PendingDeprecationWarning`.\n84:\n85:seaborn styles renamed\n86:~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n87:\n88:Matplotlib currently ships many style files inspired from the seaborn library\n89:(\"seaborn\", \"seaborn-bright\", \"seaborn-colorblind\", etc.) but they have gone\n90:out of sync with the library itself since the release of seaborn 0.9.
