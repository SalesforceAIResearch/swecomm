**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

BoundWidget.id_for_label ignores id set by ChoiceWidget.options
Description
	
If you look at the implementation of BoundField.subwidgets
class BoundField:
	...
	def subwidgets(self):
		id_ = self.field.widget.attrs.get('id') or self.auto_id
		attrs = {'id': id_} if id_ else {}
		attrs = self.build_widget_attrs(attrs)
		return [
			BoundWidget(self.field.widget, widget, self.form.renderer)
			for widget in self.field.widget.subwidgets(self.html_name, self.value(), attrs=attrs)
		]
one sees that self.field.widget.subwidgets(self.html_name, self.value(), attrs=attrs) returns a dict and assigns it to widget. Now widget['attrs']['id'] contains the "id" we would like to use when rendering the label of our CheckboxSelectMultiple.
However BoundWidget.id_for_label() is impleme... (1682)
