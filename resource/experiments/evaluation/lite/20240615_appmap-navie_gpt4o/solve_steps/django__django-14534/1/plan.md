**Title**: Update `BoundWidget.id_for_label` to use id set by `ChoiceWidget.options`

**Problem**:
The `BoundWidget.id_for_label` method currently ignores the 'id' attribute set in `widget['attrs']['id']` returned by `ChoiceWidget.options`, instead it re-creates the 'id' in a different format. This results in an unexpected and potentially incorrect 'id' attribute when rendering labels for sub-widgets like `CheckboxSelectMultiple`.

**Analysis**:
The root of the issue lies in the mismatch between how the 'id' is constructed in the `BoundWidget` class versus how it's created and expected to be used by `ChoiceWidget.options`. Currently, `BoundWidget.id_for_label` generates a new 'id' in the format "id_{name}_{index}", which does not utilize the 'id' already included in `widget['attrs']['id']`.

The expectation is that the `id_for_label` method should utilize the 'id' provided by `widget['attrs']['id']` to ensure consistency, especially under conditions where the `auto_id` argument is overridden when initializing a form.

To fix the issue, the `id_for_label` method in the `BoundWidget` class should fetch and use the 'id' from `self.data['attrs']['id']` rather than generating a new one. 

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/forms/boundfield.py`
    - **Function**: `BoundWidget.id_for_label`
    - **Modification**: Change the implementation of `id_for_label` to return `self.data['attrs']['id']` instead of constructing a new 'id'.
   
   Current Code:
    

   Updated Code:
    

This change will ensure that the `id_for_label` method uses the 'id' specified in the `attrs` dictionary of the sub-widget, thereby maintaining consistency and expected behavior, particularly when the `auto_id` format string is overridden.
