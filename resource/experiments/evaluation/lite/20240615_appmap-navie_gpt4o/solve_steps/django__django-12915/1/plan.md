**Title**: Add `get_response_async` method to `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` in Django

**Problem**: 
The `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` in Django is missing an asynchronous version of the `get_response` method, leading to an error when trying to handle static files asynchronously. The error traceback indicates that the `get_response_async` method, which is referenced in the call stack, is not implemented in the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`. This results in a `TypeError` where a `NoneType` object (the missing method) is not callable.

**Analysis**:
`ASGIStaticFilesHandler` extends the ASGI handler in Django and is responsible for serving static files in an ASGI-compatible application. The dispatching logic for handling requests asynchronously is essential to match both WSGI and ASGI call patterns. The snippet provided indicates that the base handler class already supports asynchronous methods. It appears the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` needs to implement a compatible `get_response_async` method to handle asynchronous requests correctly.

To resolve the issue, the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` should:
1. Implement an asynchronous `get_response_async` method that mirrors the synchronous `get_response` process but is adapted for asynchronous execution.
2. Ensure the method correctly chains middleware processing and handles exceptions.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py`
   - **Function to Add**: `get_response_async`
   - **Description**:
     - Create an asynchronous version of the `get_response` process.
     - Use the existing `_get_response_async` logic from `BaseHandler` to correctly handle ASGI requests through middleware and view resolution.



These changes ensure that `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` can correctly handle asynchronous static file requests, thus eliminating the `TypeError` and supporting asynchronous middleware and views seamlessly.
