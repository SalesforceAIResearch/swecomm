**Title**: Implement `get_response_async` in `ASGIStaticFilesHandler`

**Problem**:
The `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` is missing the `get_response_async` function, which results in a traceback exception when using the ASGIStaticFilesHandler. Specifically, the error `'NoneType' object is not callable` occurs when trying to get the async response.

**Analysis**:
The root of the problem lies in the fact that the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` lacks the `get_response_async` method. This method is crucial for handling asynchronous requests. Without it, the ASGI handler defaults to an incomplete middleware chain that leads to the `NoneType` error.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File to Modify**: `django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py`
   
   **Changes**:
   - Add an asynchronous version of the `get_response` method named `get_response_async`.
   - Implement the logic to resolve and call the view, apply view, exception, and template response middleware asynchronously as seen in `get_response` but adapted for async.

2. **Implementation Detail**:
   - Add the `get_response_async` method in the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin`.
   - Ensure that this method adheres to the process of setting up the URL resolver, invoking middleware, handling exceptions, and rendering responses asynchronously.

The implementation should follow the structure found in `django/core/handlers/base.py` for `get_response_async` but adapted to handle static files as required.

Here's a step-by-step description:

1. **Define `get_response_async` Method**:
   - Add the method in `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` which will closely follow the structure of the synchronous `get_response`, but will use `await` for asynchronous calls.

2. **Within `get_response_async` Method**:
   - Set up the default URL resolver using `set_urlconf`.
   - Retrieve the response from `_middleware_chain` asynchronously.
   - Append any necessary resource closures.
   - Handle any exceptions by logging responses if status code >= 400.
   - Return the async response.

By implementing the above changes, we ensure the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` can properly manage asynchronous requests and avoid the `NoneType` callable error.
