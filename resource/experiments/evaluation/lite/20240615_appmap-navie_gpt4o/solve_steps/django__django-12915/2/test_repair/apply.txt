Based on the provided issue description and the context, it seems that the test error (`ImportError: No module named 'staticfiles_tests.test_handlers'`) is due to a missing module in the test definition. We need to ensure the test module and its path are correctly imported.

Let's locate the test definition in `tests/handlers/tests_custom_error_handlers.py` and fix the module import error.

### Change 1:
Update the URL override in the test definition to point to the correct module (`staticfiles_tests`) instead of `handlers.tests_custom_error_handlers`.

```xml

```

### Change 2:
Additionally, make sure all handler imports also correctly reference their modules:

```xml

```

### Apply Both Changes:
Ensure to apply both changes to maintain consistency across imports and settings.

---

Here are both changes in the required format:

```xml



```

By implementing these changes, the modules for tests should be correctly resolved, and the error should be addressed.
