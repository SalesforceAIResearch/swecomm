**Title**: Add `get_response_async` Method to ASGIStaticFilesHandler

**Problem**: 
The `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` is missing an asynchronous response function (`get_response_async`). Without this function, attempting to use `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` results in a `'NoneType' object is not callable` error.

**Analysis**:
The `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` inherits from `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` and `ASGIHandler`. `ASGIHandler` provides the `get_response_async` method, which is responsible for handling asynchronous responses. However, because `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` does not implement `get_response_async`, the inherited method from `ASGIHandler` is not utilized correctly in the mixin-based subclass. 

This causes the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` to fail during the response phase as no asynchronous response handler is present. Adding `get_response_async` to `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` and ensuring it correctly processes static file requests asynchronously will resolve this issue.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Add get_response_async to StaticFilesHandlerMixin**:
    - Implement the `get_response_async` method in the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` to handle static file requests asynchronously.
    - Ensure the method delegates to the existing `get_response_async` method in `ASGIHandler` after checking for static files.

2. **Modify Existing Methods (if necessary)**:
    - Ensure that any other methods interacting with `get_response_async` properly handle the introduction of this method in the static files context.

**Files to Modify**:
1. `django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py`:
    - Add the `get_response_async` method to the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` or `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` class.
    - Ensure that the new method correctly checks for static files and delegates appropriately.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. **django/contrib/staticfiles/handlers.py**
    - In the `StaticFilesHandlerMixin` class (or directly in the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` if appropriate):
    
      Add a new `get_response_async` method:
      - This method should first check if the request targets a static file.
      - If it does, handle the request asynchronously and return the appropriate static file response.
      - If it does not, delegate to `get_response_async` from the `ASGIHandler` class to handle non-static requests.

By implementing these changes, the `ASGIStaticFilesHandler` will appropriately support asynchronous processing, eliminating the `'NoneType' object is not callable` error and enabling correct handling of static files in an ASGI context.
