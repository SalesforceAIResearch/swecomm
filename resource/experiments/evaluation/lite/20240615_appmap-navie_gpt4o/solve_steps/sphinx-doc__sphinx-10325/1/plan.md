### Title
Enhance `:inherited-members:` Option to Support Blacklist of Base Classes

### Problem
The current `:inherited-members:` option in the `automodule` directive does not allow for the exclusion of specific base classes' members when documenting inherited members. This limitation causes issues when you want to selectively ignore members inherited from some base classes in either of the following scenarios:
1. A class inherits from multiple base classes, but you only want to include members from specific base classes.
2. A module contains several class definitions that inherit from common built-in collections (like `list`, `set`, `tuple`), and you want to ignore members from these built-ins but include other inherited members.

### Analysis
To address this issue, we need to enhance the `:inherited-members:` option so that it accepts a list of base classes to ignore when documenting inherited members. This enhancement involves modifying the logic where inherited members are collected and filtered in the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` module.

### Proposed Changes
The core changes will be implemented in `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`. Hereâ€™s a detailed description of what needs to be modified:

1. **Modify the `get_members` function**:
   - Update the function signature to accept an additional parameter for ignored base classes.
   - Before adding a member from an inherited class, check if that class is in the list of ignored base classes.
   
2. **Update `get_class_members` function**:
   - Enhance this function to skip members from the ignored base classes.

3. **Modify the logic in `scan` and `generate` methods**:
   - Update the scanning logic to handle the new format of `:inherited-members:` which will now accept a list of base classes to ignore.

#### Example Update
- **sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py**:
  

4. **Update the documentation generator to pass the ignored classes correctly**:
   - When processing `automodule` and `autoclass` directives, ensure that the ignored base classes are passed to the `get_members` function.
   - Adjust the directive parsing logic to support lists of class names instead of a boolean flag.

By implementing these changes, the enhanced `:inherited-members:` option will provide the requested functionality and offer more flexibility in generating documentation for complex class hierarchies.
