### Add Support for Ignoring Specific Base Classes in `:inherited-members:`

**Problem:**
The current functionality for the `:inherited-members:` option in the `automodule` directive does not allow for fine-grained control over which base classes have their members included in the generated documentation. 

This is problematic in two situations:
1. A class inherits from multiple other classes, and the user wants to document members from some base classes but ignore others.
2. A module contains several classes that inherit from specific base classes (e.g., `list`, `set`, `tuple`) and the user wishes to ignore members from these base classes while documenting all other inherited members in the module.

**Analysis:**
To enable this functionality, the `:inherited-members:` option should accept a list of class names. When generating the documentation, these class names will be used to filter out members inherited from the specified classes. The logic for handling this will need to be integrated into parts of the codebase where the `:inherited-members:` option is processed for both the `automodule` and `autoclass` directives.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **Update Option Specification and Parsing:**
   Update the option specification for the `:inherited-members:` in both `automodule` and `autoclass` directives to accept a list of class names. This will involve changes in files where these directives are defined and initialized.

   **Files to be modified:**
   - `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`: Specific locations where `Options` for `:inherited-members:` are declared and parsed.

   **Changes:**
   - Modify the `option_spec` for the directives to accept list inputs.
   - Parse the list of class names within the directive processing.

2. **Extend Logic to Filter Members:**
   Extend the existing logic that handles inherited members to filter based on the provided list of base classes. Modify the member collection and filtering functions to skip members if they belong to any of the specified ignore classes.

   **Files to be modified:**
   - `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`: Functions such as `get_class_members` and `get_module_members`.

   **Changes:**
   - Update the filtering logic to check if an inherited memberâ€™s base class is in the list of classes to be ignored.
   - Ensure that this logic is applied recursively if needed.

3. **Modify `InheritanceGraph` and Related Functions:**
   Ensure that the `InheritanceGraph` in `sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py` respects the new `:inherited-members:` options when traversing the class hierarchy to build inheritance diagrams.
   
   **Files to be modified:**
   - `sphinx/ext/inheritance_diagram.py`: Functions such as `_class_info`, `recurse`, and `class_name`.

   **Changes:**
   - Update the logic in `_class_info` to skip adding nodes and edges for ignored classes.
   - Update the `recurse` function to avoid further traversing into ignored base classes.
      
4. **Finalization and Validation:**
   Validate that the inheritance diagrams and the `automodule` and `autoclass` directives correctly include or exclude inherited members as per the specified list. Conduct thorough testing to ensure no regressions or unintended behavior changes.
   
After implementing these changes, users will be able to specify a list of class names in the `:inherited-members:` option to selectively include or exclude inherited members from their documentation.

Note: Ensure that the documentation for `sphinx.ext.autodoc` and related modules is updated to reflect the new functionality, providing examples and usage guidelines for users.
