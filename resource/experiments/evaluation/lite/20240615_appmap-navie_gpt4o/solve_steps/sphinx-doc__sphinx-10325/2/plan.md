### Title
Add support for filtering inherited members based on a list of classes in the `:inherited-members:` option

### Problem
The current `:inherited-members:` option in the `automodule` directive does not allow users to selectively document members from specific base classes while ignoring others. This limitation is problematic in two scenarios:

1. A class inherits from multiple other classes, and the user wants to document members from some base classes but exclude others.
2. A module contains various class definitions inheriting from common built-in classes like `list`, `set`, or `tuple`, and the user wants to ignore members from these built-in classes while documenting all other inherited members in the module's classes.

### Analysis
To address this issue, we need to enhance the `:inherited-members:` option to accept a list of classes. These classes will be used to filter out unwanted inherited members during the documentation generation process. The feature should:
- Maintain backward compatibility with the existing boolean behavior of the `:inherited-members:` option.
- Allow a list of class names or class objects that will be checked against the base classes of each class member being documented.
- Ignore the members from the specified base classes while documenting other inherited members.

### Proposed Changes
#### File: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`

1. **Enhance the existing handling of the `:inherited-members:` option**:
   - Modify the logic that processes the `:inherited-members:` option to support both boolean values and lists of class names.
2. **Adjust the logic that retrieves class members**:
   - Update the existing method that collects inherited members to filter out members from specific base classes if a list of classes is provided in the `:inherited-members:` option.

**Suggested changes in detail**:
1. **Modify the `add_directive_header` method** in the `autodoc` module to parse the `:inherited-members:` option:
   - If the option is a list, convert it into a format that can be used to filter class members.
   - Example: `self.options.get('inherited-members', False)`

2. **Adjust the member retrieval method** to support filtering inherited members:
   - Update the `get_class_members` function to check if the `inherited-members` is a list.
     - If it is a list, iterate through each base class and exclude members from the specified base classes.

### Example:
Let's assume we have a module `example_module.py` with the following classes:



**To document the module ignoring inherited members from `list` and `set` classes**:


This configuration would document `method_a`, `method_b`, and `method_d` while ignoring `method_c` (inherited from `list`). 

By implementing these changes, the `:inherited-members:` option in `automodule` will be more flexible and capable of addressing the user's requirements without redundant and tedious workarounds.
