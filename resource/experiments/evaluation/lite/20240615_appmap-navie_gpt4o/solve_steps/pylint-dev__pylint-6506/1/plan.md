**Title:** Handle Unrecognized Options Gracefully Without Traceback

**Problem:** When an unrecognized option is passed to pylint, it prints a traceback. This traceback is not user-friendly and should be replaced with a more informative error message similar to how `mypy` handles unrecognized arguments.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the problem lies in the `_config_initialization` function found in `config_initialization.py`. This function raises an `_UnrecognizedOptionError` when it encounters an unrecognized option. The associated traceback is displayed due to the exception not being handled appropriately within `run_pylint`.

The logic should be modified to catch the `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exception and display a user-friendly message indicating the unrecognized option without the traceback. This can be achieved by modifying the `run_pylint` function to include exception handling for `_UnrecognizedOptionError`.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Modify `pylint/__init__.py` File:**
   - Update the `run_pylint` function to include a try-except block to catch `_UnrecognizedOptionError`.
   - Handle the exception by printing an informative error message and exiting gracefully.

### Detailed Description of Changes:

***File: `pylint/__init__.py`***

- **Function:** `run_pylint`
  
  **Change Description:**
  Add a try-except block around the call to `PylintRun` to catch `_UnrecognizedOptionError` and print a user-friendly error message without the traceback.

  **Suggested Changes:**
  - Import the `_UnrecognizedOptionError` exception from `pylint.config.exceptions`.
  - Wrap the call to `PylintRun` in a try-except block.
  - In the except block, handle `_UnrecognizedOptionError` by printing an error message and exiting without error code traceback.

With this change, running `pylint` with an unrecognized option will result in a clean error message instead of a traceback, improving overall user experience.

This approach ensures minimal code changes while effectively resolving the issue and maintaining code readability.
