### Fix AttributeError in matplotlib 3.7.1 with mplcursor on Data Selection

---

#### Problem

When combining `mplcursor` with `matplotlib` 3.7.1 and interacting with the plot (such as clicking on data points), an `AttributeError` is raised, specifically when the `canvas.mpl_disconnect` method is called on a `NoneType` object. This issue does not arise in versions of `matplotlib` 3.7.0 or lower.

---

#### Analysis

The root cause of the issue lies in the handling of `canvas` attributes for the `OffsetBox` class in the `matplotlib.offsetbox` module. When a data point is clicked multiple times, the `ref_artist` might already be detached from its `figure`, resulting in the `figure` attribute being `None`, hence leading to the error when trying to access `canvas`.

The attribute `canvas` is a property that tries to derive `canvas` from `ref_artist.figure.canvas`. If `ref_artist.figure` is `None`, this will raise the reported `AttributeError`.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the `ref_artist.figure` is valid before accessing the `canvas`.

#### Proposed Changes

**File to modify**: `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`

1. **Add a null-check in the `canvas` property**: Update the method to verify if `ref_artist.figure` is valid before attempting to access `canvas`.

**Detailed Changes**:

- **Current Implementation**:

  

- **Proposed Implementation**:

  

**Explanation**: 

- This change ensures that before accessing `figure.canvas`, the code checks if `figure` is not `None`. If `figure` is `None`, it simply returns `None`, preventing the `AttributeError`.

#### Final Notes

- This solution minimizes the code change to a single file, which is the most relevant.

- Ensure to test this modification thoroughly, especially with the reproduction script and scenarios, to verify that the issue is resolved.

- The proposed solution does not affect the logic downstream and maintains the overall functionality of the `OffsetBox` class.

By implementing this change, we mitigate the AttributeError and ensure `mplcursor` works seamlessly with `matplotlib` 3.7.1 across different platforms and interaction scenarios.
