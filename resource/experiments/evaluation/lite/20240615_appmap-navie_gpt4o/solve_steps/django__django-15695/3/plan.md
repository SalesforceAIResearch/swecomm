**Title**: Fix RenameIndex to Properly Restore Old Auto-Generated Name for Unique_Together Indexes

**Problem**:
The `RenameIndex` operation crashes when an unnamed index related to `unique_together` constraints moves backward and forward. It fails to restore the old auto-generated index name when the same `RenameIndex` operation is reapplied, resulting in a `ProgrammingError` on PostgreSQL indicating that the relation already exists.

**Analysis**:
The crux of the issue lies in the `database_backwards` method of the `RenameIndex` operation, which doesn't correctly handle the case where the original index name needs to be restored when moving backward. Instead, it should track and revert to the previous auto-generated index name. Currently, reapplying the `RenameIndex` operation crashes because it tries to re-create an index with the same name that already exists.

To resolve this, changes need to be made to ensure the old auto-generated index name is tracked and restored during the backward operation, allowing the `RenameIndex` to reapply without conflicts.

**Proposed Changes**:
Make changes in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` to correctly handle the backward renaming of indexes.

1. Modify the `database_backwards` method of `RenameIndex`:
   - Ensure old and new names are swapped appropriately.
   - Restore the old auto-generated index name when moving backward.
   - Track the original index name before altering it.

2. Ensure the `database_forwards` logic is not affected but complement the backward operation enhancements.

**Detailed Change**:

1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`

 - **Function**: `database_backwards` in `RenameIndex` class

   - Swap the names such that the operation tracks the previous name using a helper method or inline logic to accurately restore the old name during the backward operation.
   - Modify logic to handle unnamed indexes, ensuring the original auto-generated name is used during the rollback.

Here's a descriptive outline of the modification needed (pseudo-code):



This change ensures that during the rollback, the operation correctly reverts the index to the old auto-generated name, preventing conflicts when reapplying the `RenameIndex` operation.

This should solve the issue preventing the `ProgrammingError` related to the existence of the index.

**Note**: Ensure to maintain backward compatibility and thorough testing to confirm the fix fits into the existing framework without breaking other functionalities.
