**Title**: Ensure RenameIndex Restores Old Name for Unnamed Index during Reversals

**Problem**:
The `RenameIndex` migration operation in Django is crashing when renaming an unnamed index (specifically one created for `unique_together`) backward and forward again. The issue arises because `RenameIndex` does not correctly restore the auto-generated name when moving backward, causing a "relation already exists" error.

**Analysis**:
The core of the issue lies in the `RenameIndex.database_backwards` method. This method does not handle restoring the old auto-generated name when an unnamed index is reverted. Consequently, when the operation is re-applied, it tries to create the index with an already existing name, causing a `ProgrammingError`. To solve this, we need to ensure that the old name is restored correctly when the `database_backwards` operation is executed.

**Proposed Changes**:
The necessary changes should focus on the `RenameIndex` class to ensure backward operations correctly restore the old index name for unnamed indices. The changes should be made in:

- **django/db/migrations/operations/models.py**:
  - Modify the `database_backwards` method to use the old index name if the index is unnamed when the operation moves backward.
  - Ensure the `database_forwards` method handles re-renaming the index correctly when the operation is reapplied.

**Description of Changes**:

1. **django/db/migrations/operations/models.py**:
    - Adjust the `database_backwards` method to check if the old index was unnamed and, if so, use an auto-generated name instead of the current name.
    - Refactor logic to ensure seamless backward and forward renaming of indices without crashing.

**Example Update**:
The existing `database_backwards` method could be updated to handle unnamed indices by reverting to the old auto-generated name when moving backward. This approach ensures that applying the forward operation again will not encounter naming conflicts.

By implementing these changes, the `RenameIndex` operation will be more robust, especially when dealing with unnamed indices in sequential backward and forward migrations. This will prevent the crash described and make database migrations smoother and error-free.
