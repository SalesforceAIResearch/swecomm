**Title**: Fix RenameIndex to Restore Old Auto-Generated Name When Moving Backwards

**Problem**:
The `RenameIndex` operation in Django's migrations crashes when an unnamed index is moved backward and then forward within a migration due to trying to create an index with an auto-generated name that already exists.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is that `RenameIndex` does not correctly restore the old auto-generated name of an index when it moves backwards, causing a collision when the forward operation is applied again. This results in an error where the PostgreSQL database complains that the relation already exists. Specifically, in the `database_backwards` method, when the old fields are not provided, the operation is a no-op, causing the issue on re-application.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the database state is correctly restored to its original condition when moving backwards. This involves saving and then correctly using the old auto-generated index name in the `database_backwards` method before reapplying the forward migration.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `RenameIndex` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py` to handle the restoration of the old auto-generated index name correctly when moving backward. Specifically, adjust the `database_backwards` method to correctly set the index names to avoid collisions.

* Relevant file: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`
* Relevant method: `database_backwards` inside the `RenameIndex` class.

### Steps to Fix:

1. **Check Index Type**: Update the code to check if the index is unnamed and auto-generated.
2. **Save Old Index Name**: Save the auto-generated old index name before altering it.
3. **Restore Old Index Name**: When moving backwards, restore the old index name correctly in the database to avoid duplication errors.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:

1. **Store Old Index Name**:
   - Before performing the forward migration operation, if no specific index name is provided, ensure the old auto-generated name is captured and stored.
2. **Modify `database_backwards` Method**:
   - When the `database_backwards` method is invoked, ensure that the previously captured old index name is used to rename the index back to its original name.

Here's an overview of the changes that should be made:

- Update the `RenameIndex` class:
  - Modify the `database_backwards` method to correctly handle unnamed indexes by ensuring it uses the auto-generated names and restoring them appropriately.



These changes should ensure that unnamed indexes are correctly handled and the old state is properly restored, preventing the "relation already exists" error.

By implementing these changes, the system should correctly handle renaming of indexes without causing conflicts due to existing relation names when reapplying migrations.
