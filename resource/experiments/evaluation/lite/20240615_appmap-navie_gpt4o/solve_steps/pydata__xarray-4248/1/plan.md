**Title**: Add Units Display to Dataset Repr for Coordinates and Data Variables

**Problem**:
The dataset overview (repr) does not currently display the units for coordinates and data variables. This missing feature makes it hard for users to quickly identify the units of various dataset components when viewing the dataset's summary representation.

**Analysis**:
To enhance the dataset representation, we can display units for both coordinates and data variables in the `Dataset` repr output. This will improve readability and make it easier for users to understand the context of the dataset values at a glance. The units could be part of the dataset attributes or directly associated with each variable and coordinate.

To implement this:
1. We will need to extract the `units` attribute from each coordinate and data variable.
2. Modify the `dataset_repr` function to include units in the output lines for coordinates and data variables.
3. Ensure that other related formatting utilities handle the new units feature gracefully.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `dataset_repr` function in the `xarray/core/formatting.py` file.

1. **Extract Unit Attribute**:
    - Modify the `coords_repr` and `data_vars_repr` functions to extract and display units for each coordinate and data variable, respectively.

2. **Adjust the `dataset_repr` function**:
    - Within this function, modify the logic that constructs the summary lines for coordinates and data variables to include the units if present.

3. **Helper Functions**:
    - Create helper functions, if needed, to consistently format the units for display.

### Detailed Changes:
1. **xarray/core/formatting.py**:
    - **Function: `coords_repr`**:
      - Modify to extract units from each coordinate.
      - Append the units to the coordinate summary line, formatted as shown in the example.

    - **Function: `data_vars_repr`**:
      - Modify to extract units from each data variable.
      - Append the units to the data variable summary line, formatted as shown in the example.

    - **Helper Function**:
      - Introduce a helper function `get_units` to consistently fetch the `units` attribute from the coordinates and data variables.

    - **Function: `dataset_repr`**:
      - Modify the construction of summary lines to include the formatted strings with units.

### Steps:
1. In `coords_repr` and `data_vars_repr`, add logic to fetch the `unit` attribute.
2. Insert the fetched unit into the summary lines where coordinates and data variables are being printed.
3. Make sure the string format aligns with the example given, i.e., `* x, in metres (x) float64 ...`.

By making these changes, the dataset overview will be enriched with units information, enhancing readability and usability. Once the changes are made, thorough testing should be conducted to ensure that all datasets, whether they have units or not, are displayed correctly.
