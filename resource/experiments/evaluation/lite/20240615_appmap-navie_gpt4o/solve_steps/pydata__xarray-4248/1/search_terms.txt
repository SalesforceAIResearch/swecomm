Feature request: show units in dataset overview
Here's a hypothetical dataset:

```
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  (time: 3, x: 988, y: 822)
Coordinates:
  * x         (x) float64 ...
  * y         (y) float64 ...
  * time      (time) datetime64[ns] ...
Data variables:
    rainfall  (time, y, x) float32 ...
    max_temp  (time, y, x) float32 ...
```

It would be really nice if the units of the coordinates and of the data variables were shown in the `Dataset` repr, for example as:

```
<xarray.Dataset>
Dimensions:  (time: 3, x: 988, y: 822)
Coordinates:
  * x, in metres         (x)            float64 ...
  * y, in metres         (y)            float64 ...
  * time                 (time)         datetime64[ns] ...
Data variables:
    rainfall, in mm      (time, y, x)   float32 ...
    max_temp, in deg C   (time, y, x)   float32 ...
```
