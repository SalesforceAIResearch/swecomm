**Title:** Correct and Improve Format Description for Invalid DurationField Error Message

**Problem:**

The error message for an invalid `DurationField` incorrectly states the required format of durations and possibly lacks a default `help_text`. Currently, it states: `[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]`, which does not align with the actual format accepted by Django. The correct format should be `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]`, indicating that seconds are mandatory, with optional minutes and optional hours if minutes are provided.

**Analysis:**

The root cause of this problem is an incorrect description of the expected duration format in the error message. Also, the `DurationField` class might benefit from having a default `help_text` to guide users on the correct format.

The main tasks to address the issue are:
1. Correct the error message to reflect the accurate format of durations.
2. Optionally, add a default `help_text` attribute to the `DurationField` class to improve usability.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File:** `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`
   - **Section:** Define the `DurationField` class and update its error message.
   - **Change:** Modify the `DurationField` class' error message to state the correct duration format: `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]`.
   - **Change:** Add a `help_text` attribute to the field to display the correct format to users by default.

   **Proposed Modifications:**
   1. Locate the `DurationField` class.
   2. Identify the section where the error message is defined.
   3. Change the error message to `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]`.
   4. Add an optional parameter `help_text` to the `__init__` method to set the default help text for the field.

By making these changes, the error message and the default help text will guide users more accurately on the correct format for `DurationField`. This will prevent misunderstandings and errors during data entry.
