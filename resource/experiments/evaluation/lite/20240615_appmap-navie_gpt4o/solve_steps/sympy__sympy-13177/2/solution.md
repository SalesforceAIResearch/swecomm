Let's make the specified changes to address the issue with `Mod(x**2, x)` not properly handling non-integer bases. The modification will be done in the `doit` function within the `Mod` class to ensure that both `p` and `q` are integers when making certain comparisons.

Here's the relevant portion of the file and the changes needed:

</change>

The specific change:
- Changed `p.base == q` to `p.base.is_Integer and p.base == q`.

This adjustment ensures that the comparison checking if `p.base` is equal to `q` only returns `True` if `p.base` is an integer, thus preventing erroneous results when `p` is a power expression with a non-integer base.

Make sure to test this change thoroughly to verify that it resolves the issue and does not introduce new problems. If you have any specific test cases to be added or existing ones to be run, please let me know!
