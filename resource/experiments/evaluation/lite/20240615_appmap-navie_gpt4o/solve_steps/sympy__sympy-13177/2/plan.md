**Title**: Fix Mod(x**2, x) Evaluation Logic for Non-Integer Bases

**Problem**:
The `Mod(x**2, x)` function incorrectly returns `0` for non-integer bases. Specifically, when `x` is not an integer, `x**2 % x` is not actually zero, but the current logic erroneously returns zero if the base and exponent are equal or if the base is a power with an integer exponent and its base equals the divisor.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue lies in the handling logic within the `Mod` class's evaluation function. The current implementation includes a check: 

This logic does not correctly account for cases where the base `p` is not an integer, leading to erroneous results. For example, for `Mod(x**2, x)`, where `x` is not an integer (e.g., `x = 1.5`), the result should not be zero because `1.5**2 % 1.5` equals `0.75` instead of `0`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/core/mod.py`
2. **Function**: `doit(p, q)`
3. Modify the check to properly evaluate the modulus operation by considering whether `p` and `q` are not only powers but also ensure they are integers if comparing for equality:
   - **Modification**:
     - Add a check to ensure that the base being compared in the logic is an integer.

### Detailed Modification Steps:
1. Refactor the conditional check to ensure both `p` and `p.base` are integers when comparing `p` and `q`.
2. Update the logic to avoid returning `S.Zero` erroneously for non-integer bases.

### Revised Condition:
In the `doit` function, update the specific condition as follows:
- Add a clause to check `p.is_Integer` along with the existing conditions.

**Revised Code Logic Description**:
- Ensure that the base `p` and the possible power exponent (if any) satisfy being integers before concluding that the result should be zero.

**Specific Changes**:
- Modify the relevant portion of the `doit` function in `sympy/core/mod.py` to include a check for `p` being an integer before proceeding with the return statement.

By implementing these changes, the function `Mod(x**2, x)` will correctly handle cases where `x` is not an integer and provide the accurate modulo result.
