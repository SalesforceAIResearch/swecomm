**Title**: Ensure Mod evaluates correctly for non-integer bases

**Problem**: The `Mod` function in the `doit` method incorrectly returns `0` for `Mod(x**2, x)` even when the base is not an integer. 

**Analysis**: In the current implementation of the `doit` method for the `Mod` function, there is a set of conditions that checks whether specific forms of `p` and `q` (i.e., integers or powers) should return `0`. However, these conditions do not adequately handle cases where the base `p` is not an integer. This results in incorrect evaluations such as `Mod(x**2, x)` returning `0` when `x` is a float instead of the correct modular result.

Hereâ€™s a detail of the conditions that need adjustment:
- `p == q or p == -q` correctly handles exact comparisons but does not ensure `p` and `q` are integers.
- `p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q` checks if `p` is a power and that its base and `q` are equivalent but doesn't filter by integer status.
- `p.is_integer and q == 1` is correct but remains irrelevant since `q` is 1.

The logic should be enhanced to ensure evaluations correctly handle non-integer bases. Specifically, for the case of `Mod(x**2, x)`, a check must be added to validate if `p` and `p.base` (in case of power) are integers.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sympy/core/mod.py`

2. **Function**: `doit(p, q)`

3. **Detailed changes**:

   - Modify the existing conditions to include checks ensuring both `p` and `q` (or `p.base` if `p` is a power) are integers before returning `S.Zero`.

   - Include additional conditional checks using `p.is_integer` or `q.is_integer` to make sure that the special case evaluations only apply when both `p` and `q` are integers.

4. **Steps to implement**:

   - Inside the `doit` function:
     - Update the condition:
       

       This updated condition ensures that we correctly handle cases like `Mod(x**2, x)` by only returning `S.Zero` when both parts of the modulo operation are integers.

By implementing these changes, the `Mod` function should provide correct results for cases involving non-integer bases.
