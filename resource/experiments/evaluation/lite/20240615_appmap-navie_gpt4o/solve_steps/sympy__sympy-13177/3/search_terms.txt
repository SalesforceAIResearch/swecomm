<issue>
Mod(x**2, x) is not (always) 0
When the base is not an integer, `x**2 % x` is not 0. The base is not tested to be an integer in Mod's eval logic:

```
if (p == q or p == -q or
        p.is_Pow and p.exp.is_Integer and p.base == q or
        p.is_integer and q == 1):
    return S.Zero
```

so

```
>>> Mod(x**2, x)
0
```
but
```
>>> x = S(1.5)
>>> Mod(x**2, x)
0.75
```
