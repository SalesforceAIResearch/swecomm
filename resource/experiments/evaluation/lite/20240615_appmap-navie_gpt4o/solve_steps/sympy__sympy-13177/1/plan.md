**Title: Ensure Mod(x**2, x) logic checks if the base is integer**

**Problem:**
In the current implementation, `Mod(x**2, x)` incorrectly evaluates to 0 even when `x` is not an integer. This is due to missing verification in the Mod's eval logic to check if the base `p` is an integer.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue lies in the `_mod.eval` function in the `mod.py` file. The function evaluates `Mod(x**2, x)` to 0 without ensuring `p` is an integer. The condition:



does not handle cases where `p` is not an integer correctly. When `p` is a non-integer, the behavior should be adjusted to return the correct modulo result.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File**: `sympy/core/mod.py`
   
   Modify the `doit` function to include a check to determine if `p` is an integer before applying the simplification logic that returns `S.Zero`:

   - **Modification Line**: Around line 34-53 depending on actual location of the `_mod.eval` function in the given context.
   - **Changes**:
     - Introduce a condition to check whether `p` is an integer.
     - If `p` is not an integer, fallback to the default modulo computation without applying the simplification logic.

**Detailed Changes:**

1. Enhance the condition statement inside the `_mod.eval` function:
   - Add a check within the existing if statement to ensure that `p` is an integer before returning `S.Zero`.
   - If `p` is not an integer, bypass this simplification and compute the modulo normally.

2. These adjustments can be made within the conditional block:

   **Original Code:**
    

   **Modified Code:**
    

By adding the `p.base.is_integer` check, we ensure that the condition only applies when `p.base` is an integer for the simplified results. Any non-integer `p.base` would lead to the condition not being met, and thus, it will fall through to allowing a correct modulo computation.

This proposed change ensures that `Mod(x**2, x)` accurately reflects the math and doesn't simplify to zero when `x` is a non-integer.
