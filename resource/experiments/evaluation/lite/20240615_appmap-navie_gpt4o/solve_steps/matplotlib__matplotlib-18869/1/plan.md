**Title**: Expose easily comparable version info as `version_info` in the `__init__.py`

**Problem**: 
Currently, Matplotlib only exposes the `__version__` attribute to check the version of the library. For quick and robust version checks, it would be beneficial to expose either a `version_info` tuple or a `LooseVersion` instance. This would make comparisons straightforward and more Pythonic.

**Analysis**: 
Comparing versions using `__version__` requires string manipulations that can be error-prone and inconvenient, especially when dealing with multiple levels of versions (e.g., major, minor, patch). By adding a `version_info` tuple, similar to what Python itself does, we can provide an easy and efficient way to compare versions without resorting to string operations.

Other libraries and environments (like Python's own `sys.version_info`) use tuples for version comparisons, making this approach familiar and intuitive to developers. Alternatively, `LooseVersion` from `distutils.version` offers a more flexible but less common way of handling version strings.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Modify the `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` file to include a `version_info` attribute. This should be added close to where `__version__` is defined to maintain clarity and coherence.

1. **Define `version_info`**:
   - Extract the version parts from the `__version__` string.
   - Store these parts as a tuple of integers in a new attribute called `version_info`.

2. **Ensure consistency**:
   - Make sure `version_info` is defined correctly after `__version__` is set.
   - Ensure that `version_info` is consistent with `__version__`.

3. **Backward Compatibility**:
   - Retain the existing `__version__` attribute for backward compatibility.
   - Document the new attribute in the existing docstrings to help users understand its utility.

**Changes in `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py`**:
1. Locate the definition and assignment of `__version__`.
2. Immediately after the assignment, parse the `__version__` string and create the `version_info` tuple.
3. Add the `version_info` attribute to the module's global namespace.

**Specific Change Instructions**:
1. **Locate the `__getattr__` function**:
   - Identify where `__version__` is typically set within the `__getattr__` function.

2. **Parsing and Defining**:
   - After setting `__version__`, add logic to split and convert the version string.
   - Create a `version_info` tuple from the parsed version parts.

3. **Implementation Example**:
   - Within the `_init__.py` file, modify lines around the `__version__` handling to include:
     - Parsing `__version__` (e.g., splitting by '.' and converting to integers)
     - Assigning this parsed information to `version_info`.

Here is a detailed description for making the specific change:
   
Modify `lib/matplotlib/__init__.py` around the `__version__` assignment:

1. **Locate `__getattr__` function**:
   - Within the `__getattr__` function, after setting the `__version__` attribute:

2. **Add Parsing Logic**:
   - Split the `__version__` string using `split('.')`.
   - Convert each split part to an integer (handle cases where versions might have additional qualifiers like `1.2.3rc1`).

3. **Assign to `version_info`**:
   - Define the `version_info` as a tuple of integers.

The snippet will look similar to this within the `__getattr__` function:



With these changes, users can then access `matplotlib.version_info` to perform clean and efficient version comparisons.
