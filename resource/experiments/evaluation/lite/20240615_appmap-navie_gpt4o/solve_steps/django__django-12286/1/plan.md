**Title**: Modify language consistency check to accommodate sublanguage fallback in Django settings.

**Problem**:
The Django SystemCheckError E004 incorrectly fires when LANGUAGE_CODE is set to a sublanguage that is not explicitly listed in settings.LANGUAGES, even when a corresponding base language is available.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the `check_language_settings_consistent` function strictly checks if `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` exists in `settings.LANGUAGES` without considering Django's fallback mechanism to base languages. According to Django's documentation, when a sublanguage isn't available, Django defaults to the base language if provided. Therefore, the system check should also allow for this fallback behavior instead of merely verifying the exact presence of the language code.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/core/checks/translation.py`
    - **Function**: `check_language_settings_consistent`
    - **Change**:
      1. Modify the function to extract the base language from the sublanguage if `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` is a sublanguage (e.g., 'de-at' â†’ 'de').
      2. Include an additional check to see if the base language exists in `settings.LANGUAGES`.
      3. Allow the system check to pass if either the exact sublanguage or the base language is present in `settings.LANGUAGES`.

### Detailed Description of Changes

1. Modify the `check_language_settings_consistent` function to implement the base language check.

Here's how to apply these changes in the file:

**In `django/core/checks/translation.py`**:
- Locate the existing `check_language_settings_consistent` function.
- Update the logic to first check if the exact `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` exists in `available_tags`.
- If not found, split the LANGUAGE_CODE by '-' and check if the base language is included in `available_tags`.

This modification ensures that if the system is configured with a sublanguage, the presence of a corresponding base language will allow the system check to pass, aligning with Django's translation fallback mechanism.
