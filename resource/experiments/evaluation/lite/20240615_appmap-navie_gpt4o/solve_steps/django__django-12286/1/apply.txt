To address the issue of accommodating sublanguage fallback in Django's settings, we need to make changes to the `check_language_settings_consistent` function in `django/core/checks/translation.py`. The function needs to check not only the specified `LANGUAGE_CODE` but also its base language. If either is present in `settings.LANGUAGES`, the check should pass.

Here's the proposed change:

<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">django/core/checks/translation.py</file>
<original line-count="29" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
@register(Tags.translation)
def check_language_settings_consistent(app_configs, **kwargs):
    """Error if language settings are not consistent with each other."""
    available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} | {'en-us'}
    if settings.LANGUAGE_CODE not in available_tags:
        return [E004]
    return []
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
@register(Tags.translation)
def check_language_settings_consistent(app_configs, **kwargs):
    """Error if language settings are not consistent with each other."""
    available_tags = {i for i, _ in settings.LANGUAGES} | {'en-us'}
    language_code = settings.LANGUAGE_CODE
    
    if language_code not in available_tags:
        base_language = language_code.split('-')[0]
        if base_language not in available_tags:
            return [E004]
    
    return []
]]></modified>
</change>

This modification updates the check to first ensure if the exact `LANGUAGE_CODE` exists in the available tags. If not, it then checks whether the base language (e.g., 'de' from 'de-at') is present in the available tags and only raises an error if neither is found. This change aligns with the expected behavior of Django's fallback mechanism.

By implementing these changes, you ensure that Django's language settings check accurately reflects the fallback behavior described in the documentation, reducing the chance of false positives in the system check.

Please review the changes and ensure they align with your requirements. Let me know if any further adjustments are needed.
