**Title**: Remove trailing whitespace in `DatasetGroupBy` text representation

**Problem**: 
The `DatasetGroupBy` objects in `xarray` include a trailing whitespace character in their string representation, causing issues with continuous integration checks that employ `flake8` to ensure code conformity. Specifically, this character leads to unnecessary failures in doctests and noisy git diffs, creating a conflict between the expectations of `flake8` and doctests.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue lies in the implementation of the `__repr__` method within the `DatasetGroupBy` class. During the construction of the string representation, an extraneous space character is appended before the newline character. Correcting this behavior requires adjusting the string formatting to exclude the trailing whitespace. 

We need to ensure that only a single character, which is the newline character (`\n`), separates lines in the string representation. By modifying the `__repr__` method, the trailing whitespace can be removed without altering the intended structure and readability of the output.

**Proposed Changes**:
To resolve this issue with minimal disruption, the following changes should be made in `xarray/core/groupby.py`:

1. **Function**: `DatasetGroupBy.__repr__`
   - **Current Logic**: The format string in the `__repr__` method includes an extra space before the newline character.
   - **Modification**: Adjust the format string to eliminate the trailing space character, ensuring that only the newline character follows the group label.

Here are the specific changes required:

- Modify the `__repr__` method of the `DatasetGroupBy` class in the `xarray/core/groupby.py` file.
- Update the format string to remove the trailing whitespace before the newline character.

**Location for Changes**:
- **File**: `xarray/core/groupby.py`

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. Locate the `__repr__` method within the `DatasetGroupBy` class.
2. Modify the string format to ensure no trailing whitespace before the newline character.



By implementing these changes, the trailing whitespace issue in the `DatasetGroupBy` string representation will be resolved, aligning the output with the requirements of both `flake8` and doctests. This enhancement will help maintain a clean codebase and reduce friction in continuous integration processes.
