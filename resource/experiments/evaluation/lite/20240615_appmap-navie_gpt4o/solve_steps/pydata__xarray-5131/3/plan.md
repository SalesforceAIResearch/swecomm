**Title**: Remove trailing whitespace in DatasetGroupBy text representation

**Problem**: 
The `DatasetGroupBy` string representation in xarray contains a trailing whitespace in the first line of its output, which causes issues with flake8 checks and doctests. As an example:



The trailing whitespace after 'letters' in the first line leads to flake8 violations and doctest failures due to mismatch in expected output.

**Analysis**:
The root cause is the inclusion of a trailing whitespace in the string formed for the `DatasetGroupBy` representation. Since the trailing whitespace has no apparent functional impact, it is safe to remove it to resolve the conflicts with formatting tools and ensure consistency in the output.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: Modify `xarray/core/groupby.py` 
    - **Function/Method**: Locate the `__repr__` method or the equivalent method used to generate the string representation of `DatasetGroupBy`.
    - **Modification**: Remove any trailing whitespace appended to the string being constructed.

**Detailed Change**:
1. **Modification in `xarray/core/groupby.py`**:
    - Locate the `__repr__` method or similar method responsible for string representation.
    - Ensure no trailing whitespace is added at the end of the string. Specifically, check the use of string concatenation or formatting to avoid the extra space after 'letters'.

This change ensures that the representation of `DatasetGroupBy` objects does not include trailing whitespace, resolving the issues with flake8 and doctests without impacting the core functionality.
