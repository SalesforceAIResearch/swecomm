**Title**: Remove trailing whitespace from DatasetGroupBy text representation

**Problem**: 
When displaying a `DatasetGroupBy` object in an interactive Python session, the first line of the output contains a trailing whitespace. This trailing whitespace causes issues with documentation tests (doctests) and code formatting checks (flake8) used in continuous integration. Removing it would prevent these conflicts and align the actual output with expected formatting standards.

**Analysis**:
The issue lies in the representation method of the `DatasetGroupBy` class. The presence of the trailing whitespace in the output string is unnecessary and detrimental as it leads to failures in doctests and flake8 checks. This trailing whitespace can be trimmed easily without altering the meaningful content of the output.

The `__repr__` method of the `DatasetGroupBy` class is likely responsible for generating the output. The solution involves ensuring that the last character of the first line in the output string is not a space before concatenating it with subsequent lines.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `__repr__` method in the `DatasetGroupBy` class to remove trailing whitespace from the first line of its output.

To implement the fix, follow these steps:

1. **File**: `xarray/core/groupby.py` (Assumed file - you might need to locate this exact file if the structure is different)
2. **Function**: `DatasetGroupBy.__repr__` or equivalent.

**Step-by-Step Changes**:
1. Navigate to the `xarray/core/groupby.py` file, where the `DatasetGroupBy` class is located.
2. Locate the `__repr__` method in the `DatasetGroupBy` class.
3. Identify the string that forms the first line of the representation.
4. Use string manipulation to remove any trailing whitespace from this line before returning the final formatted string.

Example of changes to be made:
- Trim the trailing whitespace by using the `rstrip()` method on the first part of the representation string before it's combined with other parts of the string.

These adjustments will ensure that the first line of the dataset's textual representation no longer has a trailing whitespace, resolving the issues with doctests and flake8 checks without ignoring important formatting checks.

After making this change, verify that the doctests pass and that flake8 no longer raises errors related to trailing whitespace in the `DatasetGroupBy` string representation.
