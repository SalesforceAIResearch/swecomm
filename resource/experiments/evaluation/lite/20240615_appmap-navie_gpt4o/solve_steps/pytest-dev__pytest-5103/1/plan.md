**Title**: Enhance AssertionError Reports by Unrolling Iterables in `all`/`any` Calls

**Problem**: 
The current implementation of the `assert` statement with `all` and `any` calls does not provide useful failure messages for debugging. When using `all` or `any` with iterable comprehensions, the error messages are non-informative as they donâ€™t indicate which specific elements caused the failure. This is in contrast to the more verbose but clearer for-loop approach, which pinpoints the exact failing element.

**Analysis**: 
The issue arises because the `assert` statement with `all` or `any` does not capture the state of each element in the iterable being evaluated. Instead, it only returns `False`, which doesn't help in understanding what element(s) caused the failure. To provide better error messages, the assertion logic should be enhanced to unroll the iterable and evaluate each element individually. This approach would allow the assertion to benefit from more granular error reporting akin to the reports from a for-loop.

**Proposed Changes**: 

1. **Modify `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` to handle `all`/`any` assertions**: 
    - Update the assertion rewrite logic to identify when `all` or `any` is used within an `assert` statement.
    - Implement logic to transform these assertions into an equivalent for-loop construct that can provide detailed failure reports.

### Step-by-Step Changes:

1. **Identify `all`/`any` assertions in `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`**:
    - Locate the part of the code where assertion statements are parsed and processed.
    - Add detection for `all` and `any` calls within `assert` statements.

2. **Unroll the iterable and generate new assertion code**:
    - When an `all` or `any` call is detected, write logic to unroll the iterable.
    - Transform the `all` or `any` assertion into a for-loop construct to check each element individually and assert the predicate.

3. **Generate detailed error messages**:
    - Modify the rewritten code to provide detailed assertion failure messages that include the specific element(s) causing the failure.

### Example Transformation:
Transform the following:

Into:

Or equivalently into:


By making these changes, the error message will indicate which specific element in the iterable caused the failure, greatly improving the debugging experience.

**Key Files to Modify**:
- `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`: Contains the logic for rewriting assert statements. This is the primary file where changes should be applied to detect and transform `all`/`any` assertions.

By implementing these changes, we can significantly enhance the error reporting for assertions involving `all` and `any`, making it easier for developers to diagnose and fix issues in their tests.
