**Title**: Modify `partitions()` to yield copies of dictionaries to avoid reuse issues

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `partitions()` iterator in `sympy.utilities.iterables` reuses the dictionaries it outputs. This behavior can lead to confusion and subtle bugs, as operations like `list(partitions())` can produce incorrect results or unexpected side-effects when the partition dictionaries are modified further.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue lies in the reuse of the dictionary objects in the `partitions()` iterator. When these dictionaries are yielded and subsequently modified, the modifications affect all references to the dictionary due to its mutable nature. This can lead to incorrect or unexpected behavior in various scenarios where the partitions are used or manipulated after being generated.

To resolve this, the `partitions()` function should yield copies of the dictionaries instead of the original dictionaries. This ensures that each yielded partition is independent and cannot be inadvertently modified by operations on other partitions.

**Proposed Changes**:
The necessary modification should be made to the `partitions()` function in the `sympy/utilities/iterables.py` file. Specifically, when yielding a partition, a copy of the dictionary should be created and yielded instead of the original dictionary.

1. Locate the `partitions()` function in `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`.
2. Modify the logic to create a copy of the dictionary before it is yielded. This can be done using the `dict.copy()` method or the `copy` module for a deep copy if nested dictionaries are involved.

### Detailed Change Description:
- In `sympy/utilities/iterables.py`:
  - Find the point in the `partitions()` function where the dictionary representing a partition is yielded.
  - Before yielding, create a copy of the dictionary using `dict.copy()`.

This change ensures that each partition yielded by the `partitions()` iterator is a fresh, independent dictionary, thus preventing downstream modifications from causing unexpected issues.

By implementing these changes, we enhance the robustness of the `partitions()` iterator, making it safer and more intuitive to use, and eliminating potential sources of subtle bugs caused by dictionary reuse.
