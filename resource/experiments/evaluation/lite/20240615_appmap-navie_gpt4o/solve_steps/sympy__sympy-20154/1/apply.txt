def partitions(n, m=None, k=None, size=False):
    """Generate all partitions of positive integer, n.

    Parameters
    ==========

    m : integer (default gives partitions of all sizes)
        limits number of parts in partition (mnemonic: m, maximum parts)
    k : integer (default gives partitions number from 1 through n)
        limits the numbers that are kept in the partition (mnemonic: k, keys)
    size : bool (default False, only partition is returned)
        when ``True`` then (M, P) is returned where M is the sum of the
        multiplicities and P is the generated partition.

    Each partition is represented as a dictionary, mapping an integer
    to the number of copies of that integer in the partition.  For example,
    the first partition of 4 returned is {4: 1}, "4: one of them".

    Note that the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time.
    This is for speed:  generating each partition goes quickly,
    taking constant time, independent of n.

    >>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]
    [{1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}, {1: 6}]

    If you want to build a list of the returned dictionaries then
    make a copy of them:

    >>> [p.copy() for p in partitions(6, k=2)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [{2: 3}, {1: 2, 2: 2}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 6}]
    >>> [(M, p.copy()) for M, p in partitions(6, k=2, size=True)]  # doctest: +SKIP
    [(3, {2: 3}), (4, {1: 2, 2: 2}), (5, {1: 4, 2: 1}), (6, {1: 6})]

    Each dictionary object returned is a copy. This is to ensure that each partition
    is independent of others, avoiding reuse issues. Generating each partition
    still goes quickly, taking constant time, independent of n.

    >>> [p for p in partitions(6, k=2)]
    [{2: 3}, {1: 2, 2: 2}, {1: 4, 2: 1}, {1: 6}]
    >>> [(M, p) for M, p in partitions(6, k=2, size=True)]
    [(3, {2: 3}), (4, {1: 2, 2: 2}), (5, {1: 4, 2: 1}), (6, {1: 6})]
