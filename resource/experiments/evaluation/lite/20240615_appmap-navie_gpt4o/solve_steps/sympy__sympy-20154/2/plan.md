**Title**: Modify `partitions()` to return copies of the output dictionaries

**Problem**: 
The `partitions()` iterator in `sympy.utilities.iterables` reuses the output dictionaries, which can lead to unexpected behavior and subtle bugs. This is especially problematic when the iterator's output is collected into a list or used in complex ways, as each dictionary reference points to the same underlying object.

**Analysis**:
The root of the issue lies in how the `partitions()` iterator generates and yields partitions. By reusing the dictionary objects, any subsequent changes to one dictionary will affect all previously yielded dictionaries that refer to the same object. Making a shallow copy of each dictionary before yielding it solves this problem as it provides a fresh, independent dictionary for each yield.

The change involves modifying the logic where dictionaries are yielded, ensuring that a copy of the dictionary is created. The proposed fix does introduce a slight performance overhead due to the copy operation, but it will lead to more intuitive and error-free behavior.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **sympy/utilities/iterables.py**:
   - Locate the definition of the `partitions()` function in the file.
   - Update the code to make a shallow copy of the dictionary before it is yielded.
   - Ensure that the docstring is modified to remove the caveat about dictionary reuse.

**Detailed Changes**:
1. **sympy/utilities/iterables.py**
   - Locate the function `partitions()`.
   - Modify the `yield` statement in the function to yield a copy of the dictionary instead of the original.

     For instance:
     
   - Update the docstring of `partitions()` to reflect the new behavior. Remove any instructions or caveats about dictionary reuse.

By making these changes, the `partitions()` function will now return a new dictionary for each partition, making its usage more predictable and safer in various contexts.
