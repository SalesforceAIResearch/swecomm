**Title**: Fix Python 2 to 3 Pickle Compatibility for Float-containing Expressions

**Problem**:
Transferring a pickled Sympy expression containing a float from Python 2 to Python 3 results in an error. This issue is caused by differences in the way Python 2 and Python 3 handle numerics, particularly the representation of integers with a suffix ('L') in Python 2 that is not recognized in Python 3.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem lies in the way numeric literals, particularly long integers (with the 'L' suffix), are serialized and deserialized between Python versions. In Python 2, long integers are represented with an 'L' suffix, while Python 3 does not use this suffix. When the pickled data is read in Python 3, it encounters an unexpected 'L' character, causing a `ValueError`.

To address this, the logic where numeric strings are parsed needs to be updated to handle or strip the 'L' suffix if it exists, ensuring compatibility with Python 3. Specifically, the error trace shows that the issue originates from the file `sympy/core/numbers.py` in the `__new__` method of a likely `Number` class.

**Proposed Changes**:
The changes should be made in `sympy/core/numbers.py`.

1. **sympy/core/numbers.py**:
   - Locate the `__new__` method handling the numeric creation and parsing logic.
   - Update the parsing logic to handle the 'L' suffix appropriately.
   - If a string representing a number ends with 'L', remove the suffix before attempting to convert the string to an integer.

Detailed description of changes:
- Modify the `__new__` method to inspect the string representation of the number.
- If the number contains a long integer designation ('L'), strip the suffix.
- Convert the cleaned string to an integer or float as appropriate.

This will ensure that the deserialization of pickles containing numeric types created in Python 2 works correctly in Python 3.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File: sympy/core/numbers.py**
   - Locate the `__new__` method (within a class that handles numeric types).
   - Update the conversion logic to handle and strip the 'L' suffix from numeric strings.
   - Add a condition to check for the 'L' suffix in the string representation of the number, and remove it before conversion.

By ensuring the numeric parsing logic is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3, the pickled data containing floats will be correctly deserialized in Python 3, thereby solving the reported issue.
