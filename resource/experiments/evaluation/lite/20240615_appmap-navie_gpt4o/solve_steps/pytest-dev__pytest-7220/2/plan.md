**Title**: Adjust path to test file in error messages when directory changed in fixture

**Problem**: When the working directory is changed in a fixture, pytest displays the test file path as relative to the new directory. This makes it difficult for editors to jump to the error location since they are unaware of the directory change.

**Analysis**: The root cause of this issue lies in how pytest handles the display of file paths in error messages. Specifically, when the working directory is changed during the execution of a test (e.g., via a fixture), the paths displayed in error messages become relative to the new directory. The expected behavior is for these paths to remain relative to the original directory where pytest was invoked.

To fix this, the path calculation logic within pytest needs to be adjusted. The path should be preserved relative to the root directory where pytest was initially invoked, regardless of any subsequent directory changes during test execution.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `src/_pytest/config/__init__.py`
    - **Function**: `invocation_dir`
    - **Logic**: Ensure that the `invocation_dir` remains constant and correct even when the directory is changed mid-test. This function should return the directory from which `pytest` was invoked.

2. **File**: `src/_pytest/terminal.py`
    - **Function**: `_locationline` 
    - **Logic**: Modify how file paths are resolved in error messages. Ensure that the paths displayed remain relative to the original invocation directory by referencing `config.invocation_dir`.

3. **File**: `src/_pytest/nodes.py`
    - **Function**: `_repr_failure_py`
    - **Logic**: Adjust how the path for the failure representation is computed to ensure it remains accurate relative to the original invocation directory.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:

1. **src/_pytest/config/__init__.py**
    - Ensure that the `invocation_dir` property remains constant and points to the directory where pytest was initially invoked.

2. **src/_pytest/terminal.py**
    - Modify the `_locationline` function to resolve file paths relative to the `invocation_dir` stored in the config. This change keeps the error message paths consistent with the initial directory structure.

3. **src/_pytest/nodes.py**
    - Adjust the `_repr_failure_py` function to use the `invocation_dir` for computing failure paths. This ensures that even with directory changes during execution, failure paths remain accurate.

With these changes, when a directory is changed in a fixture during test execution, the paths displayed in error messages will remain relative to the original directory where pytest was invoked. This ensures consistency and correctness, making it easier for developers to locate and address test failures.

Making these changes will provide a more intuitive and less error-prone experience, allowing paths in test outputs to be correctly interpreted regardless of any working directory changes during test execution.
