**Title**: Preserve original file path when directory is changed by a fixture

**Problem**: 
When a test changes the working directory using a fixture, the displayed file paths in error messages become relative to the new directory. This confuses the user and makes it hard to navigate to the error location, as IDEs/editors are unaware of the directory change.

**Analysis**:
The core issue arises because the `cwd` (current working directory) is being changed during the test, which affects how file paths are displayed in error traces. The file path should remain relative to the original directory to ensure consistent navigation.

To address this, modifications are required in the reporting mechanism to ensure it preserves the original path and is not affected by changes in the working directory during the execution of tests.

Given the provided code snippets, the best place to handle this issue is within the `_pytest.reports.py` module, as it manages the error reporting logic.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Modify `BaseReport` class in `src/_pytest/reports.py`**:
   - Ensure the error path reported remains relative to the original root directory. We can achieve this by capturing the `original_cwd` at the start and ensuring all paths used in error reporting are made relative to this `original_cwd`.

**Detailed Proposed Changes**:

1. **Capture Original Working Directory**:
   - Add a method to capture the original working directory (`original_cwd`) when the configuration is initialized.

2. **Adjust Report Generation**:
   - Modify the logic used to generate the paths within error reports to ensure they are displayed relative to the original directory.

In `src/_pytest/reports.py`:

1. Capture `original_cwd`:
   - In the `pytest_configure` hook (in `conftest.py` if it exists or create a hook handler in `_pytest/config.py`), capture the original current working directory (cwd) and store it in the `config` object.

2. Adjust Path Reporting in `BaseReport` and other relevant classes:
   - Adjust the `to_terminal` method within `BaseReport` and possibly other relevant methods to ensure paths are adjusted relative to the `original_cwd`.

In `src/_pytest/config.py` or `conftest.py` (whichever exists or you choose to use):
- Capture `original_cwd`:
    

In `src/_pytest/reports.py`:

- Adjust path reporting:
    

This will ensure that even if the working directory changes during the test execution, the error paths reported will remain relative to the original directory, making it consistent for the users and their editors/IDEs.
