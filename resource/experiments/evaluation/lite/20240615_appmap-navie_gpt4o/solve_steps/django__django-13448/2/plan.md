**Title:** Fix the issue with "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False} causing test runner crash

**Problem:**
When using the Django 3.1 `TEST: {"MIGRATE": False}` database setting during test runs, the test runner crashes because the `django_admin_log` relation does not exist. This prevents the tests from being executed properly.

**Analysis:**
The provided tracebacks indicate that the problem originates from the lack of migration application when using `TEST: {"MIGRATE": False}` setting. During the test database setup, the tables are not created, resulting in `django_admin_log` and potentially other tables not being present. The issue surfaces when attempting to serialize the database to a string.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that even when migrations are skipped (`MIGRATE=False`), the essential tables are still created. This can be accomplished by ensuring that the command `migrate` or `syncdb` is conditionally called based on the `MIGRATE` setting.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. Modify the `create_test_db` method within `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` to handle the `MIGRATE` setting appropriately by ensuring essential tables are created.
2. Ensure the `_execute_create_test_db` method properly handles any existing tables if `MIGRATE=False`.

Detailed file changes:
1. **File:** `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`
    - **Function:** `create_test_db`
      - Add a check for `settings.DATABASES[self.connection.alias]['TEST'].get('MIGRATE', True)`:
        - If `MIGRATE` is `False`, ensure essential tables are created by calling `syncdb` instead of `migrate`.
      - After verifying the state, proceed with the existing database creation and serialization logic.

2. **File:** `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`
    - **Function:** `_execute_create_test_db`
      - Handle the situation where `keepdb` is `True` to ensure the existing database state is appropriately managed without causing crashes.

By implementing these changes, we should ensure that the test runner does not crash when `TEST: {"MIGRATE": False}` setting is used. This will allow users to skip migrations but still have essential tables in place and proceed with database testing as expected.
