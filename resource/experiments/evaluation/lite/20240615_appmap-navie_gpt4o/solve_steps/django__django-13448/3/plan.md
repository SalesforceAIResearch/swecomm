**Title**: Fix setup_databases crash with "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False} in Django 3.1

**Problem**: 
When trying to use the new `"MIGRATE": False` setting in the `TEST` configuration of Django 3.1's database settings, running tests results in a crash. The traceback indicates that database tables are unavailable, leading to `psycopg2.errors.UndefinedTable` and `django.db.utils.ProgrammingError`. This issue does not occur when the `"MIGRATE": False` setting is removed, implying a problem specific to the new feature.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue is that the new `"MIGRATE": False` setting prevents the database from being migrated, thus the necessary tables are not created, resulting in the errors when the code attempts to access them. The `serialize_db_to_string` method tries to serialize all data in the database, which fails because the required tables do not exist.

To address this problem, the `serialize_db_to_string` method should be modified to handle the case where migrations are disabled. Specifically, it should check the `TEST` settings for `"MIGRATE": False` and conditionally skip the serialization process if migrations are not being run.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`

   **Function**: `serialize_db_to_string`:
   - Add a check for the `"MIGRATE": False` setting before attempting to serialize the database.
   - If the setting is present and set to `False`, skip the serialization process and log a relevant message.

   Detailed changes:
   - Inside the `serialize_db_to_string` function, add a check to see if `self.connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('MIGRATE', True)` is `False`.
   - If `MIGRATE` is `False`, log a message indicating that serialization is being skipped due to the `MIGRATE` setting, and return an empty string or a pre-defined stub indicating no serialization is performed.

This change ensures that the `serialize_db_to_string` method does not attempt to serialize database tables that do not exist when migrations are skipped, preventing the observed crash.

Here is a detailed description of the modification needed:

   1.1 **File**: `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`
   
   **Location**: Within the `serialize_db_to_string` function (approximately line 94 onwards).

   **Changes**:
   - Modify the function to check for the `MIGRATE` setting in `self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']`.
   - Return early with an appropriate message or stub if `MIGRATE` is set to `False`.

By implementing these changes, the `setup_databases` function will handle the case where migrations are skipped, enabling the tests to run successfully without crashing due to missing database tables.

This solution maintains the overall functionality and purpose of the `serialize_db_to_string` method, while adding the necessary checks for the `MIGRATE` setting to ensure compatibility with the new feature in Django 3.1.
