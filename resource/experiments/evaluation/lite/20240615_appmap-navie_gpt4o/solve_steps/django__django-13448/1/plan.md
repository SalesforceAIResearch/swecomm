**Title**: Fix crash in `setup_databases` when using "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False} in Django 3.1

**Problem**: When running tests with the database setting "TEST": {"MIGRATE": False}, the test runner crashes with an error indicating that the "django_admin_log" relation does not exist. This prevents the use of the new feature to skip migrations during testing.

**Analysis**: 
The error occurs due to the attempt to serialize the current state of the database to a string through the method `serialize_db_to_string()`. The crash indicates that the necessary tables (e.g., "django_admin_log") are not present in the database when tests are initiated with migrations disabled. This is because the `serialize_db_to_string` method tries to serialize data from models that assume the database schema is already set up, which isnâ€™t true when migrations are skipped.

Here's a breakdown of probable causes and necessary logic changes:

1. **Cause**: 
   - The method `serialize_db_to_string()` attempts to access tables that do not exist because migrations are disabled (`"MIGRATE": False`).
   - The `create_test_db` method serializes the database state unconditionally, even if migrations are skipped.

2. **Resolution**:
   - Modify the `create_test_db` to add a condition not to serialize the database state if migrations are disabled.
   - Optionally, add logging to inform the user that serialization is skipped because migrations are disabled.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Modify the following function in the `django/db/backends/base/creation.py` file to check the migration setting before serialization:

1. **File**: `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`
   - Locate the function `create_test_db`.
   - Add a conditional check to ensure serialization is only attempted if migrations are enabled.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Function: `create_test_db`**
   - After obtaining the test database name and before serialization occurs, add a condition to check the `MIGRATE` setting.
   - If `MIGRATE` is set to `False`, skip the serialization step.

Adjust the function `create_test_db` as follows:

   - Add a check for `self.connection.settings_dict['TEST'].get('MIGRATE', True)`:
     - If `MIGRATE` is `False`, skip the step `self.connection._test_serialized_contents = self.serialize_db_to_string()`.

2. **Function: `serialize_db_to_string`** (if necessary):
   - Check if this function is called anywhere else directly where a similar `MIGRATE` condition might be needed.

Example of modification in comments for the `create_test_db` function:
- Before modification:
    
- After modification:
    

By adding this condition, the crash should be avoided when `MIGRATE` is set to `False`, allowing tests to run without requiring the database schema to be fully migrated.
