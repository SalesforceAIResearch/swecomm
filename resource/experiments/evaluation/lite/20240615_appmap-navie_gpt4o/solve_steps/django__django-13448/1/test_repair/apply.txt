To address the issue where the test suite is failing due to the `app_unmigrated` module being missing, we need to ensure that the test configuration and setup are correctly handling modules and apps that may be dynamically added or removed during testing. From the provided information, it seems there might be a misconfiguration in the test setup or a missing module that should be installed or registered.

Given the provided snippets, I'll make necessary changes to ensure that the test suite can handle such scenarios or improve diagnostics to provide better feedback in such cases.

### Change 1: Improving Diagnostic Output

I will enhance the test runner to provide detailed output when a module fails to load, which will help in diagnosing why the `app_unmigrated` module is not found.

```xml

```

### Change 2: Adding Detailed Error Logging

I'll modify the `loadTestsFromName` method in the test runner to log detailed information about import failures.

```xml

```

### Change 3: Initializing the Logger

I'll ensure the logger is initialized correctly at the start of the test run.

```xml

```

These changes will enhance the diagnostics by logging detailed errors about why a particular module like `app_unmigrated` was not found. This will aid in determining if there's a missing setup step, an overlooked dependency, or an environmental issue causing the failure.

Please review the above changes and let me know if further modifications or additional functionality is needed.
