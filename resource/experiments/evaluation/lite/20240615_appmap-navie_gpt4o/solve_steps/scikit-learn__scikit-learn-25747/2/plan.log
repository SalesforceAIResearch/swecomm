**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

FeatureUnion not working when aggregating data and pandas transform output selected
### Describe the bug

I would like to use `pandas` transform output and use a custom transformer in a feature union which aggregates data. When I'm using this combination I got an error. When I use default `numpy` output it works fine.

### Steps/Code to Reproduce

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin
from sklearn import set_config
from sklearn.pipeline import make_union

index = pd.date_range(start="2020-01-01", end="2020-01-05", inclusive="left", freq="H")
data = pd.DataFrame(index=index, data=[10] * len(index), columns=["value"])
data["date"] = index.date

    def fit(self, X: pd... (6056)
