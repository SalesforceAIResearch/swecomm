according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name with libraries in TEMPLATES
Description
	
I didn't explore this thoroughly, but I think there might be an issue with the check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name when you add a template tag library into TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['librairies'].
I'm getting an error like: 
(templates.E003) 'my_tags' is used for multiple template tag modules: 'someapp.templatetags.my_tags', 'someapp.templatetags.my_tags'
