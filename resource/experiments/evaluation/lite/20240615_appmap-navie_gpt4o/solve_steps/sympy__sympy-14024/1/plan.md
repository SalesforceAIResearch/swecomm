**Title**: Correct Simplification Inconsistency for \( (-a)^x \cdot a^{-x} \) when \( a \) is a Positive Integer

**Problem**: The `simplify` function in SymPy produces inconsistent results for \( (-a)^x \cdot a^{-x} \) when \( a \) is a positive integer. Specifically, while the simplification works correctly symbolically, inconsistencies arise during numerical evaluations. This inconsistency is due to the incorrect handling of the simplification when `a` is a positive integer.

**Analysis**: The root cause of this problem lies in the `simplify` method where it simplifies \( (-a)^x \cdot a^{-x} \) directly to \( (-1)^x \). This transformation assumes real-number properties that do not hold uniformly across all cases, especially with complex numbers. Specifically, when substituting for negative fractional exponents, the results diverge due to the incorrect assumptions about the base `a`.

To address this inconsistency, we need to ensure that the simplification accounts for the correct behavior of complex powers. This means making sure that the simplification honors the branch cuts of logarithms used in exponentiation, particularly for cases where the base and exponent might result in complex values.

**Proposed Changes**: Modify the appropriate function in the most relevant file, `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`, to correctly handle the simplification of \( (-a)^x \cdot a^{-x} \).

1. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py**:
    - Locate the `simplify` method responsible for simplifying exponentiated expressions.
    - Add checks to handle cases when `(-a)^x * a^(-x)` specifically.
    - Ensure the modifications respect complex number properties and branch cuts. The detailed changes might include:
        - Identifying when `a` is a positive integer.
        - Adding conditional logic to verify the power transformation adheres to mathematical consistency, potentially involving complex logarithms.

The primary goal is to adjust the simplification mechanism to ensure that it does not naively simplify \( (-a)^x \cdot a^{-x} \) to \( (-1)^x \) without considering the complex implications in specific cases such as negative or fractional exponents.

**Conclusion**: By refining the `simplify` implementation with the above changes, we can ensure mathematically consistent simplifications across symbolic and numeric evaluations, thus preventing the identified inconsistencies.
