**Title**: Update `django.utils.text.slugify()` to Strip Leading and Trailing Dashes and Underscores

**Problem**: The `slugify` function in `django.utils.text` currently does not remove leading and trailing dashes and underscores, resulting in unwanted characters in the output. For example, `text.slugify("___This is a test ---")` currently produces `___this-is-a-test-` instead of the expected `this-is-a-test`.

**Analysis**: 
The `slugify` function is designed to convert input text to a slug format, which is typically used in URLs. The current implementation strips whitespace and special characters but does not handle leading or trailing dashes and underscores properly. Modifying the function to clean these characters will improve its utility and ensure the generated slugs are cleaner.

Here's the step-by-step logic for the changes:

1. Normalize the Unicode string to NFKD if `allow_unicode` is not set.
2. Remove non-alphanumeric characters except for hyphens and underscores.
3. Convert to lowercase.
4. Replace spaces and other specified characters with hyphens.
5. Trim leading and trailing hyphens and underscores.

**Proposed Changes**: 

File: `django/utils/text.py`

1. **Update the logic within the `slugify` function**:
    - At the end of the existing `slugify` function, add logic to strip the leading and trailing dashes and underscores from the resultant slug.

2. **Details of modifications**:
    - In the `django/utils/text.py` file, within the `slugify` function, after replacing characters with hyphens, strip the hyphens and underscores from both ends of the string:
      - `value = value.strip('-_')`

**Suggested modifications in `django/utils/text.py`**:

1. Locate the `slugify` function in the `django/utils/text.py` file.

2. Append the following line at the end of the function, just before the return statement in the function:

    - `value = value.strip('-_')`

These changes will ensure that leading and trailing dashes and underscores are removed, resulting in cleaner slugs.

Example After Changes:



Implementing these changes will ensure that the `slugify` function produces the expected output: `this-is-a-test` when given the input `___This is a test ---`.

Note: Make sure to test the updated functionality thoroughly with various edge cases to ensure the robustness of the `slugify` function.
