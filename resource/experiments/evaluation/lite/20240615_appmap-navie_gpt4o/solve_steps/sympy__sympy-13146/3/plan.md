**Title**: Modify Simplification Logic to Handle Fractional Exponents

**Problem**: 
SymPy does not fully simplify expressions involving fractional exponents. Given an expression like `S(1)/2*x**2.5 - S(1)*x**(S(5)/2)/2`, the simplification result is `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` instead of `0`.

**Analysis**: 
The issue here stems from the `simplify` function not recognizing that `-0.5*x**2.5 + 0.5*x**2.5` should be simplified to `0`. This happens because fractional exponents are not being handled correctly during the simplification process, potentially due to a mismatch in the canonical forms of the two terms.

To solve this issue, the simplification algorithm needs to be enhanced to correctly identify and combine terms with fractional exponents.

**Proposed Changes**:
The file most relevant for the changes is `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py`. This is where simplification of terms involving exponents, including fractional ones, can be modified.

1. **File: `sympy/simplify/sqrtdenest.py`**

   - Locate and modify the section where fractional exponents are processed within the simplification routine.
   - Enhance the `_sqrt_symbolic_denest` function to accommodate and correctly simplify terms with equivalent fractional exponents.

2. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Go to the `_sqrt_symbolic_denest` function. This function aims to help simplify expressions involving square roots symbolically.
   - **Step 2**: Review the logic that determines if expressions can be denested. Modify this logic to more robustly handle fractional exponents by ensuring terms are consistently represented for comparison.
   - **Step 3**: Ensure that terms with equivalent fractional exponents, but represented differently (like `x**2.5` and `x**(S(5)/2)`), are detected and combined.

**Conclusion**: This modification will allow the simplification routine to detect and combine terms with the same fractional exponents, even when they are represented differently, resolving the issue of failing to simplify them to zero.
