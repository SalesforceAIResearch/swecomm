### Enhance the Simplification of Exponent Expressions

**Problem:**

Expressions with exponents do not fully simplify. For instance, two equivalent expressions, such as `1/2*x**2.5` and `x**(5/2)/2`, do not simplify to zero upon subtraction.

**Analysis:**

The core issue stems from the way SymPy internally handles exponentiation and fractional values in expressions. Typically, SymPy's `simplify` method should be able to handle these cases, but it seems to falter when dealing with fractional exponents in combination with floating-point representation.

To address this, we need to ensure that fractional exponents are consistently recognized and simplified. The `simplify` method in SymPy calls several internal transformation rules and simplification techniques. Therefore, the right course of action would involve enhancing these internal simplification routines to handle such cases more effectively.

**Proposed Changes:**

To resolve this problem, we specifically need to make changes in areas of the code that deal with simplification rules or exponentiation simplifications.

The `sympy/series/formal.py` file appears to host some of the relevant code dealing with the series and transformations which may need enhancements. Based on the selected code snippets, especially sections where exponential transformations and simplifications are performed, focus on the `_transformation_*` and any part of the simplification routines.

1. #### File: sympy/series/formal.py
    - **Function to Update:** Consider enhancing `_transformation_*` routines or simplify method internals.
    - **Changes to be Made:**
        - Ensure proper handling of fractional exponents.
        - Improve checks for equivalence in terms involving exponentiation.
        - Apply additional transformations that focus on fractional exponents and their normalization.

Hereâ€™s a high-level description of what needs to be done:

1. **Ensure Consistent Recognition of Exponential Representation:**
    - Modify the transformation functions to handle fractional exponents more robustly.
    - Ensure expressions are normalized before performing equivalence checks.

2. **Enhanced Simplification Rules:**
    - Introduce or enhance existing rules in the simplification routine to reformat expressions with fractional exponents into a canonical form.
    - Ensure that subtraction of equivalent terms results in zero by refining the floating-point precision handling and representation of exponents.

In detail:

1. **Fractional Exponent Handling:**
    - Update functions like `_transformation_a`, `_transformation_b`, etc., to account for fractional exponents by ensuring their canonical form.

2. **Normalization Pre-checks:**
    - Implement pre-simplification normalization in functions that handle equation transformations or simplifications.

By following these proposed steps, SymPy should be able to simplify expressions involving fractional exponents more accurately, ultimately resolving issues where equivalent expressions do not cancel out as expected.
