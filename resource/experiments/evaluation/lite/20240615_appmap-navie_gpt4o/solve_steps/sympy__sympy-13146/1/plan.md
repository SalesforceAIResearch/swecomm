**Title**: Fix Exponent Simplification in SymPy

**Problem**: 
When subtracting two expressions with the same base and exponent but different string representations, the simplification does not result in zero as expected. Instead, it retains the terms with slight differences, leading to non-zero outputs even when the expressions are effectively the same.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this problem lies in the internal handling of symbolic expressions with rational exponents. When expressions are constructed with different types (e.g., floating point vs. rational numbers), the simplification functions may not recognize them as equivalent. This inconsistency can lead to the retention of terms that should cancel each other out during the simplification process.

To resolve this issue, the code must ensure that exponents are consistently treated in a canonical form, allowing the simplification algorithms to correctly identify and cancel out equivalent terms.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `eval` method in the `Pow` class (`sympy/core/power.py`), which is responsible for handling power expressions. Ensure that the method converts exponents to a canonical form (preferably rational) before further processing.
   
2. Update the `simplify` logic to better handle cases where terms have equivalent but differently represented exponents.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. **File `sympy/core/power.py`**:
   - Locate the `eval` method inside the `Pow` class.
   - Before returning the evaluated power expression, add logic to convert floating-point exponents to rational exponents.

2. **File `sympy/core/expr.py`** (Responsibility: handles expression manipulation and simplification):
   - Locate the main simplification function (likely `simplify` or `_eval_simplify`).
   - Enhance the function to recognize and process exponent terms that have equivalent values but are represented differently.
   - Ensure terms with equivalent exponents are combined correctly to eliminate redundancies.

The implementation does not require creating new files or modifying test files. The focus is on ensuring existing simplification logic can handle different representations of equivalent exponents effectively. Hereâ€™s a brief outline of the changes required:

**File: sympy/core/power.py**
- Ensure the `eval` method in the `Pow` class converts floating-point exponents to rational exponents before further evaluation.

**File: sympy/core/expr.py**
- Update the `simplify` function to handle and combine terms with equivalent exponents, ensuring terms that should cancel out do so effectively.

This should resolve the issue and produce the expected simplification result: zero.
