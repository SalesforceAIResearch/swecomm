**Title**: Handle Non-Pickleable Types in Django Q Object for OR Operator

**Problem**:
Using references to certain non-pickleable types such as `dict_keys` in a `Q` object makes the use of the `|` (OR) operator fail with a `TypeError`. This occurs because the `|` operator attempts to pickle these types, which is not feasible with objects like `dict_keys`.

**Analysis**:
The `Q` object in Django is used for building complex queries by combining multiple query conditions. When combining `Q` objects using the `|` operator, Python attempts to serialize the objects. Non-pickleable types such as `dict_keys` cause this process to fail, resulting in a `TypeError`.

The underlying issue can be addressed by modifying the `Q` object to convert non-pickleable types into equivalent pickleable types before the serialization process begins. For instance, converting `dict_keys` to a list can make them pickleable.

The change should be handled within the `Q` object class, specifically in the method where operands are combined using the `|` operator.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/query_utils.py`
    - **Method**: Inside the relevant method(s) where `|` (OR) operations are processed within the `Q` object.
      
**Detailed Changes**:
- Identify the method in the `Q` class responsible for handling the `|` operator.
- Introduce a helper function to convert non-pickleable types to their pickleable equivalents.
    - This function should check the type of the operand and, if necessary, convert it. For example, check if it's a `dict_keys` object and convert it to a list.
- Apply this helper function to the Q object's arguments before performing the OR operation.

By making these adjustments, non-pickleable types such as `dict_keys` will be converted to a compatible format, preventing the `TypeError` and allowing the `|` operator to function as expected.

These changes should be validated by running existing tests, and if necessary, new tests should be written to cover cases involving non-pickleable types in Q objects.

This approach ensures that existing functionality remains unaffected while extending compatibility to handle previously problematic types.
