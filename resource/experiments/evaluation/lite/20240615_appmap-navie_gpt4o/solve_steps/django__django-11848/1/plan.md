**Title**: Update Year Parsing Logic in parse_http_date to Comply with RFC 7231

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `parse_http_date` function in `django.utils.http` incorrectly processes two-digit years by hardcoding the interpretation of these years. Specifically, it assumes that two-digit years from 0-69 are in the 2000-2069 range and 70-99 are in the 1970-1999 range. RFC 7231 dictates that two-digit years should be interpreted based on the current year, where years that appear more than 50 years in the future should be considered the most recent past year that ends with the same last two digits.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is the hardcoded logic for converting two-digit years provided in the HTTP date to a four-digit year. This logic does not dynamically consider the current year. Instead, it statically assumes certain ranges, which can lead to incorrect date interpretations as specified by the updated RFC 7231 guidelines.

To fix this, we need to adjust the year conversion logic to be dynamic. The correct approach is to calculate the current year and determine if the parsed two-digit year falls within the acceptable future or past range.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `parse_http_date` function in the `django/utils/http.py` file to dynamically interpret two-digit years using the current year. 

1. **File**: `django/utils/http.py`

   - Modify the `parse_http_date` function to replace the hardcoded year conversion logic with a dynamic approach that takes the current year into consideration.

   - Calculate the current year dynamically.
   
   - Determine the full year for two-digit years by checking if adding 100 years causes the year to be more than 50 years in the future. If so, adjust to the most recent past year.

Suggested approach:
1. Calculate the current year.
2. Define the boundary year as current year + 50.
3. Adjust the conversion logic:
    - If the two-digit year is more than 50 years from the boundary year, consider it as part of the previous century.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Retrieve the Current Year**: Use `datetime.datetime.utcnow()` to fetch the current year.
2. **Boundary Calculation**: Define the boundary as the current year + 50.
3. **Year Conversion**: Adjust the year conversion logic to check if the two-digit year is more than 50 years ahead of the boundary.

Example Logic:
- For years between `00-49`, consider them as `2000 + year` if within the 50-year window, otherwise `1900 + year`.
- For years between `50-99`, consider them as `1900 + year`.

These changes involve modifying the conditional statements nested within the try-except block to replace the old fixed logic.

**Example of how to modify**:

1. Modify `parse_http_date` logic to dynamically handle the two-digit year check:

   

By updating the function as described above, this will ensure that the two-digit years are interpreted per RFC 7231 requirements, complying with the protocol, and correctly handling date formats interpreted from HTTP headers.
