**Title**: Resolve "no number is assigned for table" Warnings in `numref` Logic

**Problem**: 
After upgrading to Sphinx 3.3, warnings stating "no number is assigned for table" appear during builds using `singlehtml` or `latex`. This issue likely stems from recent changes in the `numref` logic that assigns numbers to labeled content such as tables but fails to do so correctly.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this problem appears to be within the `numref` logic that assigns numbers to tables. In Sphinx, labels referenced in `numref` should have an associated number when `numfig` is enabled. This process involves determining the node type of the labeled element (table, figure, etc.) and retrieving the figure number. If the node type is detected incorrectly or `numfig` configuration is not properly respected, it can lead to the warning "no number is assigned for table."

Examining the provided code snippets, the likely point of failure is within the method responsible for resolving the references, most notably:

1. **Fetching the node type (`figtype`) of the labeled element**.
2. **Checking if numbering is enabled for that node type**.
3. **Attempting to fetch the figure number for the specific node**.

Any errors or omissions in this sequence could result in the warning described.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Focus on the file **sphinx/domains/std.py**. Modify the logic within the `_resolve_numref_xref` and `_resolve_ref_xref` methods to ensure that:
1. **Node types are correctly identified**.
2. **Numbering configuration (e.g., `numfig`) is appropriately respected**.
3. **Errors in fetching or missing figure numbers are adequately handled**.

### Detailed Suggested Changes

#### File: `sphinx/domains/std.py`

1. **Update `_resolve_numref_xref` Method**:

   - Ensure that the node type is correctly identified and associated with the correct figtype.
   - Respect the `numfig` configuration setting.
   - Handle scenarios where the figure number cannot be fetched gracefully, avoiding unwarranted warnings.



2. **Update `_resolve_ref_xref` Method**:

   - Ensure the reference resolution for `numref` includes correct node type checking and respects the `numfig` setting.



#### Example of key segments that need to be updated:
- `sphinx/domains/std.py:826-844`: Segment handling the build of reference nodes.
- `sphinx/domains/std.py:841-863`: Segment to handle specific scenarios where `numfig` is disabled and manage the warning output.

By updating these logic points within the mentioned functions and handling errors more gracefully while respecting configurations, the warning "no number is assigned for table" should be resolved. This will ensure the stability of your documentation builds with Sphinx 3.3.
