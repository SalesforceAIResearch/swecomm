**Title: Correct 0**-oo Evaluation to Return ComplexInfinity (zoo)**

**Problem**: The current implementation of the `Pow` class in SymPy returns `0` for the expression `0**-oo` (zero to the power of negative infinity). According to the documented behavior, it should return `ComplexInfinity` (zoo).

**Analysis**:
The problem arises in the logic that handles the special case where the base is zero, and the exponent is negative infinity. Currently, this logic does not correctly identify and handle the arithmetic principle that zero raised to a negative infinite power leads to an unbounded result, warranting the return value as `ComplexInfinity`.

To resolve this, it is necessary to inspect and alter the conditional checks within the `Pow` class to correctly evaluate and return `ComplexInfinity` for the expression `0**-oo`.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Adjust logic in `sympy/core/power.py` where the `Pow` class and its `__new__` method handle the evaluation of power expressions. Specifically, updates should be made to include a check for the specific case where the base is zero and the exponent is `-oo`. In such cases, it should return `ComplexInfinity`.

1. **`sympy/core/power.py`**:
   - Locate the `Pow` class definition.
   - Within the `__new__` method of the `Pow` class, identify the section that handles special cases and edge cases.
   - Insert a conditional check to identify when the base is `0` and the exponent is `-oo` (which can be done using `S.Zero` and `S.NegativeInfinity`).
   - Update this conditional to return `S.ComplexInfinity` when the condition is met.

The updated logic might follow the pattern:
- If `base == S.Zero and exp == S.NegativeInfinity: return S.ComplexInfinity`

Description of the change:
- This adjustment ensures that the evaluation aligns with the documented expectations and mathematical conventions for handling zero raised to negative infinite power.

By applying the proposed changes, the expression `0**-oo` will correctly yield `ComplexInfinity` (zoo) in accordance with the documentation and mathematical principles.
