**Title**: Add draggable keyword to Legend initialization

**Problem**: Currently, there is no keyword in the `__init__` function of the `Legend` class that allows users to make the legend draggable at its creation. This requires users to call the `set_draggable` method after the legend has been created, which is less convenient.

**Analysis**: To support a `draggable` keyword during the initialization of the `Legend` class, we need to understand how the `set_draggable` method works and integrate it into the `__init__` method. By doing this, users can specify whether they want the legend to be draggable directly during its instantiation. This will require adding an additional parameter to the `__init__` method and modifying the initialization logic to check and set this parameter appropriately.

The `set_draggable` method is called to make the legend box draggable by the user. Incorporating this functionality during initialization will streamline the user experience and make the API more intuitive. We will ensure that the `draggable` parameter has no effect if set to `False` (default behavior).

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`
   - **Class `Legend` initialization**:
     1. Add a `draggable` keyword argument to the `__init__` method of the `Legend` class, defaulting to `False`.
     2. Modify the initialization logic to call the `set_draggable` method if the `draggable` argument is set to `True`.

   Detailed steps:
   - Locate the `__init__` method in the `Legend` class.
   - Add a new optional parameter named `draggable` with a default value of `False`.
   - At the end of the `__init__` method, check the value of the `draggable` parameter. If it is `True`, call `self.set_draggable(True)`.

By implementing these changes, users will be able to create a draggable legend directly by specifying `draggable=True` when they instantiate the `Legend` class. This enhancement will improve user experience by reducing the number of steps required to achieve a common use case.
