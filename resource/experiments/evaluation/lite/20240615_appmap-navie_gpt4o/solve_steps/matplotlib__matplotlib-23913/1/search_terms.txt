### Feature request

**There is not keyword to make legend draggable at creation**

<!--A short 1-2 sentences that succinctly describes the bug-->

Is there a code reason why one can not add a "draggable=True" keyword to the __init__ function for Legend?  This would be more handy than having to call it after legend creation.  And, naively, it would seem simple to do.  But maybe there is a reason why it would not work?
