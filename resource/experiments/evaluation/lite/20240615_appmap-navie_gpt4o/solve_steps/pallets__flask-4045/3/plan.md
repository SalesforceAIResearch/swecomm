**Title**: Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot.

**Problem**: The current implementation does not raise an error when a blueprint's name contains a dot. This is problematic because dots are now significant due to the possibility of nested blueprints. While an error already exists for endpoint names containing dots, one should have been added for blueprint names as well.

**Analysis**: When a blueprint object is created and registered, it should immediately be validated to ensure that the name does not contain any dots. This is important as dots have special significance in nested blueprints, and allowing dots in names could lead to unintended behaviors or conflicts.

The logical place to introduce this check is in the initialization of the `Blueprint` class. This is because it's best to validate the blueprint name as early as possible, preferably when the blueprint object is being created.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `src/flask/blueprints.py`

    - **Function to Modify**: `__init__`
    
    - **Modification Description**:
    
      1. In the `Blueprint` class, locate the `__init__` method.
      2. Add a validation check to raise an assertion error if the blueprint's name contains a dot.
      3. The assertion message can be: "Blueprint name should not contain dots, as they are reserved for nesting."

**Detailed Steps**:
1. Inside the `Blueprint` class:
    - Locate the `__init__` method.
    - After assigning the `name` parameter to `self.name`, add an assertion that checks if a dot is present in the name.
    - If a dot is found, raise an `AssertionError`.



By implementing this change, an error will be raised as soon as a blueprint with an invalid name is created. This early validation will help prevent conflicts and maintain the integrity of nested blueprints. This focused change will only affect the initialization part of the `Blueprint` class, minimizing the impact on other areas of the codebase.
