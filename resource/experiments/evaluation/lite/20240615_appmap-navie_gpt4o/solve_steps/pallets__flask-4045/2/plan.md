### Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot

#### Problem
Blueprints in Flask now support nesting by using dots in their names. However, using dots in blueprint names can create confusion and unexpected behavior. While there is already a check for endpoint names to prevent dots, namings of blueprints themselves with dots should also be restricted.

#### Analysis
The issue at hand requires preventing users from naming blueprints with dots (".") in their names. We should add a validation to the Blueprint class constructor to check if the name contains a dot and raise a `ValueError` if it does.

Steps to solve the issue:
1. Add a validation check in the `Blueprint` class's `__init__` method.
2. If the name contains a dot, raise a `ValueError`, clearly stating the restriction.

#### Proposed Changes
Modify the `__init__` method in the `Blueprint` class located in `src/flask/blueprints.py`. The validation would involve checking if the name contains a dot and raising an error if it does.

- **File**: `src/flask/blueprints.py`
  - **Function**: `__init__`
    - **Change**: Add a validation to check if the blueprint name contains a dot.
    - **Logic**: After initializing `self.name`, add a check using an `if` statement to see if the name contains a dot. If true, raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.

Detailed steps:
1. Open `src/flask/blueprints.py`.
2. Locate the `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class.
3. Add the following validation logic right after the name is set (`self.name = name`):
    

This ensures that any blueprint initialized with a name containing a dot will result in an immediate, clear error, preventing potential issues with nested names.

Make sure to review the entire class to ensure there are no other areas where a similar check might be necessary. This change only modifies non-test code and is focused on a single, specific file to maintain simplicity and clarity.
