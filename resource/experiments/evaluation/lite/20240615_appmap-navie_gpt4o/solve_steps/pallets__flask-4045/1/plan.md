**Title**: Raise error when blueprint name contains a dot

**Problem**: Dot characters in blueprint names can cause conflicts and misinterpretations due to the significance of dots in nested blueprints and endpoint names. There is already an error for endpoint names containing dots, but a similar error for blueprint names was missed.

**Analysis**: Blueprints are a way to organize related components in a Flask application. They can be nested, where the dot (.) is a delimiter used to signify nesting. However, having a dot in a blueprint name itself can lead to ambiguity and potential conflicts, especially since endpoint names can contain the blueprint name. Thus, it is necessary to ensure that blueprint names do not contain dots.

To address this issue, we need to add validation logic that checks if the provided blueprint name contains a dot. If it does, an error should be raised immediately to inform the developer of the invalid blueprint name.

**Proposed Changes**: We will modify the constructor of the `Blueprint` class in the `src/flask/blueprints.py` file to include a validation step that raises an error if the blueprint name contains a dot.

1. Locate the `Blueprint` classâ€™s `__init__` method in `src/flask/blueprints.py`.
2. Add a validation check for the `name` parameter to ensure it does not contain a dot.
3. Raise an appropriate `ValueError` with a clear error message if the `name` contains a dot.

**Detailed Changes**:

Modify the constructor of the `Blueprint` class to add a validation check for the `name` parameter:

**src/flask/blueprints.py**
1. Open the `__init__` method of the `Blueprint` class.
2. Add the following validation logic at the beginning of the constructor:
   - Check if the `name` parameter contains a dot by using the `in` operator.
   - If a dot is found, raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that the blueprint name should not contain dots.

This update will ensure that any blueprint created with a name containing a dot will immediately raise an error, preventing potential conflicts and ambiguities later in the application lifecycle.
