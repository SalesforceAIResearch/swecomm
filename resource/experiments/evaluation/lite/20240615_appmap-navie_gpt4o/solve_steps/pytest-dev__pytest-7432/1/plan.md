**Title**: Fix `--runxfail` Bug in `pytest_runtest_makereport` for Correct Skip Location Reporting

**Problem**: 
When using `@pytest.mark.skip` or `@pytest.mark.skipif` to skip a test, the reported skip location should refer to the specific test item itself. However, if the `--runxfail` flag is used, the skip location erroneously reports the location within the `src/_pytest/skipping.py` file instead of the test function.

**Analysis**:
The core issue lies in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook implementation. The `--runxfail` flag should only affect tests marked with `xfail` and should not alter the location reporting for skipped tests. The current implementation mistakenly changes the skip location logic when the `--runxfail` flag is present, leading to the reported bug.

To address this, we need to ensure that the location of the skip marker is correctly preserved and reported, regardless of the presence of the `--runxfail` flag. This requires evaluating the conditions under which the skip marker's location is overridden and making sure the logic respects the correct source location.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `src/_pytest/skipping.py`
   * **Function**: `pytest_runtest_makereport`
   
   - **Current Logic**:
     
   - **Proposed Change**:
     Modify this section to ensure the location is correctly set even when `--runxfail` is used:
     - Check the logic for `--runxfail` condition and appropriately skip altering the skip marker location.
     - Ensure the conditions accurately differentiate between `xfail` and `skip` markers so that `--runxfail` does not interfere with `skip` marker's logic.

2. **Detailed Changes**:
   - Within the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function:
     - Ensure that the correct conditions are checked for `skip` without being affected by `--runxfail`.
     - Properly maintain the location for `skip` markers by adjusting the checks and assignments within the code block.

Focus on ensuring that the reported location for skipped tests remains the location of the test item itself, unaffected by the `--runxfail` flag. Make sure the logic only adjusts for `xfail` conditions without interfering with `skip` conditions.

Beyond these core changes, no additional modifications to test files or new files are necessary.
