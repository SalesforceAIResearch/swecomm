**Title**: Fix IndexError in LogisticRegressionCV when refit=False by handling the indexing properly

**Problem**: 
When `LogisticRegressionCV` is used with `refit=False`, an `IndexError` is thrown. This error occurs during the calculation of the coefficient paths when attempting to average the coefficients over the folds. Specifically, the error "too many indices for array" is raised.

**Analysis**:
The problem lies in the retrieval of coefficient paths during the cross-validation process within the `fit` method of `LogisticRegressionCV`. When `refit=False`, the algorithm tries to compute the mean of the coefficients over the folds without performing a proper indexing check, causing an `IndexError`.

The core of the problem is located in the following snippet within the `fit` method:

If `refit=False`, the `coefs_paths` array may not have the expected dimensions, leading to issues with the indexing.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Add a conditional check to ensure that the indexing operation on `coefs_paths` does not lead to out-of-bound errors.
- Properly handle the shape and dimensions of `coefs_paths` to avoid `IndexError` when `refit=False`.

**File**: `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`

**Function**: Modify the `fit` method in the `LogisticRegressionCV` class.

### Detailed Steps:
1. **Check the `refit` parameter and dimensions**: Verify whether `refit` is set to `False`. If so, handle the dimensions of `coefs_paths` cautiously to avoid indexing issues.
2. **Properly Compute Mean Coefficients**:
   - Ensure that the dimensions of `coefs_paths` are compatible with the indexing.
   - Safely retrieve the coefficients from `coefs_paths` with appropriate checks.

#### Implementation Plan:
1. **Locate the fit method** in the `LogisticRegressionCV` class within `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`.
2. **Find the segment** where coefficients are averaged:
   
3. **Modify the code** to handle the dimensions correctly:
   - Add a check to verify the shape of `coefs_paths` before performing the mean operation.
   - Ensure robust indexing to prevent out-of-bound errors.

**Proposed Code Changes**:


By following these steps, we successfully address the `IndexError` issue when `refit=False` is used with `LogisticRegressionCV`, ensuring that the dimensions and indexing operations are handled correctly. This change will make the code robust against unexpected shape variations in the coefficient paths.
