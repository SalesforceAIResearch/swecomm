**Title:** Fix IndexError in LogisticRegressionCV when refit=False

**Problem:**
When attempting to estimate a regularization parameter through cross-validation using `LogisticRegressionCV` with `refit` set to `False`, an `IndexError` is thrown due to an improper indexing operation.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the problem lies in how the code handles the coefficients' path when not refitting the classifiers. Specifically, the problematic portion is causing an `IndexError` because the code is trying to access more indices than available in the `coefs_paths` array. 

The array `coefs_paths` dimensions differ based on whether refitting is done or not. When `refit` is set to `False`, the array handling must be appropriately adjusted to avoid over-indexing.

**Proposed Changes:**
To address the issue, modifications are required in the handling of `coefs_paths` when `refit` is set to `False`. The relevant code resides in the `fit` method of `LogisticRegressionCV`. The necessary changes should be made in the `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py` file. Here's a detailed description of the required changes:

1. **File:** `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`
   - **Function:** `LogisticRegressionCV.fit`
   - **Modification:**
     - Update the computation of `w` to correctly handle the case when `refit` is `False`.

The suggested changes are as follows:

1. **In the logic where `refit` is `False`:**
   - Modify the line that uses `coefs_paths` array such that it does not attempt to index more dimensions than exist.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Locate the logic where `refit` is handled:



2. Update it to correctly handle cases without `refit`:

2.1 Update the code segment involved in computation of `w`:

Instead of:

It should correctly limit the indexing:



2.2 Also, ensure that `coefs_paths` and `best_indices` are handled correctly when they are used without `refit`:



These changes should effectively prevent over-indexing and handle arrays of different shapes when `refit` is disabled.

**By implementing these changes in `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`, you should be able to resolve the IndexError and correctly handle cross-validation without refitting.**
