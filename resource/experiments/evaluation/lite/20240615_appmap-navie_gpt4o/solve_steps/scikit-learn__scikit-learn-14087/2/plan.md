**Title:** Fix `IndexError` in LogisticRegressionCV when `refit=False`

**Problem:**
An `IndexError` is thrown in the `LogisticRegressionCV` class when attempting to estimate a regularization parameter via cross-validation with `refit` set to `False`. The issue occurs because the code attempts to access indices in an array that may not have the consistent dimensions expected when the `refit` parameter is set to `False`.

**Analysis:**
Upon analyzing the issue, it's clear that the problem occurs in the `fit` method of `LogisticRegressionCV`. When `refit=False`, the array `coefs_paths[:, i, best_indices[i], :]` doesn't have the expected dimensions because the best indices (`best_indices`) are being computed even though the refit is not performed on each fold. 

The root of the problem lies in this section:


For `refit=False`, the coefficients of the logistic regression should not rely on `best_indices` because `best_indices` assumes that refitting happens, which it does not. Instead, the code should directly use the cross-validated results without assuming `best_indices`.

**Proposed Changes:**

File: `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`

1. Modify the `fit` method in `LogisticRegressionCV` class to include a condition that handles the case when `refit=False`.
  
2. Instead of computing `best_indices` and using them directly, ensure that the coefficients are determined based on cross-validation results without refitting.

Here's a detailed description of the changes:

- Add a conditional check to see if `refit` is `False`.
- If `refit` is `False`, handle the cross-validated results directly without causing an `IndexError`.

Detailed steps:

1. In `sklearn/linear_model/logistic.py`, locate the `LogisticRegressionCV` class.
2. Find the `fit` method.
3. Update the section where `w` is calculated, introducing a check for `self.refit`.
4. If `self.refit` is `False`, adjust the calculation to handle cross-validation results appropriately without referencing `best_indices`.

By updating the `fit` method as suggested, `LogisticRegressionCV` should correctly handle cases where `refit=False` without throwing an `IndexError`.

These changes should fix the issue, allowing users to estimate regularization parameters without refitting the model in each fold, and preventing the potential `IndexError`.
