Wrong Derivative kind attribute
I'm playing around with the `kind` attribute.

The following is correct:

```
from sympy import Integral, Derivative
from sympy import MatrixSymbol
from sympy.abc import x
A = MatrixSymbol('A', 2, 2)
i = Integral(A, x)
i.kind
# MatrixKind(NumberKind)
```

This one is wrong:
```
d = Derivative(A, x)
d.kind
# UndefinedKind
```

</issue>
