### Title
Correct `kind` Attribute for `Derivative` Objects

### Problem
The `Derivative` object in SymPy is returning `UndefinedKind` for its `kind` attribute when differentiating a matrix, although it should return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` like the `Integral` object does.

### Analysis
The `kind` attribute should represent the mathematical classification of the entities involved in the expression. The `Integral` object correctly infers the kind of a `MatrixSymbol` but `Derivative` fails to do so, returning `UndefinedKind` instead of the expected `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. This discrepancy likely arises because the method defining the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` objects does not properly handle matrix symbols.

The `Derivative` object's `kind` attribute should reflect the kind of the object being differentiated. Specifically, if the variable being differentiated is a matrix, the resulting kind should retain the matrix's type with appropriate elements' kind being `NumberKind`.

### Proposed Changes
#### File: sympy/core/trace.py
1. **Method: `kind`**
   - Modify the `kind` method of `Derivative` to correctly infer the kind when differentiating matrix expressions.

#### Adjustments:
1. **File: sympy/core/trace.py: Line ??? (assumed to be within the class `Derivative`)**
   - Modify the `kind` method to check whether the expression being differentiated is a matrix. If it is a matrix, return the appropriate `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`.

#### Detailed Steps:
1. **Locate the `Derivative` class** within `sympy/core/trace.py`.
2. **Update the `kind` method** to handle matrix differentiation:
   - **Check if the expression is a MatrixKind**.
   - Return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` if it is.

**Example change:**
- Check `if isinstance(expr, MatrixSymbol)` and return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)`. This logic will ensure that derivatives involving matrix symbols are properly classified.

**Note**:
- Ensure proper imports if needed, such as `MatrixKind` and `NumberKind`.

Once these changes are made, the `kind` attribute for `Derivative` objects involving matrix symbols should correctly return `MatrixKind(NumberKind)` instead of `UndefinedKind`.
