**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

inspectdb should generate related_name on same relation links.
Description
	
Hi!
After models generation with inspectdb command we have issue with relations to same enities
module.Model.field1: (fields.E304) Reverse accessor for 'module.Model.field1' clashes with reverse accessor for 'module.Model.field2'.
HINT: Add or change a related_name argument to the definition for 'module.Model.field1' or 'module.Model.field2'.
*
Maybe we can autogenerate
related_name='attribute_name'
to all fields in model if related Model was used for this table
