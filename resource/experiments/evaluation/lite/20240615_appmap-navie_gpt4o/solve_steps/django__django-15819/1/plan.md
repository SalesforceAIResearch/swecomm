**Title**: Generate related_name for fields automatically in inspectdb to avoid clashes

**Problem**:
When using the `inspectdb` command in Django to generate models from an existing database schema, there is an issue where relations to the same entities can cause clashing reverse accessors. This results in errors like `(fields.E304) Reverse accessor for 'module.Model.field1' clashes with reverse accessor for 'module.Model.field2'.` The solution proposed is to auto-generate the `related_name` argument for fields in models to avoid such clashes.

**Analysis**:
The `inspectdb` command, which is located in `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`, inspects the database tables and generates the corresponding Django model definitions. When it encounters foreign key relationships (or other relationships), it generates fields in the model. However, if there are multiple fields referring to the same related model, Django needs unique `related_name` attributes for the reverse accessors to avoid clashes.

To fix this, we should modify the code in `inspectdb` to automatically generate unique `related_name` attributes for each field referring to the same related model. This will ensure there are no clashes and make the generated models ready to use without further manual adjustment.

**Proposed Changes**:
The main changes will be in the `inspectdb` command logic, specifically where it handles the generation of model fields with relationship attributes.

1. Modify `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`:
   - In the section of the code where it inspects and generates fields, track the related models used within each model.
   - For each foreign key (or related field), generate a unique `related_name` to avoid any clashes. This could be in the format `"{field_name}_related"` or similar.

2. Process for modifying the file:
   - Identify where the relationships are being inspected and fields are being created.
   - Insert logic to generate unique `related_name` properties for fields pointing to the same related model.
   
   Suggested changes in the file:
   - Add a helper function to generate the `related_name` value.
   - Track and assign unique `related_name` attributes for each relationship field in the model generation process.

The specific lines of code and functions within `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py` will be adjusted as follows:

- **Function**: `def add_arguments(self, parser)`
  - **Modification**: No changes needed here.

- **Function**: The section responsible for generating the field definitions and handling relationships.
  - **Modification details**: Introduce logic to generate unique `related_name` values.

Steps:
1. Add a helper function for generating a unique `related_name`.
2. Modify the part of the code where related fields are added to the generated model to include the `related_name`.

Example modification points:
- Track usage of related models within each generated model.
- Assign unique `related_name` to each related field to avoid clashes.

These modifications ensure that when the `inspectdb` command runs, it auto-generates `related_name` attributes in the model fields, thus preventing clashes with reverse accessors.

Final detailed change suggestions:
- [Function]: Inside the main logic responsible for generating model fields in `inspectdb`.
  - Track each model's related fields.
  - Ensure unique `related_name` entries.

By following these changes, the `inspectdb` command will handle model generation smoothly without clashing reverse accessors, thereby creating functional and error-free models directly from the database schema.
