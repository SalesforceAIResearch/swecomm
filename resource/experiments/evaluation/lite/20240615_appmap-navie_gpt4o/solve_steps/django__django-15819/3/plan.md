**Title**: Update `inspectdb` to auto-generate `related_name` for relations to the same models

**Problem**
When generating Django models from an existing database using the `inspectdb` command, the generated models may have reverse accessor conflicts when they have multiple fields related to the same model. This results in errors like:

To resolve this, we should auto-generate unique `related_name` attributes for such fields.

**Analysis**
The issue arises because Django, by default, creates a reverse accessor name for relations (foreign keys, one-to-one, etc.) that may clash if multiple relations to the same model exist. To avoid this, we need to ensure that each related field in the generated models has a unique `related_name`.

The `inspectdb` command generates these models dynamically based on the database schema, so the solution involves modifying the code in `inspectdb` that generates the field definitions, adding a unique `related_name` when necessary.

To implement this:

1. Identify relevant parts of the code where model fields are generated.
2. Check if a field introduces a relation to another model.
3. Ensure a unique `related_name` if it conflicts with others.

**Proposed Changes**
Focus on appending `related_name` attributes to the fields in the generated code by updating the `inspectdb` command:

1. **File to Modify**: `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`
   - Identify where the field definitions are generated and modify the field generation logic to include a `related_name` if needed.
   
   - **Function to Modify**: The function responsible for generating model fields (likely within the method that parses the database schema).
   
   - **Logic Change**:
     - Extract relationships being created.
     - Track the fields and their related models.
     - If a field introduces a relation to a model that already has a relation from this model, generate a unique `related_name`.
     - Add the `related_name` attribute to the field definition string.

**Detailed Steps for `inspectdb` logic modification:**

1. During the generation of field definitions after identifying it as a relationship:
   - Introduce a tracking mechanism, such as a dictionary keyed by the related model, listing all related fields.
   - For each related field, check if the related model already exists in the dictionary.
   - If so, generate a unique `related_name` (e.g., `related_name='field1_related'`).
   - Append the `related_name` to the field definition.

2. Ensure new `related_name` values do not conflict with other fields or existing model attributes.

Example steps within the file:
- Modify `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`:
  - Locate the code logic where fields are parsed and generated, and identify if it's a relationship.
  - Implement a check for existing relationships pointing to the same model.
  - Generate a related name that resolves conflicts and embed this related name in the field definition string.

By following these steps, you'll resolve the issue of clashing reverse accessors in dynamically generated models from `inspectdb`, thereby preventing the need for manual adjustments post-generation.
