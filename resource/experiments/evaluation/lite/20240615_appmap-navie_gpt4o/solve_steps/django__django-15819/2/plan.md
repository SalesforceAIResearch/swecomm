**Title: Update `inspectdb` Command to Autogenerate `related_name` for Fields with Same Relation Links**

**Problem:**
When using the `inspectdb` command to generate Django models from an existing database schema, there is an issue where fields that have relations to the same entities can cause reverse accessor clashes. The generated model code triggers errors such as:

The proposed solution is to autogenerate the `related_name` attribute for all relevant fields if the related Model was used for this table.

**Analysis:**
- The `inspectdb` management command introspects the existing database schema and generates Django model code corresponding to the discovered tables and relations.
- The error arises because Django does not allow multiple ForeignKey fields pointing to the same model without specifying a `related_name` to distinguish the reverse relations.
- Autogenerating the `related_name` can help in preventing clashes by providing a unique identifier for each reverse relation.

To fix this:
1. Modify the `inspectdb` command to generate and append a unique `related_name` to each ForeignKey field definition that points to the same model.
2. Ensure that the generated `related_name` is unique for each field to prevent clashes.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File:** `django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py`

   **Change:**
   - In the logic that generates model fields, identify cases where multiple fields reference the same model.
   - Generate a unique `related_name` using a naming convention like `related_name='related_<related_model_name>_<field_name>'`.
   - Append this `related_name` attribute to the corresponding ForeignKey field definitions.

   **Specific Modifications:**
   - Enhance the `handle_inspection` method to keep track of fields pointing to the same model.
   - Within the method that constructs the field definitions, check for clashes and append `related_name` where needed.

   **Detailed Implementation Steps:**

   - **Step 1:** Track all relations for each model during inspection.
   - **Step 2:** When generating the model field definitions, check for multiple relations pointing to the same model.
   - **Step 3:** If such a relation is found, append a uniquely generated `related_name`.

Here’s a more detailed description of the changes:
- **Identify and Track Relations:** As each table and its fields are introspected, maintain a mapping of relations from fields to their related models.
- **Generate Unique `related_name`:** For any field that points to a model already referenced by another field, generate a `related_name` using the pattern `related_<related_model_name>_<field_name>`.
- **Modify Field Definition:** Append the `related_name` to the definition of each ForeignKey field that needs it.

**Note:** The implementation should avoid altering the user’s original schema design while ensuring that the generated models adhere to Django’s requirements.

By making these changes, the `inspectdb` command will avoid reverse accessor clashes and provide more ready-to-use models generated from existing databases.
