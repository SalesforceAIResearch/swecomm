### Title
Fix inheritance of annotation-only members in autodoc

### Problem
In Sphinx's autodoc extension, annotation-only members in superclass are treated as "undocumented" when using the `:inherited-members:` option in the `autoclass` directive. This causes them to not be shown unless the `:undoc-members:` option is also provided.

### Analysis
The autodoc extension is responsible for generating documentation for Python code, including classes. When using `:inherited-members:`, it should display members inherited from superclasses. However, if a class attribute is defined using type annotations only (without assigning a value), such as `attr1: int` in the example, it is treated as "undocumented" unless the `:undoc-members:` option is used.

The root cause is that the attribute is being filtered out during the documentation generation process because it lacks a docstring directly associated with its declaration. This behavior can be traced back to how autodoc processes and filters members of classes.

### Proposed Changes
The changes should focus on modifying the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file to ensure annotation-only members are not treated as undocumented when inherited.

1. **Modify the filtering logic in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`:**
   - Ensure that annotation-only inherited members are considered as documented.
   - Adjust the conditions that check if a member should be included based on the options `:members:`, `:inherited-members:`, and `:undoc-members:`.

2. **Enhance Member Inspection:**
   - Update the member inspection code to correctly identify and include annotation-only members from superclasses as documented members.

Specific steps:

1. **Locate Class Member Filtering Logic:**
   - Find the section where members of a class are collected and filtered, specifically focusing on the handling of inheritance and documentation status.

2. **Update Filtering Condition:**
   - Ensure that the logic to determine if a member is considered "documented" includes cases where the member is defined by type annotations in a superclass.

The affected function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` might look similar to:


### Example Adjustment:
- Within the inspection or filtering stage, add checks to include type-annotated members even if they lack an explicit docstring in the initial class definition.

3. **Test Coverage:**
   - Confirm the changes by checking if annotation-only members from superclasses are now included without needing `:undoc-members:`.

Adjust these principles according to the actual code structure and naming in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`.

### Expected Outcome
With these changes, annotation-only members in superclasses should be documented when using the `:inherited-members:` option, without needing the `:undoc-members:` option. This will ensure a more consistent and predictable documentation behavior.

### Proposed Changes

1. **File:** `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`
   - Locate and modify the member filtering logic to include annotation-only members from superclasses regardless of the presence of docstrings.
   - Specifically, modify the logic that checks if a member is considered "documented" to account for type annotations.

By implementing the above changes, we aim to resolve the issue where annotation-only members in superclasses are treated as "undocumented" and hence not shown in the documentation when using `:inherited-members:`.
