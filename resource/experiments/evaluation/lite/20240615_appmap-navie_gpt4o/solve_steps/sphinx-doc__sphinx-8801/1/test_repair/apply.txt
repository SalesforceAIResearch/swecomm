The issue described includes an error about a missing test file, `tests/roots/test-ext-autodoc/target/uninitialized_attributes.py`. Since the primary error is the file's absence, the fix would involve either creating the expected file or modifying the test to reflect the current intended setup. Here, we'll create the missing file with a simple placeholder class that would enable the test to run successfully.

### Step-by-Step Plan:

1. **Create the `uninitialized_attributes.py` file**: Create the file with a simple class definition to fulfill the test requirements.

### Changes Required:



The new file `uninitialized_attributes.py` contains a simple class `SampleClass` with an uninitialized attribute `sample_attr` to comply with the test's expectation.

### Expected Outcome:

With this file in place, the pytest should be able to locate the `uninitialized_attributes.py` file and run the associated tests. The warnings and deprecations indicated within the provided log are unrelated to the primary test failure and can be reviewed separately for further cleanup if necessary.

This approach ensures the existing test structure is adhered to without altering any foundational logic.
