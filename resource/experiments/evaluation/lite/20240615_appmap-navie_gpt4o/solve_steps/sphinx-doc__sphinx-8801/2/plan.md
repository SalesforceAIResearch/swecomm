**Title: Modify autodoc to Recognize Annotation-only Members in Superclass**

**Problem**

The `autodoc` extension in Sphinx does not document annotation-only members in a superclass unless the `:undoc-members:` option is provided. In the given example, the attribute `attr1` in class `Foo` is not being documented when class `Bar` inherits from it. This indicates that `autodoc` is treating `attr1` as "undocumented," which is incorrect behavior.

**Analysis**

In Sphinx, the `autodoc` extension is responsible for automatically generating documentation from docstrings. The issue arises when annotation-only members (i.e., attributes specified with type hints but without an explicit value) in a superclass are not documented unless the `:undoc-members:` option is used. The current logic seems to treat these members as undocumented due to a gap in how Sphinx handles the member attributes, particularly in the inheritance chain.

The problem likely stems from how `autodoc` retrieves and processes members of classes. Specifically, it might not correctly identify and include annotation-only members from superclasses when processing inherited members. This necessitates changes to ensure that such members are treated as documented if they exist in the superclass.

**Proposed Changes**

We'll need to modify the file `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`, which contains the logic for obtaining and processing class members. The goal is to ensure that annotation-only members in superclasses are correctly recognized as documented members.

1. **Modify `get_class_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`:**
   - Update logic to correctly identify and include annotation-only members from superclasses.
   - Ensure that these members are not ignored or treated as undocumented when the `:inherited-members:` option is provided.

2. **Update logic in `get_object_members` function for consistency:**
   - Ensure that the identification and retrieval of annotation-only members are correctly handled in both retrieving general object members and class members specifically.

### Detailed Proposed Changes

1. **Modify `get_class_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` (Lines around 245-265):**

   - Enhance the logic that processes members directly defined in the class to ensure annotation-only members in the superclass are correctly attached and recognized.



2. **Modify `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` (Lines around 184-210):**

   - Ensure the function correctly combines superclass annotation-only members.



By modifying the functions as detailed above, the `autodoc` extension should now correctly recognize and include annotation-only members from superclasses in its documentation, even without the `:undoc-members:` option. The changes aim to integrate the superclass's annotation-only attributes into the collection of class members, ensuring they are documented correctly when the `:inherited-members:` directive is used.

This will correct the behavior seen in the provided example, where `Bar.attr1` (inherited from `Foo`) will be documented as expected.
