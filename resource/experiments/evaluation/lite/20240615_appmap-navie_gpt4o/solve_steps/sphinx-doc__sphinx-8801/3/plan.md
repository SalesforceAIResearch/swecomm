### Title
Fix inherited annotation-only members being treated as undocumented in autodoc

### Problem
In Sphinx autodoc, annotation-only members in a superclass are being treated as "undocumented" when inheriting classes. Specifically, running the autodoc directive with `:members:` and `:inherited-members:` does not document attributes from a superclass if they have only type annotations and no docstrings directly under them.

### Analysis
The issue arises because the autodoc extension currently fails to recognize annotation-only members in superclasses as documented members. This is due to how autodoc interprets documentation for attributes that do not have a directly attached docstring but do have type annotations and their documentation within the docstring of the class.

In the context provided, it appears that the harness does not properly handle these types of attributes. The logic responsible for processing members needs to be adjusted to consider type annotations that have in-line documentation or that are described in the class docstring itself.

### Proposed Changes
The file `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` appears to contain the relevant logic for parsing class members when generating the documentation. The following changes should be made to address this issue:

1. Modify the logic that identifies whether a member is documented. Specifically, allow for type-annotated members to be recognized as documented even if they don't have a directly attached docstring but are referenced in the class-level docstring or have in-line comments.

2. Ensure that when processing `:inherited-members:`, the type annotations in the superclass are not omitted by including a check for their presence and treating them as valid documented members if in-line comments/docstrings exist.

Modify the function responsible for fetching members in class processing to:
- Include type-annotated members by default.
- Check for in-line annotations and comments to classify them as documented.

### Change Description
#### File: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`

1. **Modify the function/method that processes members**:
   - Identify where the check occurs to see if members are documented.
   - Update the logic to ensure annotation-only members (with comment-based docstrings or mentioned in class docstring) are treated as documented members.

2. **Check Superclass for Annotation-only Members**:
   - In the section where inherited members are processed (likely in the class member handling logic), add code to ensure annotation-only members from superclasses are included even if they lack directly attached docstrings.

Example Pseudocode:
- Locate the class member extraction method.
- When iterating through members:
  - If the member is from a superclass and has a type annotation, treat it as documented if it has an in-line comment or is mentioned in the class-level docstring.

This change ensures that annotation-only members are included in the autodoc-generated documentation when using the `:inherited-members:` option.

By focusing the change on `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, we ensure that the fix is specific and localized, minimizing the risk of side effects in other parts of the system.
