**Title**: Correct Fraction Parsing in `convert_frac` to Include Brackets for Nested Fractions

**Problem**: 
Latex parsing of fractions yields an incorrect expression due to missing brackets around the denominator when it contains nested fractions. The problematic LaTeX expression `"\\frac{\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\frac{1}{c^2}}"` is incorrectly parsed to `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)`, instead of the expected `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`.

**Analysis**: 
The issue appears to be in the parsing logic for fractions within the LaTeX-to-SymPy parser. Specifically, the conversion logic does not correctly introduce brackets around denominators that contain nested fractions. This leads to the ambiguity and incorrect interpretation of the parsed expression.

To fix this, we need to adjust the fraction parsing logic to ensure that brackets are appropriately added around the denominator to maintain the correct mathematical expression. This likely involves modifying the logic within the `convert_frac` function to check if the denominator is complex or nested and wrap it with brackets accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File to Modify**: `sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py`

2. **Function to Modify**: Locate and modify the `convert_frac` function to ensure that it adds brackets around the denominator when nested fractions are present.

3. **Detailed Changes**:
   - **Determine Denominator Complexity**: Within the `convert_frac` function, determine if the denominator contains nested fractions or other complex expressions.
   - **Add Brackets**: If the denominator is complex, ensure that the entire denominator is wrapped in brackets before forming the fraction expression.
   - **Update Fraction Parsing Logic**: Adjust the parsing logic to incorporate these changes, ensuring correct mathematical representation.

**Steps**:
1. **Locate the `convert_frac` function**:
   
  
2. **Define Complexity Check**:
   - You may need to create an auxiliary function to determine the complexity of the expression, i.e., whether it contains nested fractions or other complex constructs.

3. **Adjust Expression Formation**:
   - Ensure that the fraction expression correctly incorporates the bracketed denominator, maintaining accurate mathematical representation.

By implementing these changes, parsing LaTeX fractions with nested elements will yield the correct SymPy expression.
