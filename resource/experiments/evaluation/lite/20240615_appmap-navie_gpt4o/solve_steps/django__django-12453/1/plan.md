### Apply Transactional Atomicity to `deserialize_db_from_string` to Avoid Integrity Errors

#### Problem
The `TransactionTestCase.serialized_rollback` fails to restore objects correctly due to ordering constraints between models with foreign key relationships. The problem arises because `deserialize_db_from_string` deserializes and saves models without using a transaction. This causes integrity errors when an instance containing a foreign key is saved before the instance it references.

#### Analysis
1. When serialized rollback is enabled, the `BaseDatabaseCreation.create_test_db` method stores a serialized version of the current database state in `connection._test_serialized_contents`.
2. The `TransactionTestCase._fixture_setup` method then calls `connection.creation.deserialize_db_from_string(connection._test_serialized_contents)` to restore this state.
3. The serialization process orders models based on natural keys and does not consider foreign key dependencies. As a result, during deserialization, objects might be saved in an order that violates foreign key constraints.
4. The `deserialize_db_from_string` method deserializes objects and saves them to the database without wrapping the operation in a transaction, leading to potential integrity errors.

To address this, it is suggested to wrap the `deserialize_db_from_string` method in a transaction, similar to how `loaddata` does.

#### Proposed Changes
1. Modify the `deserialize_db_from_string` method in the `BaseDatabaseCreation` class to wrap the deserialization and saving process in a transaction.

This minimizes the set of code changes necessary to solve the problem.

##### File: `django/db/backends/base/creation.py`
- **Add a transaction wrapper in `deserialize_db_from_string` method**:
  - Import the `transaction` module from `django.db`.
  - Wrap the loop that deserializes and saves objects in a `transaction.atomic` block.

##### Detailed Description of Changes
1. **Import the Transaction Module**: Add the import statement for `transaction` at the top of the file.
2. **Wrap Deserialization in a Transaction**: Modify the `deserialize_db_from_string` method to include a `with transaction.atomic(using=self.connection.alias):` block around the loop that iterates over deserialized objects and saves them.

By ensuring all deserialization and saving operations occur within a single atomic transaction, we can avoid integrity errors due to object ordering issues.
