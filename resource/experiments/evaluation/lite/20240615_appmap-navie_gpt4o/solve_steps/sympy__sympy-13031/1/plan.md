**Title**: Restore Matrix.hstack() and Matrix.vstack() Behavior for Zero-Row Matrices in Sympy 1.1

**Problem**: 
The behavior of the `Matrix.hstack()` and `Matrix.vstack()` functions have changed in SymPy version 1.1 compared to version 1.0. Specifically, for zero-row matrices, the concatenation results differ. This inconsistency affects the expected behavior and leads to incorrect shapes when stacking such matrices.

**Analysis**:
The issue stems from the handling of zero-row matrices in the `hstack` function. In SymPy 1.0, the horizontal stacking of zero-row matrices (`hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4)`) produced a matrix with zero rows and a number of columns equal to the sum of the columns of the input matrices. However, in SymPy 1.1, this leads to an output matrix that only considers the last matrix's columns in the result.

In SymPy 1.1:
- `hstack()` with zero-row matrices concatenates only the columns from the last argument if none of the matrices have rows.
- For non-zero-row matrices, it works as expected by summing the columns.

The logic needs to be adjusted to account for zero-row matrices and sum their columns correctly during horizontal stacking.

**Proposed Changes**:
The relevant code modification should be made in the `Matrix.hstack()` method in the `dense.py` file. We need to ensure the behavior checks for zero-row matrices and correctly sums the columns.

1. **File**: `dense.py`
   - **Function**: `Matrix.hstack()`

**Detailed Change**:

- **Function**: `concatenate` function inside `hstack`.



We need to iterate over the input matrices, sum their columns, and ensure that the resultant matrix retains this sum when any matrix has zero rows.

This change will restore the previous behavior in SymPy 1.0, where `hstack` would correctly account for the columns in zero-row matrices and return a shape of `(0, total_columns)`.

Make sure to test the `hstack` function with a variety of zero and non-zero row/column matrix combinations to ensure robustness.

With this plan in place, the behavior of `Matrix.hstack()` should align closer to the expectations set by SymPy 1.0, avoiding the regression observed in SymPy 1.1.
