Behavior of Matrix hstack and vstack changed in sympy 1.1
In sympy 1.0:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns 
`(0, 6)`

Now, same in sympy 1.1:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns
`(0, 3)
`
whereas:
```
import sympy as sy
M1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 0)
M2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 1)
M3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 2)
M4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(1, 3)
sy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape
```
returns
`(1, 6)
`
