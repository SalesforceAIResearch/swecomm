**Title**: Fix hstack Behavior for Zero-Dimension Matrices in SymPy

**Problem**: 
In SymPy 1.0, horizontally stacking matrices with a zero dimension using `Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4)` resulted in a matrix with dimensions combining the non-zero elements correctly, even if there were zero rows. Specifically, `Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape` for zero-row matrices returned `(0, 6)`. In SymPy 1.1, the same code returns `(0, 3)`, which indicates that empty matrices do not concatenate dimensions as expected when they have zero rows but non-zero columns.

**Analysis**:
- The update from SymPy 1.0 to 1.1 introduced a change in how `Matrix.hstack` handles matrices with zero rows but non-zero columns.
- `Matrix.hstack` should be compatible with zero-dimension matrices just as it is for matrices with at least one row.
- The goal is to ensure that a horizontal stack correctly concatenates the column dimensions for matrices with zero rows.

**Proposed Changes**: 
To modify the behavior of `Matrix.hstack` for zero-dimension matrices, examine the core implementation of the `hstack` function within the relevant module. 

1. **Locate the `hstack` function in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`:**
   - Identify the part of the function handling matrix concatenation.
   - Modify the function to correctly handle zero-row matrices so that their column dimensions are accurately concatenated even if they feature zero rows.

Suggested Update:

- **sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py**:
  - Examine the handling of matrices with zero rows in the `hstack` and adjust it to accurately concatenate column dimensions.

  Detailed logical updates:
  - When performing the horizontal stack, ensure that if all matrices have zero rows, their column dimensions are concatenated as expected.
  - Update the conditionals to correctly account for zero-row matrices.



By adjusting these parts of the logic, zero-row matrices can be concatenated horizontally to reflect their column dimensions correctly, thus bringing back the behavior seen in SymPy 1.0.
