**Title**: Enhance Simplification of `sin`/`cos` Expressions with Rational Values

**Problem**: The `simplify` method in SymPy is not reducing trigonometric expressions (`sin` and `cos`) involving rational arguments to simpler forms. Specifically, expressions like `sin(1/50)*sin(1/25) + cos(1/50)*cos(1/25)` are not being simplified, even though such simplifications are mathematically feasible.

**Analysis**: From the provided details, it seems the simplification machinery in SymPy might be missing rules for certain trigonometric identities when the arguments are rational numbers. The identity `cos(x - y) = cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)` should be applicable here, but isn't being applied during simplification for rational arguments.

This can be traced back to how SymPyâ€™s `simplify` function works. The current implementation may not be recognizing the specific patterns for rational arguments within trigonometric functions, thereby missing the opportunity to apply these identities.

**Proposed Changes**: Modify the internal simplification rules in the relevant file to include handling for trigonometric simplifications involving rational numbers. 

1. **File**: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`
   - **Function**: `simplify` or relevant helper function used within `simplify`.
   - **Change**: Include logic to detect when the arguments to `sin` and `cos` are rational and apply appropriate trigonometric identities.

   Detailed changes:
   - Extend the pattern-matching logic to detect rational arguments inside trigonometric functions.
   - Introduce specific cases where trigonometric identities are applied for simplification directly when arguments are rational.
   - Ensure that these changes do not interfere with the simplification logic for symbolic arguments.

2. **Example Change**:
   - In the `simplify` logic, detect expressions of the form `sin(a/b)*sin(c/d) + cos(a/b)*cos(c/d)` and transform them using the identity `cos(a/b - c/d)`.
   - Similarly, other useful trigonometric transformations can be included, ensuring rational handling is robust.

3. **Additional Considerations**:
   - Ensure that other parts of simplification that might involve rational numbers are also checked for consistency.
   - Add relevant checks to prevent any regression in symbolic simplification.

By making these changes in the simplification logic, the expression involving rational arguments within `sin` and `cos` will be simplified as expected, improving the overall capability of SymPy's simplification engine.
