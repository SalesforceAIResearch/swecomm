**Title**: Fix Rational Argument Simplification in Trigonometric Functions

**Problem**:
The user's code demonstrates that symbolic expressions involving sine and cosine functions of Rational arguments are not being simplified as expected in SymPy. When trigonometric functions such as `sin` and `cos` are called with Rational inputs, they should simplify using standard trigonometric identities, e.g., `cos(a + b) = cos(a)cos(b) - sin(a)sin(b)`, but they currently do not.

**Analysis**:
Upon review of the sympy codebase, particularly the trigonometric simplification functionality and the `handlers/sets.py` file, it seems that the `simplify` method does not handle rational values in the case of trigonometric functions effectively. Possible reasons for this issue include:
1. The simplification process does not recognize that rational multiples of π (pi) have well-known trigonometric values.
2. The `ask` function in `handlers/sets.py` does not consider rational arguments when deciding if a trigonometric simplification should be applied.

Trigonometric simplification should handle rational multiples of π using known properties and identities (e.g., `cos(π/4) = sqrt(2)/2`). The key is to enhance the simplification logic in the sections of code that handle trigonometric functions.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File `sympy/assumptions/handlers/sets.py`**:
   - Update the logic inside the static methods `sin`, `cos`, and other trigonometric function handlers to recognize when the argument is a Rational multiple of π.

2. **File `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`**:
   - Enhance the simplification logic to check for Rational inputs and apply trigonometric identities accordingly.
   
Here is a detailed plan of proposed changes:

1. **File**: `sympy/assumptions/handlers/sets.py`
   - Update the `sin` and `cos` static handlers to recognize rational multiples of π and apply known trigonometric identities to simplify the expressions.

   

   Change Logic:
   

2. **File**: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`
   - Add logic to the main `simplify` function to recognize and simplify expressions involving trigonometric functions with rational arguments.

   

By implementing these changes, the simplification of trigonometric expressions involving rational values should behave as expected, providing the user with accurate and simplified results.
