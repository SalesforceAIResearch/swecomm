**Title**: Handle ZeroDivisionError in _sparse_fit for SVM when support_vectors_ is empty

**Problem**: A ZeroDivisionError occurs in the `_sparse_fit` method for Support Vector Machines (SVM) when the `support_vectors_` attribute is empty, particularly when fitting sparse data.

**Analysis**: 
This issue arises because the fit method for the sparse data does not account for the case where `support_vectors_` could be empty, which results in a division by zero error when calculating `dual_coef_indices.size / n_class`. To resolve this, we need to ensure that the size of support vectors and dual coefficients is checked and handled gracefully if they are zero.

When `support_vectors_` is empty, it implies that no support vectors were found during the fitting process. This scenario should properly set `self.dual_coef_` to an empty sparse matrix and skip further processing that depends on non-zero support vectors.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Modify the relevant SVM handling functions in the file:

**File to Modify**: `sklearn/svm/base.py`

1. **Method `_sparse_fit`**:
    - Before any calculations that depend on `support_vectors_`, add a check to see if it is empty.
    - If `support_vectors_` is empty, set `self.dual_coef_` to an empty sparse matrix using `sp.csr_matrix()` and gracefully exit the function or skip the related processing.

**Detailed Modifications**:
1. In the `sklearn/svm/base.py` file, locate the `_sparse_fit` method.
2. Add a conditional check before any operations that assume non-zero support vectors:
    
3. Ensure this condition is placed strategically to prevent any divisions or operations that would result in errors because of zero-sized arrays.

By making these changes, the code will handle cases where there are no support vectors without throwing a ZeroDivisionError, ensuring robustness and correctness when dealing with sparse data.
