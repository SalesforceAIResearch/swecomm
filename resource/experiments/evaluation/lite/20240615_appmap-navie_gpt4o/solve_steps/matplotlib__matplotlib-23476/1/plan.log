**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

[Bug]: DPI of a figure is doubled after unpickling on M1 Mac
### Bug summary

When a figure is unpickled, it's dpi is doubled. This behaviour happens every time and if done in a loop it can cause an `OverflowError`.

### Code for reproduction

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pickle
import platform

print(matplotlib.get_backend())
print('Matplotlib ver:', matplotlib.__version__)
print('Platform:', platform.platform())
print('System:', platform.system())
print('Release:', platform.release())
print('Python ver:', platform.python_version())


def dump_load_get_dpi(fig):
    with open('sinus.pickle','wb') as file:
        pickle.dump(fig, file)

    with open('sinus.pickle', 'rb') as blob:
        fig2 = pickle.load(blo... (3141)
