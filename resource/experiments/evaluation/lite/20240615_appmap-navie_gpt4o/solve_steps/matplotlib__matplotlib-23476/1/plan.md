**Title**: Correct DPI Doubling Issue after Unpickling on M1 Mac

**Problem**: 
When unpickling a Matplotlib figure on an M1 Mac, the DPI value is doubled each time, leading to an `OverflowError` eventually.

**Analysis**:
The issue likely stems from a problem in how the DPI setting of the figure is restored after unpickling. Specifically, the DPI value might be inadvertently multiplied when the figure is re-constructed. On M1 Macs, this doubling occurs due to some hardware-specific handling of DPI settings.

Through examining the provided code and the relevant Matplotlib backends, the function responsible for handling such behavior is likely the `FigureCanvasMac` class in `backend_macosx.py`, which interacts with DPI settings during figure rendering and unpickling.

**Proposed Changes**:
To address the DPI doubling on M1 Macs, we need to ensure that the DPI value is accurately preserved when re-constructing the figure from the pickle file. This involves modifying how the DPI value is set during unpickling.

### Steps:
1. **Modify the DPI setting handling in the `FigureCanvasMac` initialization:**
   - Identify the areas where DPI is set in the `FigureCanvasMac` class.
   - Ensure DPI is correctly initialized and not incremented or multiplied during the unpickle process.

### Modification Location and Details:
**File**: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_macosx.py`

1. **Check the `FigureCanvasMac` Constructor**:
   The DPI value should be set only if it has not been already initialized or if specific conditions require it. Add a check to prevent doubling the DPI.

**Modification Details**:

- **Identify the initialization code where DPI is set**:
   - Look for lines in `FigureCanvasMac.__init__` where DPI is being set, particularly in the interplay with the figure attributes.

- **Add a condition to prevent changing DPI if it's already set**:
   - Update the constructor and any method that sets the DPI to include a check to ensure the DPI value is not inadvertently doubled.

   
- **Ensure DPI is maintained correctly during unpickling process**:
   - Any relevant code participating in the unpickling should honor the initialized DPI value and avoid recalculating or adjusting it.

By adding these checks and conditions, the DPI doubling issue specifically observed on M1 Macs should be resolved, ensuring consistent DPI values after unpickling and preventing the overflow error.
