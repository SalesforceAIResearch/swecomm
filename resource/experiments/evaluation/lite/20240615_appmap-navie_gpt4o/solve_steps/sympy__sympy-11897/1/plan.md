**Title**: Harmonize LaTeX Printer Output with Pretty Printer

**Problem**: The LaTeX printer is giving inconsistent output compared to the pretty printer for some mathematical expressions. The output from both printers should be consistent unless LaTeX offers a more optimized output.

**Analysis**: The discrepancy between the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer arises from how each printer handles particular mathematical expressions. For instance, multiplication and division operations display differently. The LaTeX printer currently does not factor in certain nuances that the pretty printer considers, such as differentiations in multiplication and division representations.

Two specific examples demonstrating inconsistency are:

1. `latex(exp(-x)*log(x))` outputs `\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\log{\\left (x \\right )}` while `pprint(exp(-x)*log(x))` correctly displays a more intuitive representation.
2. `latex(1/(x + y)/2)` outputs `\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}` while `pprint(1/(x + y)/2)` reveals `\frac{1}{2⋅(x + y)}`.

To resolve these inconsistencies, alterations are required in the LaTeX printer's methods to ensure they align better with the pretty printer’s results.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sympy/printing/latex.py`
   
   - **Function**: `_print_Mul`
     - Ensure multiplication and division operations are handled consistently with pretty printer logic.
     - Modify the function to adjust its handling of nested divisions and products, ensuring they are represented similarly to the pretty printer.
   
   - **Function**: `_print_Pow`
     - Modify to handle negative exponents better and to ensure the output matches the pretty printer’s handling of similar expressions.

2. **File**: `sympy/printing/pretty.py`
   
   - **Function**: `_print_Mul`
     - Ensure this function consistently represents multiplications and divisions to provide a clear and intuitive output that the LaTeX printer can imitate.
   
   - **Function**: `_print_Pow`
     - Modify to help standardize representation, particularly focusing on improving readability which the LaTeX printer can replicate.

3. **File**: `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`
   
   - **Function**: `parenthesize`
     - This may need modifications to ensure it correctly uses parentheses for all expressions, aligning with the logic in the pretty printer.

4. **File**: `sympy/printing/conventions.py`
   
   - **Function**: `split_super_sub`
     - Ensure this handles the super and sub scripts in a standardized manner so that both pretty and LaTeX printers output consistently.

The exact logic should include:
- Verifying how expressions are expanded and when to use parentheses.
- Ensuring linear terms in denominators, products of constants, and negative exponents are treated the same in both representations.
- Evaluating intermediate forms and ensuring both printers use similar transformation strategies for these forms before final output.

By focusing on these core functions, the LaTeX printer's output can be harmonized to match the intuitive representations provided by the pretty printer, achieving consistency and clarity in mathematical expression outputs across both formats.
