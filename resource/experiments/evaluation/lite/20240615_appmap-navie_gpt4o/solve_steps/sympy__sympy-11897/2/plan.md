**Title**: Ensure LaTeX Printer Output Consistency with Pretty Printer

**Problem**: The LaTeX printer currently produces different output from the pretty printer in some cases. Specifically, the LaTeX printer simplifies expressions differently compared to the pretty printer.

**Analysis**: To ensure that the LaTeX printer is consistent with the pretty printer, we must identify where the discrepancies occur in the `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` file, which is responsible for handling the LaTeX and pretty printing of various mathematical expressions, including functions and derivatives.

Given the provided examples, it seems the main issue arises from the way fractions and products are printed. The LaTeX printer simplifies the expression `1/(2*(x + y))` to `1/(2x + 2y)`, which is inconsistent with the pretty printer’s output `1/(2*(x + y))`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Modify `_print_Division` in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`**: Adjust the `_print_Division` method of the LaTeX printer to ensure that it represents fractions and products in a way that is consistent with the pretty printer.
    - Ensure that fractional expressions maintain the parentheses around sums in the denominator unless there's a better simplification that can be achieved through LaTeX.

2. **Adjust `_print_Function` Method**: Review and adjust the `_print_Function` method to make sure functions such as exponentials are printed consistently.
    - Specifically focus on how exponential and logarithmic functions are represented to ensure consistency.

3. **Add Tests for Consistency**: While not part of the direct code changes, ensure to run existing tests and possibly add new ones to confirm that changes do not introduce new inconsistencies.

Here’s a description of the necessary changes for the `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` file:

**File**: `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`

1. **Adjust `_print_Division`**:
    - Modify the method to ensure fractions are printed with parentheses when needed, aligning the behavior with the pretty printer.

2. **Adjust `_print_Function`**:
    - Ensure that functions such as exponentials (`exp(-x)`) and logarithms (`log(x)`) are handled properly without implicitly simplifying parts of the expression.
  - Maintain the original form output by the pretty printer unless a specific LaTeX formatting improves readability without altering the mathematical meaning.

By implementing these changes, the LaTeX printer's output will align more closely with the pretty printer’s output, ensuring consistency across different formats of mathematical expression rendering.
