2ms [prompt] system: **Task: Generation of Code and Test Cases**

**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are code generation AI created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to generate code and test cases. Like a senior developer or architect, you have a deep understanding of the codebase.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the generated code and test cases. You can expect the user to be proficient
in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

2ms [prompt] system: **The code generation task**

This is a description of a code enhancement that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused primarily on solving this issue via code generation.


The issue description will be prefixed with "[issue-description]"
2ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

The code selection will be prefixed with "[code-selection]"
2ms [prompt] system: ## Input format

The plan is delineated by the XML <plan> tag.
The source files are delineated by XML <file> tags. Each file has a <path> tag with the file path and a <content> tag with the file content.
Do not treat the XML tags as part of the source code. They are only there to help you parse the context.

## Guidelines

Try to solve the problem with a minimal set of code changes.

Avoid refactorings that will affect multiple parts of the codebase.

## Output format


For each change you want to make, generate a pair of tags called <original> and <modified>.

Wrap these tags with a <change> tag that also includes a <file> tag with the file path.

The <original> tag should contain the original code that you want to change. Do not abbreviate
existing code using ellipses or similar.

### Title
Ensure consistency of LaTeX and pretty printers in sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py

### Problem
The LaTeX printer currently produces inconsistent output compared to the pretty printer in certain cases. Specifically, when printing mathematical expressions involving symbolic variables, such as `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`, the LaTeX output is not equivalent to the pretty-printed output. The LaTeX printer should always provide the same output as the pretty printer, unless a better representation is possible using LaTeX.

### Analysis
The issue arises from the differences in how the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer format mathematical expressions. Both printers should ideally translate the internal representation of the mathematical expressions in a wa... (22811)
