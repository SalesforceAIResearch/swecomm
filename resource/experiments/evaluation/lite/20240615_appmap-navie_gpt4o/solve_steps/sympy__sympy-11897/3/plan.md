### Title
Ensure consistency of LaTeX and pretty printers in sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py

### Problem
The LaTeX printer currently produces inconsistent output compared to the pretty printer in certain cases. Specifically, when printing mathematical expressions involving symbolic variables, such as `exp(-x)*log(x)` and `1/(x + y)/2`, the LaTeX output is not equivalent to the pretty-printed output. The LaTeX printer should always provide the same output as the pretty printer, unless a better representation is possible using LaTeX.

### Analysis
The issue arises from the differences in how the LaTeX printer and the pretty printer format mathematical expressions. Both printers should ideally translate the internal representation of the mathematical expressions in a way that reflects the same logical structure and visual representation. 

In the provided examples:
- `latex(exp(-x)*log(x))` yields `\\frac{1}{e^{x}} \\log{\\left (x \\right )}`, whereas `pprint(exp(-x)*log(x))` yields `ℯ  ⋅log(x)`.
- `latex(1/(x + y)/2)` yields `\\frac{1}{2 x + 2 y}`, whereas `pprint(1/(x + y)/2)` yields `\n 1\n─────────\n2⋅(x + y)`.

The root cause is in the LaTeX formatting logic, which simplifies or modifies expressions differently than the pretty printer. The goal is to modify the LaTeX printer behavior to align its outputs more closely with those of the pretty printer.

### Proposed Changes
Given that the issue specifically focuses on the consistency of LaTeX printing for certain expressions, we'll identify and modify the LaTeX printer functions in `sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py` to ensure that they produce output consistent with the pretty printer.

1. **File: sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py**
    - **Function:** `_latex` in relevant classes.
    - **Modification:** 
        - Adjust the `_latex` function implementations to ensure that the expressions are formatted similarly to their pretty printer counterparts. Specifically, ensure that fractions, products, and logarithms are represented as they are in the pretty printer.
        - Ensure any specific transformations or simplifications applied in the LaTeX printer align with those in the pretty printer, unless a clearer representation can be achieved through LaTeX.

Here is a description of the changes:

#### sympy/physics/quantum/hilbert.py
- **In function `_latex` of relevant classes (lines 536-547):**
  - Ensure that logarithmic and exponential expressions conform to the same structure as their pretty-printed forms.
  - For instance, use `\mathrm{exp}` for exponential functions and align fraction representation to avoid unnecessary simplifications that are inconsistent with pretty printer outputs.

- **Example Changes:**
  - **Adjust LaTeX string formatting to avoid fraction simplification:** Use parenthesis and `\left`, `\right` properly to ensure the same visual grouping of terms.
  - **Ensure Consistency with Pretty Printer:** Make sure that the same logical grouping of operands and operators is maintained.

By making these adjustments, we can ensure the LaTeX printer yields consistent and expected output similar to the pretty printer, resolving the discrepancies noted in the problem statement.
