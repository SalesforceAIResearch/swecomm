**Title**: Generate man page section directories for Sphinx ManualPageBuilder

**Problem**: 
The current man page generation does not conform to the `MANPATH` search functionality. All generated man pages are placed in a single-level directory `<build-dir>/man`. This structure is incompatible with the `man` program, which expects man pages to be organized in section directories (e.g., `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.).

**Analysis**: 
To fix this issue, we need to adjust the `ManualPageBuilder` class to create and use the correct section directories for man pages. Each man page should be placed in a directory corresponding to its section, specified as part of the man page metadata (typically the fifth element of the `man_pages` configuration value).

The following components of the `ManualPageBuilder` class and related functions in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` need to be modified:
1. Initialize the section-wise target directories.
2. Modify the `get_outfilename` method to return the correct path including the section directory.
3. Ensure that directories are created if they do not already exist.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Update `ManualPageBuilder` Class Initialization (sphinx/builders/manpage.py)**:
   - Modify the `init` method to create the necessary section directories if they do not exist. Ensure that `self.outdir` is the main output directory.

2. **Modify `get_outfilename` Method (sphinx/builders/manpage.py)**:
   - Update `get_outfilename` to incorporate the section directory in the returned path.

3. **Update `write` Method (sphinx/builders/manpage.py)**:
   - Ensure man pages are written to the new sectioned directory structure. 

Details:

- **ManualPageBuilder Class (sphinx/builders/manpage.py)**:
  - In the `init` method, add logic to create directories for each man page section (man1, man3, etc.).
  - Modify the `get_outfilename` method to determine the correct output directory based on the section of the man page.



- **Write Method Update**:
  - In the write method, ensure files are written to the correct directory using the updated `get_outfilename`.



By following these modifications, we ensure that Sphinx generated man pages are organized in a structure compatible with the `MANPATH` environment variable, improving portability and adherence to Unix standards.
