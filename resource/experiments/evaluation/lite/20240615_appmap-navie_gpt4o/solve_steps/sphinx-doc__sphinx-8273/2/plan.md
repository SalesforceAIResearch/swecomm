**Title**: Organize Generated Man Pages into Section Directories

**Problem**

Currently, the man page generation places all man pages into a single-level directory `<build-dir>/man`, which does not conform to the `MANPATH` search functionality. The `man` program looks for man pages in section directories (like `man/man1`, `man/man3`, etc.). This means the generated man pages can't be directly used with the `MANPATH` environment variable and requires additional setup in the build system to work properly.

**Analysis**

The root cause of the issue is that the current implementation does not segment the man pages into section-specific directories, which is required for proper use with the `MANPATH` environment variable. 

To fix this:
1. Identify the section of the man page (which is already specified in the `default_man_pages` function).
2. Modify the file output paths to include the section directories, such as `man/man1/`, `man/man3/`, etc.
3. Ensure that the build process correctly creates these directories if they do not exist and places the man pages in the appropriate section directories.

This approach should maintain backward compatibility while addressing the requirement to segregate man pages into proper sections.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **Modify `default_man_pages` function in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`:**
   - Update the return structure or modify the handling to include the section information.

2. **Update `ManualPageBuilder` class in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`:**
   - In the `write` method, modify the output path to include the section directory.
   - Ensure directories for sections are created if they do not exist.

Here's a detailed description of the changes required:

1. **sphinx/builders/manpage.py**

    - **Function: `default_man_pages(config: Config) -> List[Tuple[str, str, str, List[str], int]]`:**
        - No changes required here specifically, but ensure the section number is correctly utilized downstream.

    - **Class: `ManualPageBuilder`**
        - **Method: `write(self, *ignored: Any) -> None`**
            - Modify the output path to include the section number.
            
            Before writing each man page, ensure the path includes the section subdirectory (`man1`, `man3`, etc.). This involves:
            - Extracting the section number from the `self.config.man_pages` list.
            - Constructing the output directory path to include the section directory (e.g., `path.join(self.outdir, 'man', f'man{section}')`).
            - Ensuring this directory is created if it doesn't already exist.
            - Writing the man page to this directory.
            
            Ensure these changes are made before the following snippet:
            

2. **Other lines to check in `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`:**
    - Ensure related methods such as `get_target_uri` and directory handling in `init` align with this new directory structure.

These changes will ensure that the man pages are generated in a way that can be directly used with the `MANPATH` environment variable, providing a more intuitive and functional output for downstream users.
