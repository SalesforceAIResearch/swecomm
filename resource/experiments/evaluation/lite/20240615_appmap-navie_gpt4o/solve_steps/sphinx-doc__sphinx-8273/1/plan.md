**Title:** Generate Sectioned Directories for Man Pages to Conform with MANPATH

**Problem:**
Currently, the Sphinx documentation generator places all generated man pages in a single directory (`<build-dir>/man`). This structure does not comply with the Unix `MANPATH` environment variable, which expects man pages to be located in section-specific directories (e.g., `man1/`, `man3/`). As a result, the Unix `man` program cannot properly locate the man pages.

**Analysis:**
To address this issue, we need to ensure that man pages are generated within appropriate section directories based on the section specified in their filename. For example:
- Files in section 1 should be placed in `<build-dir>/man/man1/`
- Files in section 3 should be placed in `<build-dir>/man/man3/`

By modifying the Sphinx builder responsible for generating man pages, we can ensure the correct directory structure is maintained.

**Proposed Changes:**
The file `sphinx/builders/manpage.py` should be modified to create appropriate section directories and place the generated man pages accordingly.

1. **Modify the `ManPageBuilder` Class:**
   - Update the `get_outfilename` method to return a path that includes the appropriate section directory.
   
2. **Adjust File Saving Logic:**
   - Ensure that the builder creates necessary directories if they donâ€™t already exist.

Detailed changes in the file `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`:

1. **Update the `get_outfilename` Method:**
   - Parse the section from the man page filename.
   - Construct the output path using the section directory.

2. **Ensure Directory Creation:**
   - Before writing to the file, check if the directory exists and create it if necessary.

### Detailed Description of Changes:

**File:** `sphinx/builders/manpage.py`

1. **Modify `get_outfilename`:**
   - Update logic to handle section parsing and include it in the output directory path.

2. **Check and Create Section Directory:**
   - Before saving the man page file, ensure the correct section directory exists.

**Summary of Necessary Changes:**

- **Locate the `ManPageBuilder` class.**
- **Modify the `get_outfilename` method**:
  - Parse the section number from the man page file name (usually suffixed with `.<section>`).
  - Construct the output file path to include the section directory (`man1`, `man3`, etc.).
  
- **Ensure directory creation**:
  - Before writing to the file, check if the output directory exists.
  - If not, create it to ensure the man page is stored in the correct section directory.
