**Title**: Fix input validation regression for `mutual_info_score` in handling object dtype arrays.

**Problem**: 
Currently, there is an issue with the `mutual_info_score` function where it raises a `ValueError` when handling arrays of object dtype with ufunc comparisons. It affects cases where elements are object types (e.g., strings), whereas it worked without issues in version 0.21.1.

**Analysis**:
This regression was introduced between versions 0.21.1 and the current version. The problem likely lies in the way input validation and type casting are being handled. Specifically, operations expecting numerical types are now encountering issues when provided with object arrays that contain non-numeric data.

The discrepancy between `np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20)` and `np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)` suggests the issue could be the automatic type casting or handling during the entropy calculations or contingency matrix construction within the module.

**Proposed Changes**:
Suggested changes will be in the `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` file.

1. **_check_object_dtype_and_convert**:
   Define a helper function to safely handle object dtype arrays by converting them during computations without affecting the original input.

2. **Update mutual_info_score**:
   Modify the `mutual_info_score` function to use the helper function to ensure object dtype arrays are processed correctly.

3. **Update contingency_matrix**:
   Ensure that `contingency_matrix` handles object dtype arrays appropriately.

Changes to `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py`:

1. **Create a helper function** `._check_object_dtype_and_convert`:
   - Inside `_supervised.py` file, define a function to convert object dtype arrays to a form that can be handled without errors (e.g., encoding string objects to integers for the calculation duration).

2. **Update `mutual_info_score`**:
   - Call the helper function `_check_object_dtype_and_convert` before performing mutual information calculations to ensure inputs are handled correctly.

3. **Update `contingency_matrix`** within the same file:
   - Ensure internal handling within `contingency_matrix` also adheres to proper dtype checking and conversion if necessary.

By focusing on these areas, we can ensure that object arrays are managed correctly without errors, thus regaining the behavior from version 0.21.1.

Make sure to test the changes thoroughly to avoid any unintended side effects. Remember not to alter any test files directly; instead, add or update test cases within the existing testing framework to validate these modifications.
