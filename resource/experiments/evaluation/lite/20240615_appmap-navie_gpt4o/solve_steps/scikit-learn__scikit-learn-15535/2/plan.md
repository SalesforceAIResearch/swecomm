**Title**: Fix input validation regression in clustering metrics for array with object dtype

**Problem**: The regression in the input validation of clustering metrics is causing a `ValueError` when using `mutual_info_score` with an array of object dtype. Previously, in version 0.21.1, this scenario did not raise an error, and the function worked without any warnings when using object arrays with string values.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue is that the current implementation fails to handle arrays of object dtype properly when calculating clustering metrics. Specifically, the function tries to convert the input labels to floats, which is not suitable for non-numeric object types like strings.

**Proposed Changes**: To resolve this issue, we need to modify the input validation logic to correctly handle arrays with object dtype. The changes will involve ensuring that no conversion to float occurs for object arrays and that they are processed correctly, without causing a `ValueError`.

### Target File: sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py

1. **Update `mutual_info_score` function**:
    - Check the dtype of the input arrays `labels_true` and `labels_pred`.
    - Ensure the function can handle object dtype arrays without attempting to cast them to float.

Modify the location:

- `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py`:
  - Function: `mutual_info_score`
  - Line range (around line 738-756):

Detailed changes:
- Ensure the `contingency_matrix` function correctly processes object dtype arrays and handle them without conversion to floats.
- Add conditionals to check for object dtype and skip any irrelevant dtype conversions.

### Steps:
1. **Introduce dtype checks before critical operations**:
    - Check if the type of input arrays is `object`.
    - If true, handle these arrays appropriately without converting to float.

2. **Modify calculations and conversions**:
    - Skip or modify calculations requiring float conversion to effectively handle object arrays.
    - Ensure `contingency`, `contingency.astype`, and related functions correctly process object types.

This will prevent the `ValueError` and ensure that the function works as expected, maintaining backward compatibility with the behavior in version 0.21.1.

Implement these changes minimally to ensure the regression is fixed without extensive modifications to other parts of the codebase. This targeted approach maintains the integrity of the existing implementation while resolving the bug.
