**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Solve the problem as if you... (2655)
1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**
This is a description of the problem that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused ond describing the problem fully as a software Issue, aka Ticket.


The problem statement will be prefixed with "[problem-statement]"
2ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

The code selection will be prefixed with "[code-selection]"
2ms [prompt] system: 
Focus the plan on modifying exactly one file.

Do not modify test case files. Test case files are those that include "test", "tests" in their paths,
or match the patterns "*_test.py" or "test_*.py".

DO choose the one most relevant file to modify.
DO NOT modify any other files.
DO NOT choose a test case file.

labels : array, shape = [n_samples]
         Predicted labels for each sample.

    metric : string, or callable
        The metric to use when calculating distance between instances in a
        feature array. If metric is a string, it must be one of the options
        allowed by :func:`metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances
        <sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances>`. If X is the distance
        array itself, use ``metric="precomputed"``.

    sample_size : int or None
        The size of the sample to use when computing the Silhouette Coefficient
        on a random subset of the data.
        If ``sample_size is None``, no sampling is used.

regression in input validation of clustering metrics
```python
from sklearn.metrics.cluster import mutual_info_score
import numpy as np

x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20).astype(object)
mutual_info_score(x, x)
```
ValueError: could not convert string to float: 'b'

while
```python
x = np.random.choice(['a', 'b'], size=20)
mutual_info_score(x, x)
```
works with a warning?

this worked in 0.21.1 without a warning (as I think it should)


Edit by @ogrisel: I removed the `.astype(object)` in the second code snippet.
