Symbol instances have __dict__ since 1.7?
In version 1.6.2 Symbol instances had no `__dict__` attribute
```python
>>> sympy.Symbol('s').__dict__
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
AttributeError                            Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-3-e2060d5eec73> in <module>
----> 1 sympy.Symbol('s').__dict__

AttributeError: 'Symbol' object has no attribute '__dict__'
>>> sympy.Symbol('s').__slots__
('name',)
```

This changes in 1.7 where `sympy.Symbol('s').__dict__` now exists (and returns an empty dict)
I may misinterpret this, but given the purpose of `__slots__`, I assume this is a bug, introduced because some parent class accidentally stopped defining `__slots__`.

</issue>
