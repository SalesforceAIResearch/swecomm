**Title**: Reintroduce `__slots__` in the `Symbol` class to prevent the `__dict__` attribute

**Problem**:
In SymPy version 1.6.2, `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute due to the use of `__slots__`. However, since version 1.7, `sympy.Symbol('s').__dict__` exists and returns an empty dictionary. This could be due to an inadvertent change where a parent class stopped defining `__slots__`.

**Analysis**:
The `__slots__` mechanism in Python is used to prevent the per-instance `__dict__` and thus save memory. This change suggests that `__slots__` might have been introduced in the `Symbol` class or one of its parent classes but was later removed or overridden, leading to the presence of the `__dict__` attribute.

To restore the original behavior, we need to reintroduce `__slots__` in the `Symbol` class, ensuring that the `__dict__` attribute is not present. We should verify the class hierarchy and ensure no intermediary class reintroduces `__dict__`.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **sympy/core/symbol.py**: Modify the `Symbol` class to reintroduce `__slots__`.

   - Locate the `Symbol` class implementation.
   - Add the `__slots__` attribute to the `Symbol` class to define only the required instance attributes and prevent the creation of the `__dict__`.

Detailed changes:

- In the `sympy/core/symbol.py` file, ensure the `Symbol` class has the `__slots__` attribute defined with necessary slots, such as `"name"`.
- If there are any classes in the inheritance chain of `Symbol` that should also use `__slots__`, modify those classes accordingly to prevent the creation of `__dict__`.

By ensuring all intermediary classes and the `Symbol` class define and use `__slots__`, we can restore the original behavior where `Symbol` instances do not have `__dict__` attributes.

These changes will prevent unwanted attributes and maintain memory efficiency for `Symbol` instances.
