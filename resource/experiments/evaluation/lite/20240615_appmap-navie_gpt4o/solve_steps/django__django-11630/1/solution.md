Based on the issue description, we need to incorporate the database name into the table introspection logic. Here's how you can modify the `table_names` and `get_table_list` methods in `django/db/backends/base/introspection.py` to include the database name as part of the table's identification:

With these changes, the `table_names` method now incorporates the database name as a prefix to each table name. This ensures that tables from different databases will have unique identifications, even if they share the same name. Additionally, the `get_table_list` method is updated to include this new format for table identifiers.

Please, implement these changes and proceed to test if they resolve the conflicts in your project when dealing with multiple databases. If there are any other similar methods interacting with table names, they may also need to be updated accordingly.
