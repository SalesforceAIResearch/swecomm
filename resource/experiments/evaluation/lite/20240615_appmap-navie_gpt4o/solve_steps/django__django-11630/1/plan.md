### Title
Modify Django Table Introspection to Allow Duplicate Table Names Across Different Databases

### Problem
When running multiple Django apps that each connect to their own databases, an error is thrown if two different models, in separate apps, share the same table name. The error specifically calls out that the `db_table` is used by multiple models in different apps, even if they are in separate databases. This is a new behavior observed after upgrading to Django 2.2 from Django 2.0.

Error message:


### Analysis
This issue arises because of the way Django's introspection utilities handle table names. When Django performs checks on table names during migrations or schema operations, it does not differentiate between separate databases, causing a conflict if two models, even in separate databases, share the same table name. 

The error message indicates that Django does not expect more than one model to share a `db_table` name across different applications. This behavior most likely stems from the introspection code that gathers all table names and checks for uniqueness.

To resolve this issue, the introspection logic needs to be adjusted to account for unique databases. Specifically, the methods responsible for collecting table names should include database-specific checks or namespaces.

### Proposed Changes
**File to Modify: `django/db/backends/base/introspection.py`**

1. **Modify `table_names` Method:**
   - Update the `table_names` method to include the database name as part of the identification process to avoid conflicts from different databases.
   - Ensure that the collected table names are segregated based on their database.

2. **Adjust `get_table_list` Method:**
   - Implement a check or a namespace that includes the database to differentiate between tables from different databases.
   - Update the method to handle scenarios where multiple databases could have tables with the same name.

### Detailed Proposed Changes
**File to Modify: `django/db/backends/base/introspection.py`**
1. **Modification in the `table_names` Method:**
   - Update to differentiate table names by database to prevent conflicts.

**Before:**
In the current mechanism, the `table_names` method operates without considering the database context, leading to conflicts.

**After:**
Update the method to incorporate the database name in the unique identifier for tables.

2. **Add/Update Methods in `BaseDatabaseIntrospection`:**
   - Implement additional logic in any other relevant methods to incorporate database-specific table checks.

For example, modifying the `get_table_list` method, if needed, to ensure tables are collected distinctly per database context.

### Example of Changes:
Make sure to handle uniqueness of tables within the same database while allowing them to be the same in different databases.
- Change the logic in methods that enumerate tables to use a combination of `database_name.table_name` as the identifier where needed.
- Ensure that the `get_table_list` implementation allows for differentiated namespaces based on the database context.

By implementing these changes, Django will be able to distinguish tables based on the database they are in, thus resolving the conflict where different apps have models sharing the same table name across different databases. This will restore the functionality previously observed in Django 2.0 and align it with the new version's constraints.
