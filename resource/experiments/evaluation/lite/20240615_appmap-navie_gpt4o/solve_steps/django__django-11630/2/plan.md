**Title**: Modify `django_table_names` to Handle Duplicate Table Names Across Different Apps

**Problem**:
The user is encountering an error in Django 2.2 when different applications have models with the same table names. The error message generated is:

In previous versions of Django (pre-2.2), this setup was allowed, but after the upgrade to Django 2.2, it results in a configuration error.

**Analysis**:
Upon reviewing the code, it's apparent that Django performs a validation check to ensure unique table names across the entire project, which conflicts with the user's setup of having multiple apps with the same table names but different databases.

The root of the problem lies in the `django_table_names` method within `django/db/backends/base/introspection.py`. This method gathers table names from models in the `INSTALLED_APPS` and doesn't account for the scenario where different apps may have models that reference the same table names in different databases.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the table name gathering logic differentiates between these apps, possibly by appending the app label to the table name (to keep them distinct) or by making the method aware of different database configurations.

**Proposed Changes**:

_File: django/db/backends/base/introspection.py_

1. **Modify `django_table_names` Method:**
   - Adjust the `django_table_names` method to differentiate between tables coming from different databases. We can achieve this by incorporating the database alias into the key comparison or by prefixing table names with their respective app labels.

2. **Adjust Logic to Handle Database Aliases:**
   - Ensure that the logic includes database alias checks wherever necessary to differentiate between similar table names from different apps connecting to separate databases.

Modifications in `django_table_names` function:



Steps:
1. **Fetch Models with Database Alias:**
   Ensure that models are fetched considering their database alias.
   

2. **Prefix Table Names or Use Database Alias:**
   Modify table name processing to include the app label or database alias for distinction.
   

By making these changes, Django will distinguish tables across different apps correctly, avoiding conflict errors with duplicate table names across different applications.

Note: Keep in mind this change could have implications on other features that use the `django_table_names` method and might need testing across the wider codebase to ensure compatibility.
