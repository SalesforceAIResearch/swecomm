### Title:
Handle Multiple Apps with Same Table Name in Django 2.2

### Problem:
Django 2.2 throws an error when two different apps have models with the same table name but reside in different databases. The error states that `db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName`.

### Analysis:
In Django 2.2, stricter checks were introduced to ensure that the `db_table` attribute is unique across all models to avoid potential conflicts. This change was made to improve data consistency and integrity. However, your setup involves multiple databases where different apps can have their own tables with the same name, causing these checks to fail.

Given that Django's migration and introspection system are throwing these errors, the issue is likely happening when Django tries to introspect or perform operations on the models within these apps. The relevant logic appears to be intertwined with the state of the models and databases.

### Proposed Changes:
To address this issue, changes or overrides need to be made to the Django model state management and database introspection system such that Django correctly identifies models based on both their application and database configuration, rather than just the table name.

Focus the plan on modifying exactly one file.

1. **File: `django/db/migrations/state.py`**

    - **Function: `ProjectState.add_model`**
        - Modify the logic that adds the model to the project state to ensure that it considers both the `db_table` name and the app/model context when adding models.

    - **Function: `ProjectState.remove_model`**
        - Enhance the function to appropriately remove models based on both the `db_table` name and the app/model context.

    - **Function: `StateApps.register_model`**
        - When registering models, ensure the registration takes into account the specific database the model belongs to, thereby avoiding conflicts with other models in different databases.

2. **File: `django/db/migrations/state.py` - Ensure `render` and `clone` methods account for app and database separations.**

    - **Function: `ModelState.__init__`**
      - Modify this constructor if necessary to ensure fields or options specific to the model's database can be handled separately.

    - **Function: `_get_app_label_and_model_name`**
      - This utility function currently parses `model` and `app_label`. Ensure it is correctly parsing and storing unique configurations for models from different databases.

    - **Function: `render`**
      - During the creation of a model object, ensure that its registration respects the unique database and app contexts.

### Implementation Steps:

1. **Enhance Model Registration:**
    - Update the `register_model` function within `StateApps` to include database context when registering models to avoid collision of table names across different applications.

2. **Modify Model State Logic:**
    - Update the functions within the `ProjectState` class to ensure that models are added, removed, and managed based on both `db_table` and app/database context, preventing duplication errors.

3. **Ensure Correct Introspections:**
    - Ensure that Django introspection methods correctly handle multiple databases with potentially overlapping table names by factoring in the specific database configurations.

By making these changes, Django 2.2 should be able to recognize models with the same table name but managed by different applications within different databases, thus preventing the aforementioned conflict error.
