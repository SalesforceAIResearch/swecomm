Django throws error when different apps with different models have the same name table name.
Description
	
Error message:
table_name: (models.E028) db_table 'table_name' is used by multiple models: base.ModelName, app2.ModelName.
We have a Base app that points to a central database and that has its own tables. We then have multiple Apps that talk to their own databases. Some share the same table names.
We have used this setup for a while, but after upgrading to Django 2.2 we're getting an error saying we're not allowed 2 apps, with 2 different models to have the same table names. 
Is this correct behavior? We've had to roll back to Django 2.0 for now.
