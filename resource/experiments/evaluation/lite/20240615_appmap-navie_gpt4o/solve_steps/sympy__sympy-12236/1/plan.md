**Title**: Fix Wrong Result with `apart` Function in SymPy

**Problem**:
The `apart` function in the SymPy library is producing incorrect results for specific rational functions. When invoking `apart` on a symbolic expression, the expected partial fraction decomposition is not returned. 

**Analysis**:
The issue seems to stem from the handling of multivariate rational functions or specific cases within the partial fraction decomposition logic. Here are observations to support this:
1. Expressions like `bug.subs(a, 1).apart()` and `bug.subs(a, 1).apart(t)` are producing expected decompositions.
2. However, calling `apart` directly on the multivariate expression `bug` returns an incorrect result, specifically `-a*t` instead of the proper partial fraction decomposition.

The root cause likely resides in the `apart` functionâ€™s handling of multiple variables and the specific logic for separating coefficients and denominators involving other symbols.

**Proposed Changes**:
The changes should be focused on the `apart` function and its helper functions to ensure that they correctly handle the decomposition in cases involving multiple variables.

1. `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`, `apart` method:
   - Ensure the method properly handles the polynomial part and rational part separately for each symbol provided.
   - Update logic to properly identify and operate on the numerators and denominators when variables other than the main symbol are present.

2. `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`, `apart_undetermined_coeffs` and `apart_full_decomposition` methods:
   - These methods should be checked and adjusted to handle cases where nested products or sums of symbols appear.
   - Validate that the final results are correctly simplified and combined.

**Detailed Proposed Changes**:

1. In `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`:
   - **Function**: `apart`
     - Ensure that the function correctly checks for multivariate parts and recursively applies partial fraction decomposition on them.
     - Improve the selection of the main variable to decompose by prioritizing the variable passed as an argument or default to a heuristic method to determine the variable.

2. In `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`:
   - **Function**: `apart_undetermined_coeffs`
     - Ensure symbols are correctly collected and used in solving the partial fractions.
     - Add additional checks to prevent premature simplification or incorrect assumption about the variable dependencies.

3. In `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`:
   - **Function**: `apart_full_decomposition`
     - Improve handling of more complex rational functions, potentially reorganizing code sections to isolate and simplify each part of the decomposition.
     - Ensure `assemble_partfrac_list` correctly rebuilds the expression maintaining all symbolic relationships.

By addressing these functions, we can ensure the `apart` function behaves correctly in the presence of multiple variables or specific edge cases in terms of symbolic processing.

These proposed changes should ensure robust handling of partial fraction decomposition in SymPy, particularly for the multivariate cases observed.
