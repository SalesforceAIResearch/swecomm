**Title**: Fix Incorrect Result with `apart` Function in SymPy

**Problem**: The `apart` function in SymPy is returning incorrect partial fraction decompositions. Specifically, when applied to an expression involving a substitution, the output is incorrect for both general and specific cases.

**Analysis**: The `apart` function is intended to return the partial fraction decomposition of a given rational function. However, the issue arises when substitutions are made prior to decomposition, leading to inconsistent results. This indicates a problem with how the `apart` function handles substitutions and possibly with the method it uses for decomposition.

Upon analysis, it's evident that the method fails to correctly identify and handle certain structures within the rational function. Specifically, the decomposition should be more robust in handling complex expressions and perform the substitution correctly before applying the decomposition algorithm.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`
   - **Function**: `apart()`
     - Modify the function to ensure proper handling of substitutions before applying the partial fraction decomposition.
     - The issue seems to be in how it constructs the polynomial `P` and `Q`. Ensure `P` and `Q` are correctly simplified before proceeding with factorization and decomposition.
     
   - **Sub-function**: `apart_full_decomposition()`
     - Ensure that substitution operations are correctly reflected in the decomposition process.
     - Review the logic that processes the numerator and denominator separately and confirm they are properly integrated post-substitution.
     
   - **Function**: `apart_undetermined_coeffs(P, Q)`
     - Check the handling and construction of terms when the `apart` function is called on expressions involving parameters and ensure all edge cases are covered.
     
   - **Function**: `assemble_partfrac_list(partial_list)`
     - Ensure this function correctly reassembles the decomposed parts into a simplified and correct expression.
     - Properly address cases where the input has been substituted with specific values.

2. **Testing**:
   - Once the above changes are made, compile a series of tests reflecting the problematic input as indicated in the problem statement.
   - Ensure that substitutions are handled correctly and that the `apart` function produces consistent, mathematically correct results.

By targeting these specific areas within `apart`, the function should handle substitutions properly and yield correct decompositions, thereby fixing the underlying issue.
