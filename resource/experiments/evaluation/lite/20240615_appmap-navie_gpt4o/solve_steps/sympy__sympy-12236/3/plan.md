**Title: Correct Partial Fraction Decomposition for Multivariate Rational Functions in `apart`**

**Problem**:
The `apart` function in SymPy produces incorrect results when used on a multivariate rational function. Specifically, calling `apart(t)` on a bug expression returns `-a*t` instead of correctly performing partial fraction decomposition with respect to `t`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue lies in how `apart` handles multivariate rational functions. When `apart` is asked to decompose a rational function with multiple variables, it should ideally focus on the specified variable and treat other symbols correctly within the decomposition process. However, the current logic does not handle this correctly, leading to incomplete or incorrect partial fraction decomposition.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the function distinguishes between the variable of interest and other symbols, properly factorizes the polynomials, and applies partial fraction decomposition correctly.

**Proposed Changes**:

The `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` file is the most relevant file for the issue. Below are the critical changes required to correct the `apart` behavior:

1. **Check Multivariable Status Earlier**:
   Modify the logic to check whether the polynomial `P` is multivariate. If it is, the function should ideally handle it differently, ensuring the correct application of decomposition methods restricted to the specified variable.

2. **Update Multivariate Handling Logic**:
   In the section where errors are raised for multi-variable polynomials, include appropriate handling instead of directly raising `NotImplementedError`. This could involve preprocessing steps such as separating the components that involve `x` and applying partial fraction decomposition on those parts separately.

3. **Refactor Logic for Decomposition**:
   Enhance the logic within the decomposition steps to respect additional variables while performing the decomposition. Ensure that the decomposition algorithm respects the symmetries and properties of partial fractions beyond simple polynomial manipulation.

### Detailed Changes:

- **File: `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`**
    - **Line 80-107**:
        - Check if `P` is multivariate earlier.
        - Separate logic for multivariable polynomial pre-processing.
    - **Line 105-118**:
        - Ensure correct substitutions and cases for multivariable representations.
    - **Line 120-149**:
        - Factorize polynomials appropriately.
        - Split multivariable terms so the `apart` function handles them correctly.
    - **Line 150-188**:
        Refactor `apart_undetermined_coeffs` to better handle separate terms involving multiple variables.
    - **Line 354-389**:
        Refactor `apart_list_full_decomposition` to handle polynomial parts and rational parts with multivariate terms.
    - Add necessary conditions to align with multivariable inputs throughout the `apart` function, ensuring consistency.

By addressing these specific points, the `apart` function will correctly decompose multivariate rational functions, respecting the decomposition variable.

### Summary:
The proposed changes will enhance the robustness of the `apart` function in the `sympy/polys/partfrac.py` file, ensuring it correctly handles multivariate rational functions and returns accurate partial fraction decompositions when provided with specific variables.
