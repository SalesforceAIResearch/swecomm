### Title
Handle \p{Han} regex pattern in pylintrc without causing errors

### Problem
When configuring a regex pattern containing `\p{Han}` in the `.pylintrc` file, pylint throws an error due to unrecognized escape sequence `\p`.

### Analysis
The `\p{Han}` pattern is intended to match any character in the Unicode Han script (Chinese characters). However, the default Python `re` module does not support `\p` escapes, leading to the error "bad escape \p at position 1". The error occurs during the parsing of configuration file options where regex patterns are compiled using the `re` module.

To address this issue, the regex pattern should be processed and compiled using a library that supports Unicode property escapes, such as the `regex` module which is a drop-in replacement for the `re` module. The conversion should be applied before the existing configuration parsing logic.

### Proposed Changes
**File: `pylint/config/arguments_manager.py`**

1. **Modify** `_parse_configuration_file` method:
    - Add a preprocessing step to identify and handle Unicode property escapes in regex patterns before the existing parsing logic.
  
2. **Change** configuration parsing logic to use the `regex` module instead of the `re` module when Unicode properties are detected in the patterns.
  
Suggested steps:
- Check if any configuration string contains `\p{Han}`.
- Replace `re` module calls with `regex` module calls for regex patterns containing `\p{Han}` only.
- Ensure backward compatibility and minimal impact on existing functionality.

Detailed steps:
1. **Import** the `regex` module at the top of the file:
    

2. **Update** the `_parse_configuration_file` method:
    - Before existing parsing, add a preprocessing step to substitute escaped sequences in regex patterns:
      

3. **Update** any other configuration parsing methods that handle regular expressions, ensuring `regex` handling through the `regex` module instead of the `re` module where applicable.

This allows configurations with Unicode properties to be handled correctly by pylint without causing parsing errors, ensuring configurations intended to match Chinese characters (or other Unicode scripts) are parsed properly.
