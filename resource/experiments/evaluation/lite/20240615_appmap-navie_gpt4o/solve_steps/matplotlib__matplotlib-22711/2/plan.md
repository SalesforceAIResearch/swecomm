### Modify `set_val` Method to Properly Initialize Values for `RangeSlider`

**Problem**  
The `RangeSlider` widget in Matplotlib does not allow setting initial values, raising an "index out of bounds" error when an initial value (`valinit`) is specified. This is due to an erroneous line in the `set_val` method of the `RangeSlider` class.

**Analysis**  
The root cause of the issue is the assignment to `xy[4]`, which is not necessary and causes an "index out of bounds" error. The `xy` array has only four elements, which represent the vertices of the rectangle visualizing the slider range. The extra fifth index causes the array to go out of bounds. Commenting this line fixes the error without affecting the functionality.

**Proposed Changes**  
Modify the `set_val` method for `RangeSlider` in `widgets.py` to comment out the `xy[4]` assignments. This ensures the initial values are properly set without causing an out-of-bounds error.

1. **File**: `matplotlib/widgets.py`
2. **Class**: `RangeSlider`
3. **Method**: `set_val`

### Detailed Changes

#### File: `matplotlib/widgets.py`
  - Locate the `RangeSlider` class.
  - Within the `RangeSlider` class, find the `set_val` method.
  - Comment out the lines involving the assignment to `xy[4]`.

Modify the `set_val` method as follows:

1. **Before:**
   

2. **After:**
   

These changes should allow the `RangeSlider` to initialize properly with user-defined values without causing an index out-of-bounds error.
