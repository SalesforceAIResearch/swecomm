### Title

Fix IndexError when initializing RangeSlider with custom values

### Problem

The `RangeSlider` widget in Matplotlib raises an `IndexError` when attempting to initialize it with custom values using the `valinit` parameter. The error occurs in the `set_val` method due to an attempt to assign a value to an out-of-bounds index in the `xy` array.

### Analysis

The root cause of the issue is within the `set_val` method of the `RangeSlider` class. Specifically, the issue arises from the following lines in the method:

This line should set the value of the fifth element in the `xy` array, defining the polygon shape for the slider. However, the `xy` array does not always have an element at index 4, especially during initialization or if the `xy` array is not correctly defined.

The `xy` array is supposed to have coordinates for defining the polygon of the slider. In both the vertical and horizontal orientations, there are typically only four points that define the slider's polygon:
1. `.25, val[0]`
2. `.25, val[1]`
3. `.75, val[1]`
4. `.75, val[0]`

Including a fifth point by setting `xy[4]` is unnecessary and was likely a mistake in the original implementation.

### Proposed Changes

To fix the issue:

1. **Edit the `set_val` method in the `RangeSlider` class** to remove the unnecessary line setting `xy[4]`. This method should be located in the `matplotlib/widgets.py` file.

File: `matplotlib/widgets.py`

- Locate the `set_val` method of the `RangeSlider` class. In both the vertical and horizontal orientation blocks, remove the lines that set the 5th index of `xy`:

- Save the changes in the `matplotlib/widgets.py` file.

### Summary

Removing the line of code that attempts to set `xy[4]` in both the vertical and horizontal blocks of the `set_val` method will prevent the `IndexError` and allow the `RangeSlider` widget to be initialized with custom values via the `valinit` parameter. 

This will ensure that the `RangeSlider` works as intended when given initial values without encountering an out-of-bounds error.
