**Title**: Fix IndexError in RangeSlider Initialization by Adjusting Polygon Vertices

**Problem**: 
When initializing a `RangeSlider` with a `valinit` parameter, an `IndexError` occurs due to the line `xy[4] = val[0], .25` in the `set_val` method. This prevents the `RangeSlider` from being initialized correctly with user-provided values.

**Analysis**:
The root of the problem lies in the part of the code where the vertices of the polygon (`self.poly.xy`) are being set to update the sliderâ€™s handle position. Specifically, the line `xy[4] = val[0], .25` is causing an `IndexError` because the polygon does not have an index 4. The polygon representing the slider handle typically has four vertices, corresponding to its four corners. The fifth vertex (index 4) is unnecessary and should not be accessed.

To fix the issue, the offending line `xy[4]` should be commented out or removed because it attempts to access an out-of-bounds index. This line doesn't serve a legitimate purpose in updating the handle's position and removing it does not affect the functionality.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `matplotlib/widgets.py`
   - **Function**: `set_val`
     - **Change**: Comment out the line `xy[4] = .25, val[0]` for vertical orientation and `xy[4] = val[0], .25` for horizontal orientation. 

**Detailed Steps**:
1. Locate the `set_val` method within the `RangeSlider` class in `matplotlib/widgets.py`.
2. Inside the `set_val` method, find the block of code that updates `self.poly.xy` based on orientation (`vertical` or `horizontal`).
3. Comment out or remove the line attempting to set `xy[4]`.


     if self.orientation == "vertical":
         xy[0] = .25, val[0]
         xy[1] = .25, val[1]
         xy[2] = .75, val[1]
         xy[3] = .75, val[0]
         xy[4] = .25, val[0]
     
     if self.orientation == "vertical":
         xy[0] = .25, val[0]
         xy[1] = .25, val[1]
         xy[2] = .75, val[1]
         xy[3] = .75, val[0]
         # xy[4] = .25, val[0]
     
     else:
         xy[0] = val[0], .25
         xy[1] = val[0], .75
         xy[2] = val[1], .75
         xy[3] = val[1], .25
         xy[4] = val[0], .25
     
     else:
         xy[0] = val[0], .25
         xy[1] = val[0], .75
         xy[2] = val[1], .75
         xy[3] = val[1], .25
         # xy[4] = val[0], .25
     ```

After making these changes, the `RangeSlider` should initialize correctly with the `valinit` parameter without raising an `IndexError`.
