**Title: Fix ForeignKey's to_field Parameter When Renaming a PrimaryKey**

**Problem:**
When renaming a PrimaryKey field in Django's migrations, the `to_field` parameter in `ForeignKey` referencing the renamed field points to the old field name instead of the new one.

**Analysis:**
The issue arises due to an oversight during the renaming of the PrimaryKey field. When the `RenameField` operation is completed, related foreign keys need to update their `to_field` parameters to refer to the new field name. This change is essential to maintain the correct references between models and prevent migration errors.

The root cause here is that the `RenameField` migration operation does not propagate the new primary key name to related foreign keys that explicitly specify the `to_field` parameter.

**Proposed Changes:**
To resolve this issue, we need to update the `RenameField` logic to ensure that any `ForeignKey` instances that reference the renamed field are correctly updated. The most relevant location for this change is within the migration operation file responsible for the `RenameField` logic, specifically in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`.

1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`
    - **Function**: `state_forwards`
    - **Update**: Before finishing the `state_forwards` operation, iterate through all models in the state to check for any `ForeignKey` references using the renamed field. If found, update the `to_field` to the new field name.

Here's how you can describe the necessary changes:

**Detailed Description of Changes:**

1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`
    - **Function**: `state_forwards`
      - Add logic at the end of the function to:
          - Iterate through each model and field in the state.
          - For each field, check if it is a `ForeignKey` and if its `to_field` parameter matches the `old_name`.
          - If a match is found, update the `to_field` parameter to the `new_name`.

This change ensures that any `ForeignKey` fields that reference the renamed `PrimaryKey` will be correctly updated in the migration state, maintaining the integrity of the database schema and preventing errors during migrations.
