**Title**: Refactor Media Merging Logic to Avoid Unnecessary MediaOrderConflictWarnings

**Problem**: Merging three or more `Media` objects in Django forms can result in unnecessary `MediaOrderConflictWarning` errors due to the constraints imposed by the order in which media files are added. This problem particularly arises when involving JavaScript files or CSS files that have dependencies. The current implementation imposes constraints that can lead to incorrect ordering of media files and misleading warnings.

**Analysis**: Django's current media merging implementation follows a sequential approach where each `Media` object is added in sequence. The merging logic does not adequately take into account the dependencies among media files, resulting in conflict warnings even when a valid order is achievable.

The root cause is in `Media.merge` method and the way `Media.__add__` method propagates the lists of CSS and JS files. When merging multiple `Media` objects, the order constraints of one merge can wrongly affect subsequent merges. For instance, merging the media of `ColorPicker` and `SimpleTextWidget` imposes that `color-picker.js` must come before `text-editor.js`, and merging this result with the media of `FancyTextWidget` reports a conflict with `text-editor-extras.js`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Refactor `merge` Method in `widgets.py`**:
   - Modify how the `merge` function in `django/forms/widgets.py` processes the order of elements to prevent falsely imposed constraints.
   - Instead of applying the constraints immediately, gather all media elements and resolve the correct order based on dependencies once all media files are collected.

2. **Enhance `__add__` Method in `widgets.py`**:
   - Update the `Media.__add__` method to handle the merging of multiple media lists more intelligently.
   - Ensure that it propagates the lists while checking for actual conflicts and dependencies.

3. **Adjust `_css` and `_js` Properties in `widgets.py`**:
   - Modify the properties computing the final list of CSS and JS files to support the new merge logic, filtering out duplicates and taking dependencies into account.

4. **Resolve Merge Order in `media_property` in `widgets.py`**:
   - Enhance the `media_property` method in `django/forms/widgets.py` to compute the final media list with the proper order after collecting all media components for a widget or form.

**Code Changes**:

- **File**: `django/forms/widgets.py`

1. **`merge` Method**:
   - Refactor the function to maintain a better ordering process and avoid improper constraints:



2. **`__add__` Method**:
   - Enhance the adding logic to accommodate dependency orders:



3. **`_css` and `_js` Properties**:
   - Adjust the logic within `_css` and `_js` to ensure a correct merged output by re-evaluating the order of each component:



4. **`media_property`**:
   - Improve the property method to utilize the enhanced merge logic:



By implementing these changes, Django should be able to merge multiple `Media` objects without unnecessary order conflict warnings, resulting in a more intuitive and expected order for the media files. This resolves the issue described, where the final order of JavaScript files must correctly account for their dependencies.
