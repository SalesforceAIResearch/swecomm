**Title**: Resolve Media Order Conflicts When Merging Multiple Media Objects

**Problem**:
When merging media objects in Django forms, an unnecessary `MediaOrderConflictWarning` is thrown. This happens because the mechanism that merges media files imposes constraints based on the order of merging rather than the actual dependencies of the files, causing a misleading result.

**Analysis**:
The core issue lies in the way the `Media` class handles the merging of JavaScript (JS) and CSS files. It does not respect the dependencies between the files and merely aggregates them in the order they are merged. This can result in Django imposing incorrect order dependencies that do not actually exist, leading to the warning.

Consider the following widgets:
- `ColorPicker` with `['color-picker.js']`
- `SimpleTextWidget` with `['text-editor.js']`
- `FancyTextWidget` with `['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']`

When these media objects are merged in the `MyForm` form, the order resolution process erroneously warns about conflicts such as 'text-editor-extras.js' needing to come before 'text-editor.js', which is a false conflict created solely by the order of merging.

To solve this, the logic should be revised to properly account for actual dependencies between media files, and then resolve the final order respecting these dependencies.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/forms/widgets.py`
   - **Function**: Modify the `combine` method of the `Media` class.
   - **Logic**:
     - Enhance the helper method that combines media file lists to detect and handle actual file dependencies.
     - Implement a topological sort algorithm to ensure that files are ordered based on their dependency relationships.
   - **Details**:
     - Identify dependent relationships in media files.
     - Ensure that the basic order is respected while resolving conflicts based on actual dependencies.

2. **File**: `django/forms/widgets.py`
   - **Function**: Modify the `__add__` method of the `Media` class.
   - **Logic**:
     - Ensure it calls the enhanced `combine` method.

### Specific Instructions:
1. **django/forms/widgets.py**
   - Locate the `Media` class.
   - Find the `__add__` method and identify the call to combine media lists.
   - Implement a dependency resolver, which can be a helper function or integration within the `combine` method.
   - Ensure the logic correctly identifies dependencies between files and orders them accordingly.
   - Ideally, sort the media files using a topological sorting algorithm.

### Example Steps:
1. **Modify the Combine Logic**:
   - Introduce a mapping to store dependencies.
   - Traverse through the media lists to populate the mapping with dependencies.
   - Apply a topological sort to resolve the correct order of media files respecting these dependencies.

2. **Update the Add Method**:
   - Ensure that when media objects are added, the dependency-aware sort is applied to the resultant media lists.

The changes made here should ensure that when multiple media objects are merged, their dependencies are respected, thereby avoiding unnecessary `MediaOrderConflictWarning` and resulting in a correct and intuitive order of media files.

**Note**: Ensure backward compatibility and thorough testing as changes to media handling can affect a broad range of functionalities in Django forms and admin modules.
