**Title**: Resolve Media Order Conflicts in Form Widgets Merging

**Problem**: 

Merging multiple media objects in Django forms can lead to unnecessary `MediaOrderConflictWarning` warnings. This occurs when dependencies between JavaScript files are not properly resolved, leading to an incorrect or unintuitive ordering of these files. 

In the given example, `text-editor-extras.js` depends on `text-editor.js`. However, merging media from `ColorPicker`, `SimpleTextWidget`, and `FancyTextWidget` results in an incorrect order where `text-editor-extras.js` appears before `text-editor.js`, contradicting the dependency and causing warnings.

**Analysis**:

1. **Root Cause**: When merging media objects, the current order-checking mechanism does not correctly account for dependencies between the JavaScript files. Specifically, it fails to recognize that `text-editor.js` should always precede `text-editor-extras.js`.

2. **Order Constraint**: The order of JS files in the final merged media should respect any inherent dependencies among them prescribed by each widgetâ€™s `Media` class.

3. **Merging Logic**: The merge operation must be adjusted to ensure that dependencies are respected, possibly using a more sophisticated algorithm such as topological sorting to maintain the correct order.

**Proposed Changes**:

**File**: `django/forms/widgets.py`

1. **Update the Media Merging Logic**:
    - Modify the logic that merges the JavaScript files from different `Media` classes. Ensure that dependencies specified by the order in individual widget `Media.js` lists are respected in the final merged list.
    - Implement a topological sorting mechanism to resolve the dependencies among the JavaScript files. This will involve:
      - Representing the dependency order as a directed graph.
      - Applying topological sorting to derive a valid order that respects all dependencies.

2. **Analyze and Adjust Media Merging**:
    - When encountering a `MediaOrderConflictWarning`, instead of issuing a warning, attempt to reorder the files to resolve the conflict based on known dependencies.

3. **Testing with Example Widgets**:
    - Test the updated merge logic with the provided example (`ColorPicker`, `SimpleTextWidget`, `FancyTextWidget`, and `MyForm`) to ensure the final order of JS files is correct: `['text-editor.js', 'text-editor-extras.js', 'color-picker.js']`.

4. **Refactor the Existing Code**:
    - Refactor existing code segments that perform media merging operations to utilize the new ordering mechanism.

Here are the detailed changes:

1. **Detect Dependencies**: Enhance the `Media` class to track dependencies among scripts.

2. **Topological Sort Implementation**: 
    - Implement a method in the `Media` class that uses topological sort to resolve script orders.

3. **Merge Method Adjustment**:
    - Adjust the merge method to apply topological sorting whenever JavaScript files are combined from multiple `Media` instances.

Note: Review all occurrences of media object merging in the file to ensure that the new logic is consistently applied.

By implementing these changes, the Media merging functionality will correctly handle dependencies, ensuring that JavaScript files are loaded in the correct order, and eliminating unnecessary `MediaOrderConflictWarning` warnings.
