**Title**: Fix Multi-level FilteredRelation with select_related() to Set Correct Related Object

**Problem**: When using `FilteredRelation` with `select_related()` in a multi-level relationship, the wrong related object is being set. This results in failed test cases where objects obtained through `select_related()` do not match their expected related objects.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue is that `select_related` is not correctly associating nested FilteredRelations. In multi-level relationships, the wrong related object is being fetched. This could be due to an improper join or a flaw in how relationships are being resolved and selected.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **django/db/models/query.py**:
   - Investigate and potentially modify the `select_related` resolving part to ensure that the nested `FilteredRelation` objects are correctly associated.
   
   - Specifically, review the logic where joins are created and ensure that the correct tables/fields are being referenced in nested relationships.

2. **django/db/models/sql/query.py**:
   - Explore the `setup_joins` method to verify if the joins are being correctly configured for multi-level `FilteredRelation`.
   
   - Modify the join conditions or sequence if they are not nesting properly. Ensure that the relational paths (joins) respect the hierarchy defined by `FilteredRelation`.

3. **django/db/models/related.py**:
   - Review how related fields are being instantiated and validated, especially in the context of `FilteredRelation` with `select_related`.

   - Make adjustments to ensure that the correct related fields are being fetched and linked even in deeply nested relationships.

4. **Potentially affected method**:
   - Look into the chain of methods involving `select_related`, `FilteredRelation`, and how joins are performed. This may involve `add_select_related`, `get_related_selections`, or similar methods responsible for query construction.

Each of these files and methods tie directly into how Django ORM constructs SQL queries, resolves relationships, and ultimately fetches related objects.

**Steps to Implement**:
1. **django/db/models/query.py**:
   - Find the part of the code where `select_related` is being processed.
   - Apply a more robust logic to handle nested `FilteredRelation`.

2. **django/db/models/sql/query.py**:
   - Specifically, examine and adjust the `setup_joins` method to ensure that the SQL joins correctly reflect the hierarchy of nested relations.

3. **django/db/models/related.py**:
   - Make sure related field retrieval respects nested `FilteredRelation` paths.

4. **Testing and Validation**:
   - After making these changes, rerun the problematic test case to ensure it passes.
   - Add additional test scenarios to cover various nested `FilteredRelation` configurations and ensure all pass.

These changes should be limited to the indicated files without altering the overall structure or introducing new files. Only once these specific areas are corrected should you proceed to validate through comprehensive testing that all nested relations perform as expected without regression in other areas of the ORM.
