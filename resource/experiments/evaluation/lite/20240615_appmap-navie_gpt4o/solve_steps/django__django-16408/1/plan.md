**Title**: Fix Multi-level FilteredRelation with `select_related` to Set Correct Related Object

**Problem**: 
The `select_related()` method in conjunction with multi-level `FilteredRelation` is setting the wrong related object. Specifically, for a given queryset that joins multiple related objects, the wrong related instance is being returned, leading to assertion errors in tests.

**Analysis**: 
The problem likely results from how `select_related()` constructs its SQL and how the ORM maps the column values back to model instances. With multi-level filters in `FilteredRelation`, thereâ€™s a possibility that the SQL joins are misinterpreted, causing the ORM to link the wrong instances together. This is especially evident in nested or complex relationships where multiple foreign keys come into play, leading to ambiguity in assigning objects.

To solve this, the logic in the method that handles `select_related()` needs to be carefully examined for properly accounting multi-level filtered relations and ensuring that the correct related objects are set.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`**
    - Update the `_setup_joins` method to handle cases where `select_related` is used with `FilteredRelation`. 
    - Ensure that the joins are established correctly and that the appropriate table aliases are used to avoid conflicts or overwrites of related instances.

2. **Function: `_setup_joins(self, name, opts, alias, outer_if_first, nullable, reuse=None)`**
    - Update the SQL construction logic to correctly handle filter conditions passed using `FilteredRelation`.
    - Modify the method to ensure that table joins respect the hierarchy of filters and do not overwrite previously established relationships.

3. **File: `django/db/models/query.py`**
    - Update the `_clone` method to ensure `select_related` maintains correct state through the cloning process.

4. **Function: `_add_select_related(self, field, sub_related_fields)`**
    - Ensure the method respects the nesting levels of `FilteredRelation` and constructs the correct SQL statement for fetching related objects.

This change should ensure that multi-level `select_related` queries with `FilteredRelation` correctly respect the associated filters and set the related objects properly.

Make these modifications without altering existing tests or documentation. Validate the fix by rerunning the specified failing test case and ensuring it passes without any errors.
