**Title**: Update `_calc_concat_over` and `concat` Functions to Handle Missing Variables When Concatenating Datasets

**Problem**: 
Currently, xarray's `xarray.concat` function requires datasets to have the same variables. If the datasets have different variables, the user must either create dummy variables filled with `NaN` in datasets that don't have them or drop mismatched variables entirely. This is inconvenient and inconsistent with Pandas' `pd.concat`, which handles such cases more gracefully. The enhancement requested is to allow `xarray.concat` to handle datasets with missing variables by automatically filling in `NaN` for missing variables.

**Analysis**:
To solve this issue, we need to modify the logic within the `_calc_concat_over` function in the `xarray/core/concat.py` file and ensure that the changes propagate correctly to all functions that call it, most notably `concat`. The `_calc_concat_over` function is responsible for determining which dataset variables need to be concatenated in the result. We need to update this function so that it can gracefully handle missing variables by automatically inserting `NaN` filled variables where needed. This involves:

1. Identifying the variables that need to be concatenated.
2. Creating placeholders for missing variables filled with `NaN`.
3. Ensuring that the concatenation logic accommodates these placeholders.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: `xarray/core/concat.py`**
    - **Function: `_calc_concat_over`**
        - Modify this function to:
            - Identify all unique variables across all provided datasets.
            - Create a set of these variables.
            - For each dataset, check for missing variables and insert `NaN` filled arrays as placeholders.
            - Perform existing concatenation logic on the updated datasets.

    - **Function: `concat`** (if applicable within the same file):
        - Ensure it uses the modified `_calc_concat_over` function to handle missing variables.
        - Test the concatenation process to ensure insertion of `NaN` placeholders works as expected.

2. **General Logic Changes**:
    - Use the variable checking mechanism within `_calc_concat_over`.
    - For missing variables in each dataset, create a new variable with the appropriate dimensions filled with `NaN`.
    - Continue concatenation as normal, now with all datasets containing the full set of necessary variables.

The existing snippets in the context that need to change are located within `xarray/core/concat.py`. The following outlines the main updates needed:

1. **Refactor `_calc_concat_over` to handle missing variables:**
    - Analyze each dataset in the provided list for its set of variables.
    - Determine the full set of unique variables across all datasets.
    - For datasets missing certain variables, create and initialize these variables with `NaN`.
    - Update the concatenation logic to utilize the new sets of variables.

2. **Propagate these changes in the `concat` logic to effectively manage the new datasets with filled placeholders:**
    - Update internal calls and structures to ensure the modified datasets (with `NaN` placeholders) are used.
    - Validate overall functionality to ensure there is no breakage in other parts of the `xarray.concat` workflow.

By implementing these changes, `xarray.concat` will be able to handle datasets with different variables more efficiently, aligning its behavior with the more user-friendly behavior of `pd.concat`.

Remember to test the updated functions thoroughly with datasets having different variable sets and ensure that the final concatenated dataset correctly includes `NaN` filled values for missing variables.
