**Title**: Modify `xarray.concat` to Ignore Missing Variables During Concatenation

**Problem**: The `xarray.concat` function currently requires datasets to have matching variables, leading to cumbersome workarounds such as creating dummy variables filled with `NaN` in datasets that lack them or dropping mismatched variables entirely. Users need a more straightforward way to concatenate datasets with different variables, similar to how `pd.concat` performs an outer join.

**Analysis**: The current behavior of the `xarray.concat` function enforces strict matching of variables across datasets, which is inconvenient for users dealing with datasets that have different variables. This rigid approach contrasts with the behavior of `pd.concat`, which performs an outer join and handles mismatched columns more gracefully.

To address this issue, the `xarray.concat` function should be modified to include an option for ignoring missing variables. When enabled, this option would allow the concatenation process to proceed without requiring all datasets to have the same variables. Missing variables in any dataset would simply be filled with `NaN` values, making the process more user-friendly and consistent with the behavior of `pd.concat`.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Update `xarray/core/concat.py`**:
   - Modify the `_calc_concat_over` function to handle missing variables more gracefully.
   - Introduce a parameter, such as `ignore_missing_vars`, to specify whether to ignore missing variables.
   - Update the logic to fill missing variables with `NaN` during the concatenation process.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:

1. **xarray/core/concat.py**:
    - **_calc_concat_over() function**:
      - Update the logic to allow for an optional parameter `ignore_missing_vars`.
      - Modify the loop that determines which variables to concatenate, ensuring that missing variables are handled correctly when `ignore_missing_vars` is set to `True`.
      - Ensure that datasets are filled with `NaN` for missing variables when `ignore_missing_vars` is enabled.

Additional changes might be required to integrate this new parameter seamlessly across other functions and methods that utilize `_calc_concat_over`.

By implementing these changes, the `xarray.concat` function will become more flexible and easier to use, especially for users dealing with datasets with different variables.
