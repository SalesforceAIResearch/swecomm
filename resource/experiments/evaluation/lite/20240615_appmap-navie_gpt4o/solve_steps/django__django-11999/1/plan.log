**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Cannot override get_FOO_display() in Django 2.2+.
Description
	
I cannot override the get_FIELD_display function on models since version 2.2. It works in version 2.1.
Example:
class FooBar(models.Model):
	foo_bar = models.CharField(_("foo"), choices=[(1, 'foo'), (2, 'bar')])
	def __str__(self):
		return self.get_foo_bar_display() # This returns 'foo' or 'bar' in 2.2, but 'something' in 2.1
	def get_foo_bar_display(self):
		return "something"
What I expect is that I should be able to override this function.
