### Title
Fix inability to override `get_FIELD_display` in Django 2.2+

### Problem
The `get_FIELD_display` method in Django 2.2 cannot be overridden as expected. This method worked correctly in Django 2.1, allowing developers to customize the display value of a `choices` field by overriding the method in the model class.

### Analysis
In Django 2.1, overriding the `get_FIELD_display` method in a model to provide a custom implementation worked as expected. However, in Django 2.2, this functionality appears to be broken, meaning that the method override provided by the user is not being called, and instead, the default implementation is used.

The root cause seems to be related to changes in the Django core related to how model methods are resolved and invoked. These changes may have altered the mechanism or the order in which methods are resolved, and as a result, the overridden method in the user-defined model is not called.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Modify the `Field` class**:
   - Investigate the internal implementation of the `get_FIELD_display` method within the `Field` class in Django core.

2. **Ensure method resolution**:
   - Ensure the user-defined `get_FIELD_display` method is called by updating the `Field` class to incorporate method resolution order checks and prioritize user-defined methods as expected.

3. **Modify django/contrib/admin/utils.py**:
   - Update this file as it appears to be involved with the handling and display of model fields, particularly for admin functionalities. By ensuring the `get_FIELD_display` method calls are correctly directed, the issue will be mitigated.

### Exact Changes

**File:** `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`

1. In the section where field display functions are invoked, ensure the dynamically constructed method names like `get_FIELD_display` check for the existence of overridden methods in the model instance before falling back to the default implementation.

   - Update the `display_for_field` function to include a check for custom definitions of `get_FIELD_display` on the model instance.

#### Changes in `display_for_field` function (lines 403-421):



By checking if the model instance has a callable `get_FIELD_display` method, the overridden method will be used if available.

This should ensure that the custom `get_FIELD_display` method provided by the user is invoked correctly, restoring the overridden behavior as expected in Django 2.1.
