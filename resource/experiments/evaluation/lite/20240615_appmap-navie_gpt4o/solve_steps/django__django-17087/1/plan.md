**Title**: Correct default value reference for nested class methods in migrations

**Problem**: 
The current Django migration script for adding a new field references a class method from a nested class (e.g., `Capability.default`) using an incorrect path. The script erroneously refers to the nested class method with an incomplete path (i.e., `appname.models.Capability.default`). This results in an error during migrations since it should refer to `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default`.

**Analysis**: 
When generating migrations that include the default value for a field, Django must correctly resolve and refer to the path of the default value function, especially for methods belonging to nested classes. Here's what happens in the provided context:

1. The model `Profile` contains a nested class `Capability`.
2. The `Capability` class has a class method `default`.
3. The `capabilities` field in `Profile` uses `Capability.default` as its default value.
4. During migration generation, Django incorrectly identifies the path of `Capability.default` as `appname.models.Capability.default` instead of the fully qualified path `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default`.

The migration code needs to ensure the correct resolution of the path for nested classes and methods.

**Proposed Changes**: 
We will focus on modifying the `state_forwards` method in the relevant operations classes to correctly resolve the path for nested class methods used as default values.

File: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`

1. **Modify AddField class**:
    - Update the `state_forwards` method to correctly construct the path for nested class methods.
    - Ensure that the migrated default value has the fully qualified path.

2. **Modify AlterField class**:
    - Similarly, update the `state_forwards` method in the `AlterField` class to correctly handle nested class methods.

Here is a detailed description of the necessary changes:

1. **AddField Class**:
    - In the `state_forwards` method, modify the logic that assigns the default value to ensure it includes the fully qualified path of the nested class method if it exists.

2. **AlterField Class**:
    - Similarly, update the `state_forwards` method to handle nested classes correctly for the field's default value.

With these changes, references to nested class methods should be accurately reflected in the migrations, preventing errors during the migration process.

By ensuring the paths are resolved correctly for nested class methods, the migration will correctly reference `appname.models.Profile.Capability.default` instead of the erroneous `appname.models.Capability.default`.
