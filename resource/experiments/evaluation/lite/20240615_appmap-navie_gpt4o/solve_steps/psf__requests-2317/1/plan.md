**Title: Handle Binary Strings in HTTP Methods in requests/sessions.py**

**Problem:** 
Neutronclient converts all values, including the HTTP method, to binary strings (`b'method'`). In Python 3.4 and requests 2.4.3, the method is transformed into a literal string like `"b'method'"`, causing a 404 Not Found response. This issue doesn't occur in Python 2.6 due to inherent differences between Python 2 and Python 3 string handling.

**Analysis:**
The method assignment in `requests/sessions.py` currently treats the method as a simple string conversion without checking if it's a binary string. When `builtin_str` is used on a binary string in Python 3, it converts the binary string to a string with a `b'...'` format. This mishandles the HTTP method, as `requests` eventually sends an incorrect method string such as `"b'GET'"` instead of just `"GET"`.

Python 2 naturally handles string conversions between binary and text formats differently, which is why the issue doesn't manifest there.

To fix this, we need to ensure that if the method is a binary string, it is properly decoded to a normal string before being passed to `requests`.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **requests/sessions.py**:
   - Modify the method assignment so that it checks if the method is a binary string.
   - If the method is a binary string, decode it to a standard string before assigning it to `method`.
   
   **Describe the function and logic that should be modified:**
   - In the function, where `method = builtin_str(method)` is present.
     - Check if `method` is an instance of `bytes`.
     - If it is, decode it using UTF-8 or ASCII encoding.
     - Assign the decoded method back to `method`.

**Detailed Changes:**

1. In `requests/sessions.py`, locate the relevant function/method containing `method = builtin_str(method)`.

2. Update the method assignment logic as follows:
   - Add a check to see if `method` is an instance of `bytes`.
   - If true, decode `method` using UTF-8 or ASCII (dependent on how the project typically handles byte-to-string conversions).
   - Proceed with assigning the decoded string to `method`.

This makes the code more robust by handling both binary and non-binary strings, ensuring compatibility with neutronclient and similar cases where methods might be binary strings.

By implementing this fix, `requests` can handle HTTP methods whether they come in as standard strings or byte strings, preventing incorrect literal string conversions that lead to HTTP errors.
