**Title**: Fix KeyError in pairplot with MultiIndex DataFrame by adjusting column access

**Problem**: 
The `pairplot` function in Seaborn raises a `KeyError` when attempting to pairplot a MultiIndex DataFrame. The error occurs because the method `map_diag` and other internal functions in the `pairplot` process try to access DataFrame columns directly, but do not expect them to be MultiIndex columns, leading to a mismatch and ultimately a KeyError.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue is that the `pairplot` implementation does not account for MultiIndex columns when it expects single-level column names. The function `_index_to_label` is used to convert indices to labels but fails to handle MultiIndex correctly. Whenever the column names become `MultiIndex`, many internal operations relying on simple column names break, leading to a KeyError.

To solve this issue, we can modify the code to ensure that MultiIndex columns are handled by converting MultiIndex to a suitable flattened representation before processing.

**Proposed Changes**:
To fix this issue, we'll modify relevant parts of Seaborn's `pairplot` logic to ensure it can handle MultiIndex columns gracefully. Specifically, we will focus on `_index_to_label` and its usage in the file `seaborn/matrix.py`.

1. **Modify `_index_to_label` in `seaborn/matrix.py`**:
    - Update `_index_to_label` to handle `MultiIndex` columns by combining the levels into a single string that can be used for subsequent operations in Seaborn.

2. **Update `pairplot` Logic to Use Flattened Column Names in `seaborn/axisgrid.py`**:
    - Ensure that wherever DataFrame columns are accessed, the columns are first flattened if they are MultiIndex.

**seaborn/matrix.py**:
- Update `_index_to_label` function at line 39.


Modify other functions using `_index_to_label` to flatten column names, for example at lines 77, 112, 136, and 156.

**seaborn/axisgrid.py**:
- In `pairplot`, at the lines where `self.data[var]` is accessed, ensure columns are flattened if they are a MultiIndex.



By ensuring that the column handling is robust against MultiIndex, the `pairplot` function will handle MultiIndex DataFrames without error. If necessary, similar updates should be performed throughout the codebase wherever DataFrame columns are accessed directly.

This plan outlines the necessary changes to accommodate MultiIndex columns within the Seaborn package, ensuring the `pairplot` and similar functions work without issue.
