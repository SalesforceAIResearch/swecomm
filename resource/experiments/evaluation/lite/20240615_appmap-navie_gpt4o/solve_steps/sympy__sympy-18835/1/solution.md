Based on the described issue, here are the necessary code changes to the `uniq` function in the `bench_R5` function. The modification ensures that a `RuntimeError` is raised if the list size changes during the iteration.

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">sympy/benchmarks/bench_symbench.py</file>
<original line-count="14" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
def uniq(x):
    v = set(x)
    return v
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
def uniq(x):
    initial_length = len(x)
    v = set(x)
    if initial_length != len(x):
        raise RuntimeError("List size changed during iteration")
    return v
]]></modified>
</change>
```

This change records the initial length of the list, converts the list elements to a set, and checks if the length of the list has changed. If the list length is different at the end of the process compared to the beginning, a `RuntimeError` is raised.
