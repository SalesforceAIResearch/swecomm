**Title**: Modify `uniq` function to raise RuntimeError when input list size changes during iteration

**Problem**: The current implementation of the `uniq` function in the `bench_R5` benchmark modifies the input list directly. This can lead to silent errors if the list size changes during iteration, which is inconsistent with Python's behavior for dictionaries and sets.

**Analysis**: 
The `uniq` function is designed to remove duplicate elements from the input list by converting it into a set and returning the set. However, if the input list is modified during iteration, it can lead to unintended behavior and incorrect results. To prevent this, the function should raise a `RuntimeError` if the list size changes during iteration.

To implement this:
1. Record the size of the input list at the start of the function.
2. Iterate over the elements of the list and convert them into a set.
3. Check the size of the list before and after each iteration. 
4. Raise a `RuntimeError` if the size of the list changes during the iteration.

**Proposed Changes**:
File: `sympy/benchmarks/bench_symbench.py`

1. Modify the `uniq` function definition inside the `bench_R5` function.
   - Record the initial size of the list.
   - During iteration, check the size of the list and raise a `RuntimeError` if it changes.

Detailed changes:
- Before starting the iteration, store the initial length of the list.
- Iterate over the list as usual, converting elements to a set.
- At the end of the list conversion, check if the end length matches the initial length.
- If the lengths do not match, raise a `RuntimeError` with an appropriate message.

This ensures that if the list is attempted to be modified during the iteration, an error is raised, alerting the user and preventing silent incorrect outputs.

By implementing these changes, we enhance the robustness of the `uniq` function, making it consistent with Python's behavior for other collection types when modified during iteration.
