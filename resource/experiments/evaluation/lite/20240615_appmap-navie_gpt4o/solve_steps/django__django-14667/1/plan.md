**Title**: Fix QuerySet.defer() to Properly Clear Deferred Fields when Chained with only()

**Problem**: 
When chaining `.only()` and `.defer()` function calls on a Django QuerySet, the resulting SQL query does not correctly defer the specified fields. For example, chaining `.only("name")` with `.defer("name")` is expected to result in a query that does not select the "name" field. However, the query selects all fields instead, indicating that the deferred field is not being properly managed.

**Analysis**:
The core issue is with how the fields to defer are being stored and manipulated within the QuerySet. Defer and only operations should be handling field inclusions and exclusions explicitly:
1. `.only()` should define a whitelist of fields to select.
2. `.defer()` should remove fields from the inclusion list or add them to the exclusion list.

When fields are specified in `.only()` and later deferred using `.defer()`, those fields should either be excluded from the inclusion list or processed accordingly to ensure only the necessary fields are selected.

**Proposed Changes**:
The file changes will be focused on `django/db/models/query.py` where the QuerySet methods for `.only()` and `.defer()` are defined. 

1. **django/db/models/query.py**:
   - Modify the `.only()` method to explicitly manage the fields in the inclusion list.
   - Modify the `.defer()` method to effectively remove the specified fields from the inclusion list if they are part of an earlier `.only()` operation.

   **Description of changes**:
   - **only() Method**:
     - Extend logic to maintain a list of explicitly included fields.
   - **defer() Method**:
     - Adjust logic to remove fields from the inclusion list defined by previously applied `.only()` operations.
     - Ensure no redundant fields are included in the final query.

By focusing on these changes, we align the behavior of `.defer()` to ensure it respects previous `.only()` calls and correctly generates the SQL with the appropriate field selections.

Note: Ensure all the logic handling the field processing is within the file `django/db/models/query.py` to maintain integrity and coherence of QuerySet operations.

With these changes, the resulting SQL queries will correctly defer and include fields as intended, yielding the expected results for chained `.only()` and `.defer()` operations.
