**Title**: Fix Python code printer to correctly handle tuple with one element

**Problem**:
The Python code printer in SymPy 1.10 fails to generate a correct tuple with one element. Specifically, it omits the necessary comma after a single element in the tuple, causing it to be interpreted as an integer instead of a tuple. This discrepancy between versions 1.9 and 1.10 breaks user code that relies on the return type being a tuple.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue appears to be in the Python code printer where it handles the conversion of tuples to their string representations. In Python, a comma is needed after the element in a single-element tuple to distinguish it from a simple parenthesized expression. The code printer should ensure that when generating code for a tuple with one element, this comma is included.

**Proposed Changes**:
We should modify the Python code printer logic that generates code for tuples to ensure it correctly handles cases where a tuple has only one element.

1. **File: sympy/plotting/experimental_lambdify.py**
   - Locate the part of the code where tuples are being processed for string conversion.
   - Add a conditional check to determine if the tuple has exactly one element.
   - If it does, ensure the resulting string representation includes the necessary trailing comma.

Detailed Change:
- Identify where the code generation or printing functions are implemented for lambdifying expressions, focusing primarily on the methods that deal with tuples and their string representations.

_Update specific logic for single-element tuples_:
- Add a case to handle the tuple with one element, ensuring the output includes a trailing comma within the tuple's string representation.

By applying this fix, the code printer should generate the correct output for single-element tuples, maintaining consistency with the expected behavior seen in previous SymPy versions.

The change should be integrated minimally to address the specific handling of single-element tuples without disturbing other parts of the tuple processing logic.

---

With these changes, the `lambdify` function in the example should work as expected, where single-element tuples are correctly printed with a comma after the element, preventing the regression observed in version 1.10.
