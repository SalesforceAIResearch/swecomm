**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Python code printer not respecting tuple with one element
Hi,

Thanks for the recent updates in SymPy! I'm trying to update my code to use SymPy 1.10 but ran into an issue with the Python code printer. MWE:


```python
import inspect
from sympy import lambdify

inspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1])))
```
SymPy 1.9 and under outputs:
```
'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1,)\n'
```

But SymPy 1.10 gives

```
'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1)\n'
```
Note the missing comma after `1` that causes an integer to be returned instead of a tuple. 

For tuples with two or more elements, the generated code is correct:
```python
inspect.getsource(lambdify([], tuple([1, 2])))
```
In SymPy  1.10 and under, outputs:

```
'def _lambdifygenerated():\n    return (1, 2... (1040)
