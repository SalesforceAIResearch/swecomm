**Title**: Resolve Module Imported Twice Issue under ImportMode.importlib

**Problem**: 
In a pytest-based testing setup, switching from pkg_resources style namespace packaging to PEP 420 namespace packages and using `importlib` as the `import-mode` is causing module duplication. This leads to the initialization code affecting a different instance of the module than the one being later accessed, causing `AttributeError` when accessing the module's state.

**Analysis**:
The key issue arises from two different versions of the same module (`pmxbot.logging`) being present in `sys.modules`. This can happen when `importlib` loads a module differently than the default import mechanism, particularly in namespace packages. The `initialize` function modifies one instance of `pmxbot.logging` while the test accesses another, leading to inconsistent state and errors.

The usage of `importlib` in `import_mode` can sometimes cause conflicts between dynamically inserted paths and pre-existing paths within `sys.modules`. To ensure consistent imports, care must be taken to control the path and module loading properly.

**Proposed Changes**:
We need to ensure that the module is only imported once by managing `sys.modules` and potentially reworking our import logic to avoid conflicts. Let's focus on modifying `src/_pytest/pathlib.py`, which handles custom import logic.

1. **src/_pytest/pathlib.py**:
    - In the `import_path` function around line 508-532:
      - Before calling `importlib.import_module()`, check if the module is already in `sys.modules` and use the existing module if it exists. This prevents creating duplicate module instances.

    - In the function where `spec.loader.exec_module(mod)` is called:
      - After importing the module, ensure that it is properly registered under the intended name in `sys.modules`.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Modify the `import_path` function**:
   - Extend the import logic to first check `sys.modules` before proceeding with an import. If the module is found in `sys.modules`, simply return that instance.



2. **Adjust import-related hooks**:
   - Ensure that wherever the import logic affects `sys.modules`, it reuses the existing entries if available.



By making these changes, the duplicate imports due to `importlib` should be mitigated, ensuring that `pmxbot.logging` remains a single instance throughout the testing process. This should resolve the issue of inconsistent states and `AttributeError`. 

Review and ensure these changes are properly tested within a controlled environment before deploying them across the entire test suite. This will ensure that the fix does not introduce new issues.
