**Title**: Consolidate Import Paths to Avoid Duplicate Imports Under Importlib Mode

**Problem**: 
Module `pmxbot.logging` is being imported twice under the `importlib` import mode. This causes the effects of `core.initialize()` not to persist correctly across the different module instances. Specifically, a class variable `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store` does not appear to be set as expected, leading to an `AttributeError` during testing.

**Analysis**:
The core issue arises from the fact that the module `pmxbot.logging` is being loaded twice but as two separate instances. This is evident from the fact that `sys.modules['pmxbot.logging']` and `logging` are not the same object during testing, despite them supposedly representing the same module.

Here are key areas to address:
- Ensure that all imports of `pmxbot.logging` are consistent and fully qualified to prevent dual imports.
- Check the use of relative imports and ensure they are replaced with absolute imports.
- Verify how the `importlib` import mode affects module paths and adjust the configurations (like `sys.path` adjustments) accordingly to avoid shadowing.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **src/_pytest/logging.py**
   - Explicitly check for and handle cases where the module might be imported twice under different paths/names.
   - Ensure `sys.path` is configured to avoid dual-import issues.

Here are the changes to be made:

- **src/_pytest/logging.py**:
  - Adjust the import mechanisms.
  - Validate the initial configuration and import paths to ensure no overlap or shadowing occurs.

### Detailed Steps

1. **src/_pytest/logging.py**:

   - Ensure all imports are absolute and consistent.

   

   - Check and adjust the points where `pmxbot.logging` is imported.

   

2. **Unit Test Adjustment**:
   - Ensure the tests are also importing modules consistently.

   

By following these steps, the dual import issue under `importlib` should be resolved, ensuring that actions performed in `core.initialize()` are consistently reflected across the application's module instances.
