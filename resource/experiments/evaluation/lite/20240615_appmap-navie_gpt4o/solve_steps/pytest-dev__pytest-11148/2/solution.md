Based on the provided context and issue description, the goal is to ensure consistent and fully qualified imports to avoid dual imports and their related issues.

Here is the change that needs to be made to address this problem:

### Changes Required:
1. Consolidate the import path of `pmxbot.logging` to prevent it from being imported twice under different module instances. This change will be carried out in the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file.

### Code Changes:
Here is the specific change to be made for the src/_pytest/logging.py file:

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">src/_pytest/logging.py</file>

import pmxbot.logging  # Ensure consistent import path
]]></modified>
</change>
```

This modification ensures that the `pmxbot.logging` module is always imported under a consistent module path, avoiding the issue of multiple imports under different instances. 

Ensure all imports in other parts of the application follow this same pattern.

Lastly, please validate this change through your testing suite to confirm that the dual import issue is resolved. If there are additional areas in the codebase where `pmxbot.logging` is imported differently, you will need to adjust those imports similarly.
