**Title: Ensure a Single Import Path for pmxbot.logging Module with Importlib**

**Problem**: 
When running tests after switching to `importlib` in order to use PEP 420 namespace packages, the `pmxbot.logging` module appears to be imported twice under different paths. This causes `core.initialize()` to set attributes on one instance of the `pmxbot.logging.Logger` class, but in tests, another instance is used, leading to attributes (like `store`) not being found.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because `pmxbot.logging` is being imported twice under different keys in `sys.modules`. This can happen when the same directory structure can be accessed via multiple paths or when different import methods generate different module entries. In this case, `pmxbot.logging` ends up being accessed both directly and indirectly, causing the system to treat them as separate modules.

A common cause is the relative versus absolute imports or discrepancies introduced by `importlib` in handling namespaces.

To solve this issue, we need to ensure that the `pmxbot.logging` module is consistently imported using a single canonical pathname. This can be ensured by careful configuration and import handling to avoid discrepancies.

**Proposed Changes**:
Focus on the module initialization part where `core.initialize()` sets up the `logging.Logger.store`. Ensure that imports are consistent across the codebase.

1. **Module Path Normalization**:
    - In the `core.initialize()` function or the appropriate initialization function, when you’re setting `pmxbot.logging.Logger.store`, ensure that the module is loaded through a consistent, absolute path using `importlib`.

2. **Update Imports**:
    - Ensure all imports throughout the codebase use the same import method and path. Ensure all modules refer to `pmxbot.logging` via absolute imports and do not use relative imports that could differ based on current working directory or import context.
    
    - Normalize imports in main modules or entry points to prevent inconsistencies. Specifically, fix imports in `tests/unit/test_commands.py` and related files to align with the main module's import approach.

3. **Change in src/_pytest/legacypath.py**:
    - Modify how and where the `Config` and `Session` classes are setting or getting the `rootdir`, `inifile`, or other related attributes. Ensure that whenever `pmxbot.logging` is used, there’s no chance of it being imported differently.
    - Instead of `import pmxbot.logging`, use `importlib` to enforce a consistent path, for example:
      
      
4. **Consistency in Imports**:
    - Add a centralized import normalization check or helper function in `core` initialization:
      
    - Call this function from the `core.initialize()` or before any major import of the `pmxbot.logging`.

**Changes Required**

File: `src/_pytest/legacypath.py`

- **Ensure Single Import Path using importlib**:
    - Add a utility function at the initialization point to ensure that `pmxbot.logging` is consistently imported using importlib and assigned back to `sys.modules` properly.
    
Add the following codes to the initialization function such as `pytest_load_initial_conftests`:



This should ensure `pmxbot.logging` is consistently imported, addressing the issue of it being present in `sys.modules` under different keys, thus resolving the `AttributeError`.
