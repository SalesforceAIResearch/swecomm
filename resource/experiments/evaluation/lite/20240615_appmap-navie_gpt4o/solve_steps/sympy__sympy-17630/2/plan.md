**Title**: Fix `BlockMatrix` multiplication with `ZeroMatrix` blocks

**Problem**: 
When performing block matrix multiplication (`_blockmul`) with `BlockMatrix` objects that contain `ZeroMatrix` blocks, the operation fails if multiplied successively more than once. This issue arises because the resulting blocks are instances of `Zero` rather than `ZeroMatrix`, causing an `AttributeError` when the code attempts to access the `cols` attribute.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the issue is that during the multiplication of `BlockMatrix` objects, the multiply operation between a matrix and a `ZeroMatrix` returns a `Zero` instead of retaining the `ZeroMatrix` type. This conversion to `Zero` leads to problems down the line when the code expects a matrix-like object with attributes such as `cols`.

To resolve this, the multiplication process within `_blockmul` should ensure that the result remains an instance of `ZeroMatrix` where applicable.

**Proposed Changes**: 

1. **File**: `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`

2. **Function: `_blockmul`**
   - Modify the block multiplication logic to check if the result is a `Zero` and convert it back to a `ZeroMatrix` of appropriate dimensions.
   
   Changes to `_blockmul` function:
   - After computing the resultant block (during the list comprehension or in the loop), check if the result is an instance of `Zero`. If it is, convert it to a `ZeroMatrix` with corresponding dimensions from the operands involved.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the modification:

- After each multiplication or block matrix operation, check if the result is `Zero`.
- If the result is `Zero`, create a new `ZeroMatrix` with dimensions matching the expected output block size (derived from the dimensions of the operand matrices involved in the multiplication).
  
   **Change Details**:
   

- Additionally, within the `block_collapse` or any other method which relies on `_blockmul`, ensure the same logic is consistently applied to prevent future discrepancies.

By ensuring that the multiplication result retains the `ZeroMatrix` type, subsequent operations will be able to handle these blocks correctly, avoiding the `AttributeError` and behaving as expected.

These changes will ensure that `ZeroMatrix` instances are correctly propagated through block matrix multiplications, preventing the reported exceptions.
