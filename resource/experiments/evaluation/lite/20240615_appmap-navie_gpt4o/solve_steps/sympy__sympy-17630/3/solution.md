Sure, let's make the necessary changes to ensure that zero blocks in `BlockMatrix` are consistently handled as `ZeroMatrix` objects during block matrix multiplication.

Here are the changes:

1. **File:** `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`
   - **Method `_blockmul`**: Update the method to convert `Zero` objects back to `ZeroMatrix` when necessary.

### Changes:

        result_blocks = self.blocks * other.blocks

        # Enforce ZeroMatrix type for zero blocks
        rows, cols = result_blocks.shape
        for i in range(rows):
            for j in range(cols):
                if result_blocks[i, j] is S.Zero:
                    block_shape = (
                        self.blocks[i, 0].shape[0],
                        other.blocks[0, j].shape[1]
                    )
                    result_blocks[i, j] = ZeroMatrix(*block_shape)

        return BlockMatrix(result_blocks)

    return self * other
]]></modified>
</change>
```

### Explanation:
1. **Checking Zero blocks:** After obtaining the result of the block multiplication, we iterate through each block of the resulting matrix.
2. **Replace Zero with ZeroMatrix:** For each zero block, we replace it with a `ZeroMatrix` of the appropriate shape based on the dimensions of blocks from the original matrices involved in the multiplication.

### Test Case:
To validate this change, we should add a test that involves multiple block multiplications including `ZeroMatrix` blocks. Here is a sample test case:

```python
from sympy import MatrixSymbol, ZeroMatrix, block_collapse, Matrix
from sympy.abc import n, m

def test_blockmul_with_zeromatrix():
    X = MatrixSymbol('X', n, n)
    Y = MatrixSymbol('Y', m, m)
    Z = MatrixSymbol('Z', n, m)
    B1 = BlockMatrix([[X, ZeroMatrix(n, m)], [ZeroMatrix(m, n), Y]])
    B2 = BlockMatrix([[ZeroMatrix(n, m), Z], [ZeroMatrix(m, n), ZeroMatrix(m, m)]])
    
    result = block_collapse(B1 * B2)
    
    # Check that zero blocks remain ZeroMatrix
    assert isinstance(result.blocks[0, 0], ZeroMatrix)
    assert isinstance(result.blocks[0, 1], MatrixSymbol)
    assert isinstance(result.blocks[1, 0], ZeroMatrix)
    assert isinstance(result.blocks[1, 1], ZeroMatrix)

test_blockmul_with_zeromatrix()
```

Make sure to integrate this test into your test suite to ensure that the fix is working correctly.
