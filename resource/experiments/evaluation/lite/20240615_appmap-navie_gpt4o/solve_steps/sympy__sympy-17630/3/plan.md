**Title:** Fix AttributeError for Zero object in BlockMatrix multiplication with ZeroMatrix

**Problem**
When performing multiple block multiplications on a `BlockMatrix` containing `ZeroMatrix` blocks, an exception is thrown due to the presence of `Zero` objects instead of `ZeroMatrix`. This is because certain blocks in the resulting matrix are `Zero` objects, which do not possess the required attributes, such as `.cols`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

**Analysis**
The root cause of this issue lies in the handling of zero blocks during block matrix multiplication. The `ZeroMatrix` blocks are being converted to `Zero` during the matrix operations, particularly in the `_blockmul` method. At some point during the multiplication process, any block that should be a `ZeroMatrix` ends up as a `Zero`, leading to the lack of the necessary attributes like `.cols`.

To address this, we need to ensure that `ZeroMatrix` blocks consistently retain their type and attributes throughout the operations. This can be accomplished by enforcing that zero blocks are explicitly converted to `ZeroMatrix` objects within the relevant methods.

**Proposed Changes**
1. **File:** sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py
   - **Method `_blockmul`**: Modify the method to ensure that zero blocks are enforced as `ZeroMatrix` objects. Specifically, handle the case where resulting blocks may be zero matrices but are represented as `Zero`. This can be done by checking the type of the resulting blocks during matrix multiplication and converting `Zero` objects back to `ZeroMatrix`.

**Detailed Changes:**
1. **Update `BlockMatrix._blockmul` method (from lines 164-185):**
   - After obtaining the result of the block multiplication, check if any element of the resulting blocks is `Zero`.
   - Convert any detected `Zero` objects back to `ZeroMatrix` of the corresponding dimensions.



By making this change, we maintain the structural integrity of zero blocks as `ZeroMatrix`, ensuring that all required attributes are present during subsequent operations.

**Validation:**
Once the changes are applied, test the following scenarios to ensure proper functionality:
   - Single block matrix multiplication involving `ZeroMatrix` blocks.
   - Multiple successive block matrix multiplications involving `ZeroMatrix` blocks.
   - Mixed block matrices containing both `MatrixSymbol` and `ZeroMatrix` blocks.

With these updates, the matrix operations will consistently handle zero blocks as `ZeroMatrix`, preventing the `AttributeError` and ensuring the operations complete successfully.
