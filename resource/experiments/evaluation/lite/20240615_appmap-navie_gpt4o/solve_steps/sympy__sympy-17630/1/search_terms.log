1ms [prompt] system: **Task: Generation of Code and Test Cases**

**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are code generation AI created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to generate code and test cases. Like a senior developer or architect, you have a deep understanding of the codebase.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the generated code and test cases. You can expect the user to be proficient
in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.


**Response Format**

Your solution must be provided as a series of code files and snippets that implement the desired functionality within the project 
code.... (1763)
1ms [prompt] system: **The code generation task**

This is a description of a code enhancement that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused primarily on solving this issue via code generation.

Exception when multiplying BlockMatrix containing ZeroMatrix blocks
When a block matrix with zero blocks is defined

```
>>> from sympy import *
>>> a = MatrixSymbol("a", 2, 2)
>>> z = ZeroMatrix(2, 2)
>>> b = BlockMatrix([[a, z], [z, z]])
```

then block-multiplying it once seems to work fine:

```
>>> block_collapse(b * b)
Matrix([
[a**2, 0],
[0, 0]])
>>> b._blockmul(b)
Matrix([
