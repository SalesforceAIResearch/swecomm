**Title:** Fix AttributeError when BlockMatrix with Zero blocks is multiplied multiple times

**Problem:**
When a `BlockMatrix` contains `ZeroMatrix` blocks and is multiplied more than once, an exception is thrown due to encountering `Zero` objects instead of `ZeroMatrix`. This results in an `AttributeError` when the code tries to access the `cols` attribute of a `Zero` object.

**Analysis:**
The core of the issue arises from the way the multiplication of blocks within a `BlockMatrix` is handled. When a `BlockMatrix` with `ZeroMatrix` blocks is multiplied, the resultant zero blocks become `Zero` objects rather than retaining their `ZeroMatrix` type. This type inconsistency causes the `_blockmul` method to fail when it tries to access attributes specific to matrix objects.

The error traceback indicates that the issue occurs within the `_blockmul` method, where zero blocks are expected to have matrix attributes (like `cols`) but instead, they are found to be `Zero` objects. The crucial lines are in the `bc_matmul` function and the `_blockmul` method, specifically within the `colblocksizes` and `rowblocksizes` properties. 

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Update the `bc_matmul` function**:
    - Modify the method to ensure that zero blocks are correctly coerced into `ZeroMatrix` rather than defaulting to `Zero` objects after multiplications.

2. **Update the `_blockmul` method in `BlockMatrix`**:
    - Add checks to replace any resultant `Zero` objects with appropriate `ZeroMatrix` objects.

3. **Update the `colblocksizes` and `rowblocksizes` properties**:
    - Ensure that zero blocks are appropriately handled within these properties by checking for `Zero` and converting them to `ZeroMatrix`.

**Detailed Changes in `sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py`**:

1. **bc_matmul function**:
   - When popping elements from the `matrices` list, ensure any zero results are returned as `ZeroMatrix` rather than `Zero`.

2. **_blockmul method in `BlockMatrix` class**:
   - Add a check inside the `_blockmul` method to redefine any `Zero` objects back into `ZeroMatrix` with the correct dimensions.

3. **Property Methods Enhancements**:
   - Modify `colblocksizes` and `rowblocksizes` to handle `Zero` objects within the blocks, converting them as needed.

Here is a detailed explanation of what changes should be made and where:

**1. Modifying the `bc_matmul` function (line ~454):**
   - Ensure any zero results are returned as `ZeroMatrix`.

**2. Updating `_blockmul` method of `BlockMatrix` (line ~164):**
   - Add a check after multiplication results to ensure `Zero` objects are converted to `ZeroMatrix`.

**3. Enhancing Property Methods for Row and Column Block Sizes (line ~131 and ~307):**
   - Convert any `Zero` objects appropriately within the list comprehension in `colblocksizes` and `rowblocksizes`.

By ensuring that the zero blocks retain their `ZeroMatrix` type after operations, the multiplication will work correctly without throwing exceptions, thus fixing the encountered `AttributeError`.

With these changes, the handling of zero blocks in `BlockMatrix` would be consistent and robust, preventing the conversion to `Zero` objects which do not contain expected matrix attributes.

This plan ensures that the issue is tackled at multiple points where zero blocks are manipulated, thereby providing a comprehensive fix.
