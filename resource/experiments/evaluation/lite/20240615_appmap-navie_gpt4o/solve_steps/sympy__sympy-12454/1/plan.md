**Title**: Fix IndexError in `is_upper` for Tall Matrices

**Problem**: 
The function `Matrix.is_upper` raises an `IndexError` for matrices where the number of rows (`self.rows`) exceeds the number of columns (`self.cols`). This is because the function incorrectly tries to access elements that are out of the bounds of the matrix's column indices. Specifically, the problematic code within the `is_upper` method generates an iterable that includes indices that do not exist in matrices where `self.rows > self.cols`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is that when generating all the indices `(i, j)` to check for upper triangular properties, the code does not account for the possibility that `i` might exceed the number of columns. This leads to accessing an index that doesn't exist, resulting in an `IndexError`.

For a matrix to be upper triangular, any entry below the main diagonal (i.e., where `i > j`) must be zero. However, the current code does not properly ensure that the column index (`j`) remains within valid bounds.

**Proposed Changes**:
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `is_upper` method so that it only iterates over valid indices within the matrix dimensions. Specifically, `j` should only range from 0 up to `min(i, self.cols)`.

Here are the specific changes required:

1. **File**: `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`
   - **Function**: `is_upper`
   - **Modification**: Update the generator expression to only include valid indices for columns, ensuring `j` does not exceed `self.cols - 1`.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. Locate the `is_upper` method in `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`.
2. Modify the nested generator expression to validate column indices (`j`). Ensure `j` only ranges from `0` to `min(i, self.cols)`.

   - Before:
     

   - After:
     

This change ensures that the indices `(i, j)` are only generated for valid positions within the matrix dimensions, thus preventing the `IndexError`.

By implementing this fix, `is_upper` will correctly handle tall matrices without raising out-of-bounds errors.
