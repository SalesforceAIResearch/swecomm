**Title**: Fix IndexError in is_upper for tall matrices

**Problem**: 
The `Matrix.is_upper` function raises an `IndexError` for matrices where the number of rows exceeds the number of columns (tall matrices). This error occurs because the function generates indices that are out of range for the matrix dimensions.

**Analysis**:
The `is_upper` function checks whether a matrix is upper triangular by verifying if all elements below the main diagonal are zero. The function iterates over elements using nested loops:


For tall matrices, such as a 4x2 matrix, the inner loop generates indices that exceed the number of columns, leading to an attempt to access an invalid index in the matrix, causing an `IndexError`.

For example, for a 4x2 matrix:
- `i` runs from `1` to `3` (since `self.rows` is `4`).
- When `i = 3`, `j` runs from `0` to `2` (since `i = 3`), causing an invalid access at index `[3, 2]`.

**Proposed Changes**:
To fix this issue, the inner loop should account for the actual number of columns in the matrix, ensuring `j` does not exceed the number of columns (`self.cols`). Update the nested loops in the `is_upper` function to handle this condition.

1. Locate the `is_upper` function definition.
2. Modify the nested loops to constrain `j` within the matrix columns.

Update the code to:


In this updated code:
- The `min(i, self.cols)` ensures that `j` never exceeds the number of columns in the matrix, thus preventing the `IndexError`.

This change will ensure that the function operates correctly for all matrix dimensions, including tall matrices.

The changes ensure that the function only checks valid indices, eliminating the potential for accessing out-of-range indices.
