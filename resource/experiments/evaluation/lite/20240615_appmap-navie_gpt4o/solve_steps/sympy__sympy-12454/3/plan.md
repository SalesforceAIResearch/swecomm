**Title**: Fix IndexError in `is_upper()` for Tall Matrices

**Problem**: 
The `is_upper` function in the `Matrix` class raises an `IndexError` when called on a tall matrix (e.g., 4 rows and 2 columns). The error occurs because the function attempts to access an index that is out-of-bounds for non-square matrices.

**Analysis**: 
The root of the problem lies in the nested iteration within the `is_upper` function:

For a non-square matrix, this pattern attempts to access elements where the column index exceeds the number of columns in the matrix, causing an `IndexError`.

To avoid this, we need to ensure that the column index `j` does not exceed the valid column index range (`0` to `self.cols - 1`). 

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **MatrixBase Class (`matrices.py`)**:
    - Modify the `is_upper()` method to include a check ensuring that the column index `j` is within bounds (`j < self.cols`).

Below are the detailed steps and file modifications required:

1. **Modify the `is_upper` Method in `matrices.py`**:
    - Add a condition to ensure the index `j` is within the valid range.

**File Modifications**:

1. **File**: `sympy/matrices/matrices.py`
    - **Function**: `is_upper`
    - **Modification**:
        - Update the loop to include a check that `j` is less than `self.cols` before accessing the matrix element.

        Update the `is_upper` method as follows:
        

This modification ensures that `is_upper` will only access valid indices for both square and non-square matrices, thus preventing the `IndexError`.

By implementing the above change, the function will no longer attempt to access out-of-bound indices for tall matrices, thus resolving the issue effectively.
