**Title**: Remove 'for' Attribute from Label in ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget Widget

**Problem**: In the admin interface, the label element for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` widget incorrectly has a 'for' attribute pointing to a non-labelable element. The widget only displays text and does not have any input elements. Therefore, the label should not have a 'for' attribute.

**Analysis**: The `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` widget is used in the admin interface to display a hashed password in a read-only format. Since this widget is only for display purposes and does not interact with any form inputs, the label associated with it should not seek to link to a non-existent input via a 'for' attribute. HTML specifications dictate that the 'for' attribute should only reference labelable elements, such as inputs, textareas, or select boxes. By incorrectly using the 'for' attribute, the HTML becomes invalid, which could lead to unexpected behavior or accessibility issues.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Django Admin Form Widget File**:
    - Identify the location where the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` is defined and used.
    - Modify the rendering logic of the label associated with the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` to exclude the 'for' attribute.

The file likely contains the definition and rendering logic for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget` in the Django admin forms. Since this modification is isolated to the widget itself, other parts of the codebase should not require any changes.

Specific changes include:

- Locate the relevant method that dictates how the label is rendered for the `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`.
- Update this method to ensure that when the widget is of type `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`, the `for` attribute is not included in the label tag.

Proposed file changes:

**File**: `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` (or similar, based on your project structure)

- **Function**: Method responsible for rendering the widgetâ€™s label
- **Modification**:
  - Check if the widget is an instance of `ReadOnlyPasswordHashWidget`.
  - If true, render the label without the 'for' attribute.

By following these steps, the label will render appropriately without the 'for' attribute, adhering to HTML specifications and improving the overall robustness and accessibility of your admin interface.
