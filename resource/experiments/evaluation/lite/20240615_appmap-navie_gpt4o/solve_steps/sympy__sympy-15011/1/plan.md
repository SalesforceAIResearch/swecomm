**Title: Fix SyntaxError in lambdify with MatrixSymbol names containing curly braces and dummify=True**

**Problem**: 
`lambdify` encounters a `SyntaxError` when working with `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces, even when `dummify` is set to `True`.

**Analysis**:
The issue occurs due to the way `lambdify` handles symbol names containing curly braces when converting them to valid Python identifiers. Even when `dummify=True`, which is supposed to replace symbols with dummy symbols to avoid syntax issues, the presence of curly braces in `MatrixSymbol` names is not handled correctly.

1. **Current Behavior**:
    - `lambdify` works with simple symbols containing curly braces and with `MatrixSymbol` without curly braces.
    - However, it fails when both conditions (curly braces and `MatrixSymbol`) are present together.

2. **Underlying Cause**:
    - The `lambdify` function does not effectively sanitize `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces, even under `dummify=True`.
    - The `_preprocess` method, which is responsible for preprocessing arguments and replacing invalid identifiers, needs to be improved to handle this specific edge case.

3. **Effect of the Bug**:
    - Users are unable to create lambda functions for `MatrixSymbol` objects with curly braces in their names.
    - This restricts certain kinds of symbolic expressions from being evaluated or simplified using `lambdify`.

4. **Expected Behavior**:
    - `lambdify` should successfully preprocess `MatrixSymbol` names containing curly braces and generate appropriate dummy symbols to avoid syntax issues, allowing the lambda function to be created without errors.

**Proposed Changes**:
Focus on updating the `lambdify` implementation in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` to properly handle `MatrixSymbol` names with curly braces.

1. **File**: `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`
    - **Function**: `_preprocess(self, args, expr)`
        - Modify the preprocessing logic to better handle symbols with invalid Python identifiers, such as curly braces, especially within `MatrixSymbol` names.
        - Ensure that dummy symbols are generated correctly and replace any problematic identifiers before constructing the lambda function strings.
    
    - **Function**: `lambdify(args, expr, modules=None, printer=None, use_imps=True, dummify=False)`
        - Update the main `lambdify` function to ensure that the preprocessing step handles the aforementioned edge case.

2. **Detailed Steps**:
    - In the `_preprocess` method, check each symbol within `MatrixSymbol` names for curly braces.
    - If `dummify=True`, ensure that these symbols are replaced with dummy symbols that are valid Python identifiers.
    - Append these dummy replacements to a dictionary for subsequent replacement in both arguments and expressions.

By addressing these steps, `lambdify` should handle `MatrixSymbol` names with curly braces correctly and avoid the `SyntaxError`.

**Summary**:
The fix involves enhancing the preprocessing logic to better sanitize symbol names, especially those within `MatrixSymbol`, ensuring that they are valid Python identifiers. This will allow `lambdify` to work seamlessly even with symbols containing curly braces when `dummify=True`.
