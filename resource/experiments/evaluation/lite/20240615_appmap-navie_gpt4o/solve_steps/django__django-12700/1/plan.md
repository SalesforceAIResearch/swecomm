**Title**: Enhance `cleanse_setting` to Recursively Process All Iterables for Sensitive Data

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter.cleanse_setting` method only handles `dict` objects and returns other types of iterables without cleansing them. This results in sensitive information not being properly redacted in nested iterables like lists or tuples. 

**Analysis**:
1. **Current Logic**:
   - `cleanse_setting` checks if the value associated with a setting key is a dictionary and then recursively processes dictionary elements.
   - If the value is not a dictionary, it directly returns the value.

2. **Issues**:
   - The logic doesn't account for other iterable types such as lists or tuples, which may contain sensitive data nested within them.
   - As a result, sensitive information within these iterables remains unredacted.

3. **Proposed Enhancements**:
   - Extend the `cleanse_setting` method to handle all iterable types, including lists, tuples, and sets.
   - Recursively cleanse any nested dictionaries or iterable elements.
   - Maintain the confidentiality of sensitive data across nested structures.

**Proposed Changes**:

- **File to be Modified**: `django/views/debug.py`

1. **Update `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` Class**:
   - Modify the `cleanse_setting` method to recognize and handle all iterable types (e.g., list, tuple, set).
   - Implement recursive cleansing of nested dictionaries and iterable elements.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:

1. **In `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class**:
   - Identify if the value is an instance of a list, tuple, or set.
   - Apply cleansing recursively to these types by iterating over the elements and applying `cleanse_setting`.

2. **Method: `cleanse_setting`**:
   - After checking if `value` is a dictionary, add a check for other iterables (list, tuple, set).
   - Use a comprehension to cleanse each element recursively if `value` is found to be an iterable.
   - Return the cleansed value after processing the nested structures.

By making these modifications, sensitive information within nested iterables will be properly redacted, improving overall security and consistency in how settings are cleansed.

**Example Modification** (Conceptual Summary without Code):
- Within `cleanse_setting` method:
  1. Add checks for `isinstance(value, (list, tuple, set))`.
  2. For lists and tuples, use a comprehension to apply `cleanse_setting` recursively to each element.
  3. For sets, convert to a list to cleanse, and then back to a set.
  4. Ensure the final cleansed structure retains the original type (e.g., list, tuple, set).

By addressing all iterable types, the method will ensure comprehensive cleansing of any sensitive data, regardless of its nesting structure.
