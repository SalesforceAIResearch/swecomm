Based on the issue description, the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter.cleanse_setting` method needs to be enhanced to handle nested iterables (lists, tuples, sets) and cleanse their elements recursively. Below are the necessary changes to achieve this:

### Changes

1. **Extend `cleanse_setting`**: Update the method to handle lists, tuples, and sets by iterating through their elements and applying the `cleanse_setting` method recursively.

        elif isinstance(value, list):
            cleansed = [self.cleanse_setting(key, v) for v in value]
        elif isinstance(value, tuple):
            cleansed = tuple(self.cleanse_setting(key, v) for v in value)
        elif isinstance(value, set):
            cleansed = {self.cleanse_setting(key, v) for v in value}

    return cleansed

```

This modification ensures that lists, tuples, and sets are processed recursively, cleansing any sensitive data within nested structures. The changes handle the cleansing in a way that maintains the original data structure type, replacing sensitive elements with `self.cleansed_substitute` where appropriate.
