**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Settings are cleaned insufficiently.
Description
	
Posting publicly after checking with the rest of the security team.
I just ran into a case where django.views.debug.SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings() would return several un-cleansed values. Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we ​only take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but ​return them as-is.
Example:
In my settings.py I have this:
MY_SETTING = {
	"foo": "value",
	"secret": "value",
	"token": "value",
	"something": [
		{"foo": "value"},
		{"secret": "value"},
		{"token": "value"},
	],
	"else": [
		[
			{"foo": "value"},
			{"secret": "value"},
			{"token": "value"},
		],
		[
			{"foo": "value"},
			{"secret": "value"},
			{"token": "value"},
		],
	]
}
