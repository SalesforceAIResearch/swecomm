### Fix Handling of Empty Submissions in ModelMultipleChoiceField with Union Query

**Problem**
When using `union()` in the queryset for a `ModelMultipleChoiceField` in a Django form, submitting the form with an empty selection results in all objects matching the query being added. This behavior is unintended and differs from using `OR`, where no objects are added if the form is submitted without selections.

**Analysis**
The observed issue arises because the `union()` method creates a combined query that, when evaluated in the form submission, includes unintended results when the form is submitted with no selections. The `OR` query (`|`) correctly does not add any objects when the form is empty, aligning with the expected behavior.

The primary reason for this discrepancy is that the `union()` operation may result in a queryset object that does not handle `empty` input submissions as expected. To handle this, we need to manually ensure that an empty submission results in no objects being added.

**Proposed Changes**
To address this issue, we need to modify the form's `cleaned_data` during the form cleaning process to ensure that no objects are added when the form is submitted with an empty selection.

We'll modify the `clean_publications` method in `ArticleForm` to check for an empty selection and reset the queryset accordingly.

**Changes in File: `django/contrib/flatpages/forms.py`**

1. **Add a `clean_publications` method in the `ArticleForm` class**:
   - Check if `publications` is empty in `cleaned_data`.
   - If empty, reset the `cleaned_data['publications']` to an empty queryset.



2. **Ensure that the new method integrates seamlessly into the form validation process**:
   - Utilize the `clean_` prefix which Django forms use to process validation and cleaning for individual fields.

**Summary**
By adding a custom `clean_publications` method to handle empty form submissions correctly, we ensure that the use of `union()` in the queryset does not inadvertently add all objects when no selections are made in the form.

Following these changes will align the behavior of `union()` more closely with the `OR` query and prevent the addition of unintended objects upon empty submissions.
