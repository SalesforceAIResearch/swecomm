### Title
Fix get_FOO_display to correctly handle inherited choices in Django models

### Problem
The `get_FOO_display` method does not work correctly with inherited choices in Django models. When a child model inherits from a base model and overrides the choices field, any new tuples added to the choices field do not return the expected display value. Instead, the method returns the key itself for the new tuples.

### Analysis
The root cause of the issue lies in the method that constructs the choices map for the `get_FOO_display` method. When a child model overrides the choices defined in the parent model, the overridden choices list is stored at the child model, but the mapping function utilized by `get_FOO_display` might not be refreshed appropriately to include the new tuples.

- **Expected Behavior**: When `get_FOO_display` is called on a field of a child model, it should use the overridden choices list to map the values to display names.
- **Current Behavior**: The overridden list is not entirely respected, causing the new tuples not to map correctly, leading to key values being returned instead of their corresponding display values.

### Proposed Changes
The changes should focus on ensuring that the complete set of choices, including those added in the child model, are used to map field values to their display strings.

1. **File to Modify**: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`
    - **Class**: CharField (or more generally, any class inheriting from Field that utilizes choices)
    - **Method**: This file should contain methods for managing field choices and display mappings. We need to ensure that the `choices` property correctly accumulates all the available choices, including those defined in subclasses.
    
    **Detailed Change Description**:
    - Ensure that the `__get__` method for the `choices` attribute accumulates choices from both the parent and the child classes.
    - When calling `get_FOO_display`, ensure that the field choices are being fetched and processed correctly from the instance's class definition, ensuring inheritance is respected.

### Specific Code Updates:
- **django/db/models/fields/__init__.py**:
    - Locate the method that handles the initialization of choices when constructing the model field.
    - Ensure that when initializing or fetching the choices for a field, choices from parent classes and the currently instantiated class are both taken into consideration.
    - Specifically, the method that maps field values to their respective display values (`get_FOO_display` mechanism) should ensure it checks the accumulated choices correctly.

    This change ensures that the `choices` property respects inheritance and that the `get_FOO_display` method uses the correct map of keys to display values.

Remember, do not modify test case files directly. After implementing the changes, appropriate tests should be conducted to ensure the changes are effective and do not introduce new issues.
