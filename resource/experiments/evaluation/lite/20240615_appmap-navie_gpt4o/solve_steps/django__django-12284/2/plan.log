**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Model.get_FOO_display() does not work correctly with inherited choices.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
Given a base model with choices A containing 3 tuples
Child Model inherits the base model overrides the choices A and adds 2 more tuples
get_foo_display does not work correctly for the new tuples added
Example:
class A(models.Model):
 foo_choice = [("A","output1"),("B","output2")]
 field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254,choices=foo_choice)
 class Meta:
	 abstract = True
class B(A):
 foo_choice = [("A","output1"),("B","output2"),("C","output3")]
 field_foo = models.CharField(max_length=254,choices=foo_choice)
Upon invoking get_field_foo_display() on instance of B , 
For value "A" and "B" the output works correctly i.e. returns "output1" /... (922)
