**Title**: Fix Model.get_FOO_display() to work correctly with inherited choices

**Problem**: 
The `get_FOO_display()` method does not return the correct display value for overridden choices in inherited models. While base class choices are handled correctly, extended choices in the child class return the original value instead of the expected display string.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because Django's method resolution order and attribute lookup mechanism prioritize attributes defined on the class itself over those from the base class. When the choices attribute is overridden in the child class, the new choices list does not get correctly utilized by the `get_FOO_display()` method.

To fix this, we should ensure that the `get_FOO_display()` method correctly uses the choices from the instance's class, allowing it to handle overrides and extensions made to choices in inherited models.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`

   Modify the `get_FOO_display()` method to retrieve choices in a way that respects overridden attributes in inherited models.

    - Locate the method implementation of `get_FOO_display(`
	- Modify it to dynamically retrieve the choices based on the instance's class rather than relying on potentially inherited attributes from the base class.

2. **File**: `django/db/models/enums.py`

   Ensure that the method dealing with choices is able to handle cases where the choices are extended in child classes. This may involve tweaking the `Choices` class or related utility functions.

Each of these changes should be minimal and targeted to only affect the faulty behavior while preserving the original functionality.

1. Update `get_FOO_display` method to respect overridden `choices`:
   
   
   
2. Ensure the `Choices` class handles extended choices properly:
   
   

Make sure to replace placeholders such as `FIELD_NAME` and `FIELD_NAME_CHOICES` with the actual field names relevant to your models.

By following these adjustments, the `get_FOO_display()` method should correctly respect and display extended choices in inherited models.
