**Title:** Update URL resolver behavior to accommodate optional URL parameters in Django 3.0

**Problem:**
Optional URL parameters crash some view functions. The URL routes with optional parameters that didn't cause issues in Django 2.2 are now throwing a TypeError in Django 3.0. The `modules` view function, which accepts `format` as an optional parameter, is receiving more positional arguments than expected due to changes in the `_get_response` processing.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue originates from changes in how Django 3.0 processes URL patterns and invokes view functions. Specifically, the URL resolver is passing arguments in a manner that conflicts with the view function signature when optional parameters are involved. Before Django 3.0, if an optional URL parameter was not present, Django didn't include it in the list of positional arguments to the view, thereby preventing the TypeError. 

In the current setup within `django/core/handlers/base.py`, the resolver calls the view with unexpected arguments which causes the function signature mismatch.

**Proposed Changes:**
Focus will be given to the file `django/core/handlers/base.py` to modify the `_resolve_request` function's behavior so that optional URL parameters are handled correctly.

1. **File:** `django/core/handlers/base.py`
   - **Location:** `_get_response` function (Lines 71-91)
   - **Change Required:** Modify the logic that retrieves arguments and keyword arguments from the resolver match to ensure optional parameters are handled without causing positional argument mismatches.

   Detailed Description:
     - The `resolver.resolve(request.path_info)` method call returns a `ResolverMatch` object. Inspect and adjust how `callback_args` and `callback_kwargs` are populated from the match.
     - Ensure that if an optional parameter is missing, it defaults to a keyword argument rather than causing a positional mismatch.

Steps:
1. **Inspect _get_response logic:**
   - Modify how arguments are extracted from the `resolver_match`:
     

2. **Check response behavior:**
   - Ensure the middleware and template response logics remain intact and respond correctly.

By ensuring optional URL parameters are transformed correctly, we can avoid the mismatch of positional arguments seen in Django 3.0. This fix should accommodate the expected behavior in the `modules` view and others like it across the project.
