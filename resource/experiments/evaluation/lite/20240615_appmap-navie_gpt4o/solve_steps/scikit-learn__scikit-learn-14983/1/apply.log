class RepeatedStratifiedKFold(_RepeatedSplits):
    """Repeated Stratified K-Fold cross validator.

    Repeats Stratified K-Fold n times with different randomization in each
    repetition.

    Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <cross_validation>`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_splits : int, default=5
        Number of folds. Must be at least 2.

    n_repeats : int, default=10
        Number of times cross-validator needs to be repeated.

    random_state : None, int or RandomState, default=None
        Random state to be used to generate random state for each
        repetition.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedStratifiedKFold
    >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4], [1, 2], [3, 4]])

    Randomized CV splitters may return different results for each call of
    split. You can make the results identical by setting ``random_state``
    to an integer.
