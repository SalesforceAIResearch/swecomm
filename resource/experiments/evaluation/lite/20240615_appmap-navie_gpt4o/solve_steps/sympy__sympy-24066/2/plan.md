**Title**: Fix dimensionless exponent detection in `_collect_factor_and_dimension()`

**Problem**:

The `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` function in `UnitSystem` fails to properly detect and handle dimensionless exponents, resulting in a `ValueError`. Specifically, it does not correctly identify scenarios where the exponent should be treated as dimensionless within compound expressions involving mathematical functions like `exp()`.

**Analysis**:

The root cause of the issue seems to be an incorrect handling of the dimensional analysis of exponents within compound expressions. The function `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` within `UnitSystem` needs to be updated to correctly identify and treat dimensionless exponents. The current code fails to do so, leading to an inconsistency where an exponent expected to be dimensionless throws an error when it is not appropriately handled.

The following changes should be implemented in `unitsystem.py`:
1. Verify that exponents are checked for dimensionlessness correctly.
2. Update the logic to correctly handle dimensionless exponents in mathematical functions like `exp()`.
3. Ensure that the dimension of `Dimension(1)` is used for dimensionless exponents within compound expressions.

**Proposed Changes**:

File: `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`

1. Modify `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` to correctly handle dimensionless exponents:

    - Within the `Pow` case, after calculating `exp_factor` and `exp_dim`, ensure that `exp_dim` is validated properly as dimensionless.
    - Update the handling of mathematical functions like `exp()` to use correct logic for dimensionless exponents.

    Consider the following modifications within the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method:

    

2. Ensure that any other mathematical functions that involve exponents (such as `exp()`) handle dimensionless checks in a similar manner.

These changes will ensure that `_collect_factor_and_dimension` correctly identifies dimensionless exponents and prevents incorrect dimensional assertions, thus resolving the observed issue without introducing regressions.
