**Title**: Fix SI._collect_factor_and_dimension() to Properly Detect Dimensionless Exponents

**Problem**: 
The method `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` in SymPy cannot correctly identify that an exponent is dimensionless in certain expressions. This causes incorrect dimension detection, resulting in a `ValueError` when the method is used in mathematical expressions involving dimensionless units.

**Analysis**:
1. **Root Cause**: The method `_collect_factor_and_dimension()` currently fails to properly simplify and recognize dimensionless units in some compound expressions involving exponents (`exp()`). The primary issue lies in the handling of the exponent in the `Pow` and `Function` cases. Specifically, the method isn't adequately verifying if the exponent is dimensionless.
2. **Effect**: When the dimension of an expression should be dimensionless but is detected as having dimensions (such as in the case of the exponential function with a dimensionless exponent), a `ValueError` is raised, obstructing the computation.
3. **Logic Change**: To fix this, `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension()` must include additional checks to determine if the exponent is a dimensionless quantity. Specifically, the method should check if the dimension is recognized as dimensionless by the system and handle it accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**:
*File to Modify*: `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`

1. **Modify `_collect_factor_and_dimension` Method** (`sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`):
   - In the `Pow` case, after calculating `exp_factor` and `exp_dim` for the exponent, ensure that `exp_dim` is verified with `is_dimensionless` to handle dimensionless exponents correctly.
   - Adjust the `Function` case to handle functions like `exp` which should be dimensionless.

**Detailed Changes**:
1. **Handling Pow Cases**:
   - Ensure that after obtaining `exp_dim`, it is checked using `is_dimensionless`.
   - This ensures exponents expected to be dimensionless are correctly identified, preventing the erroneous multiplication of dimensional objects.

2. **Handling Function Cases**:
   - Specifically handle functions like `exp` directly after collecting factors and dimensions of their arguments.
   - Ensure that if all arguments to the function are identified as dimensionless, the result itself is marked as dimensionless.

Here is a high-level description of the changes necessary in the `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py` file:

*sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py:*

- **Inside `_collect_factor_and_dimension` Method**:
  - **Pow Handling**:
     - Check if `exp_dim` is dimensionless before further computation.
     - Adjust the return for dimensionless exponents.
  - **Function Handling**:
     - Aggregate dimensional checks for the arguments of the functions like `exp`.
     - Mark the returned dimension as `Dimension(1)` if all arguments are dimensionless.

By making these changes, `SI._collect_factor_and_dimension` will correctly handle dimensionless exponents, thus avoiding the `ValueError` when it encounters expressions that should be dimensionless.
