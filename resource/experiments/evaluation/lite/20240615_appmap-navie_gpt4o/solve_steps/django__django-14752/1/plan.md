**Title**: Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to Support Customizable Autocomplete Response Fields

**Problem**:
Currently, adding new attributes to autocomplete field results requires fully overriding the `AutocompleteJsonView.get()` method. This leads to high maintenance overhead as changes to the base method necessitate updates to the custom implementations. 

**Analysis**:
The core issue arises because there is no easy way to extend the data structure of the autocomplete results. The current implementation of `AutocompleteJsonView.get()` directly constructs the JSON response with no extension points for customizing the data attributes per object. As a result, developers have to override the entire method to add custom fields, which becomes problematic as the base method evolves over time.

To solve this problem, an extension point should be provided by moving the result construction into a separate method, allowing subclasses to easily extend or modify the result structure.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `AutocompleteJsonView` in the `django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py` to introduce a new method, `serialize_result`, which is responsible for converting each object to a dictionary suitable for JSON serialization.

1. **In the `autocomplete.py` file:**

    - **Add/Modify Method in `AutocompleteJsonView` Class**:
        - Add a new `serialize_result` method.
        - Refactor the `get` method to use `serialize_result` for constructing the response data.

    **New Method**:
    - `serialize_result` should accept an object and the `to_field_name`, returning a dictionary with the ID and text.

    **Refactored Method**:
    - Update the `get` method to call `serialize_result` for each object in the context.

2. **Snippet Location**: `django/contrib/admin/views/autocomplete.py`

    - **Refactor `get` Method**:
        

    - **Add `serialize_result` Method**:
        

These changes will allow developers to extend the `AutocompleteJsonView` class and easily add or modify the fields in the autocomplete responses without overriding the entire `get` method, reducing maintenance effort and improving code manageability.
