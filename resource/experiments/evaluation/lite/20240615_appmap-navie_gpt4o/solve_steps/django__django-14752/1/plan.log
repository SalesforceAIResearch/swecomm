according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

Refactor AutocompleteJsonView to support extra fields in autocomplete response
Description
	 
		(last modified by mrts)
	 
Adding data attributes to items in ordinary non-autocomplete foreign key fields that use forms.widgets.Select-based widgets is relatively easy. This enables powerful and dynamic admin site customizations where fields from related models are updated immediately when users change the selected item.

class MyModelAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):
	def get_urls(self):
		return [
