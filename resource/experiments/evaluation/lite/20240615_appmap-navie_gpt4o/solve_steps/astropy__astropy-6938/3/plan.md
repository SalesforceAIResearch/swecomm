**Title**: Rectify floating-point exponent replacement in `fitsrec.py` to handle non-in-place operation

**Problem**: 
The current implementation in `fitsrec.py` replaces the exponent separator 'D' with 'E' in floating point numbers by calling `output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))`. However, `replace` is not an in-place operation for `chararray`, meaning the original `output_field` remains unmodified. This code might not be functioning as intended, and the lack of test failures when commenting out this code suggests that it's not covered by tests.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the bug is the misunderstanding of how the `replace` method works on `chararray`. It does not modify the `chararray` in place but rather returns a new `chararray` with the replacements. Therefore, modifying `output_field` directly is necessary to achieve the desired behavior.

To address this issue, the result of `replace` should be reassigned back to `output_field`. Additionally, since no existing tests fail when this code is commented out, this segment is likely uncovered by tests. It would be prudent to follow up by ensuring that related test cases exercise this path to avoid regression.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Identify the function handling the replacement operation.
2. Modify the code to reassign the result of `replace` back to the `output_field`.
3. Ensure the proper encoding and decoding are maintained.

  Specifically:
  - Locate the part in `fitsrec.py` where the exponent replacement takes place.
  - Modify the line `output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))` to `output_field = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))`.

**Required Code Modifications**:

*File to Modify*: `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py`

*Details of Changes*:

1. Locate the relevant function in `fitsrec.py` containing the exponent replacement logic.
2. Update the non-in-place `replace` operation to store the result back in `output_field`.



Implement these changes to ensure that `output_field` correctly reflects the modified data. After the modifications, consider updating or adding test cases to verify that this part of the code functions as expected and remains covered by the test suite.
