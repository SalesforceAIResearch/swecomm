**Title**: Fix `replace` usage to handle non-in-place operation in `fitsrec.py`

**Problem**:
In the `fitsrec.py`, there is a potential bug where the `replace` method is used on `output_field` to substitute 'E' with 'D' in floating point numbers in the FITS file. However, `replace` is not an in-place operation for `chararray`, leading to the modification potentially not being applied. Additionally, this part of the code does not appear to be tested, as commenting it out does not cause any test failures.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem is that `replace` on a `chararray` does not modify the array in place but instead returns a new object with the replacements. Without assigning the result back to `output_field`, the replacement will not take effect. This is a common issue when working with immutable sequence types in Python.

To address this issue:
1. Ensure that the result of the `replace` operation is assigned back to `output_field`.
2. Identify why this part of the code is not covered by tests and ensure adequate test coverage if necessary.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `astropy/io/fits/fitseq.py`

   Modify the code block related to replacing exponent separators in floating point numbers to:
   - Assign the result of the `replace` method back to `output_field`.

   Update the code as follows:
   - Locate the code block around the given context and ensure `output_field` is correctly updated.

   **Changes**:
   

By addressing the root cause and ensuring the `replace` function's result is reassigned correctly, we will resolve the potential bug, making the code function as intended.
