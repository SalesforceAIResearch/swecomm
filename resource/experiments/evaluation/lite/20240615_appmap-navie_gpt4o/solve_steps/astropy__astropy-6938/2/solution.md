Let's address the issue described. The problem involves an incorrect usage of the `replace` method on a `chararray` in the `fitsrec.py` file. The `replace` method returns a new array and does not modify the array in place. This behavior was not initially accounted for, leading to potential errors in the FITS file handling.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the output of the `replace` method is assigned back to the variable so that the changes are not lost.
Here's the specific change required:

```python
output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
```
should be modified to
```python
output_field = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
```

Here's the code change encapsulated in the required format:

```xml
<change>
  <file change-number-for-this-file="1">astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py</file>
  <original line-count="14" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
]]></original>
  <modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
        # Replace exponent separator in floating point numbers
        if 'D' in format:
            output_field = output_field.replace(encode_ascii('E'), encode_ascii('D'))
]]></modified>
</change>
```

With this change, we ensure that `output_field` gets updated correctly with the replaced values.

### Additional Test Case
An additional test case should be written to ensure this new code path behaves as expected. Hereâ€™s an example test case that would verify this:

#### New Test Case in Existing Test Suite

Here, we assume that there is a test file named `test_fitsrec.py` in the `astropy/io/fits/tests` directory.

```python
<file>
<path>astropy/io/fits/tests/test_fitsrec.py</path>
<content><![CDATA[
import numpy as np
from astropy.io.fits.fitsrec import FITS_rec
from numpy import char as chararray

def test_exponent_replacement():
    # Create a sample data array with a floating-point value in the form with 'E' exponent
    data = np.array(['1.23E+05'], dtype='S10')
    data = data.view(chararray.chararray)
    
    # Format with 'D'
    format_str = 'D10.4'

    # Create FITS_rec instance
    rec = FITS_rec(data)
    
    # Perform scale back which includes exponent replacement
    rec._scale_back_strings(0, data, data)

    # Check if 'E' has been replaced with 'D'
    assert np.all(rec.field(0) == np.array(['1.23D+05'], dtype='S10'))

]]></content>
</file>
```

### Conclusion
The modification ensures that the `replace` method's result is used correctly. The additional test case verifies that the exponent replacement behaves as expected. Please integrate the change and the new test case to maintain the integrity of the codebase and catch any edge cases pertaining to this issue.
