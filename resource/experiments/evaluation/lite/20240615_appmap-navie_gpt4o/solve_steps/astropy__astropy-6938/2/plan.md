**Title**: Fix incorrect usage of `replace` method on `chararray` in FITS file handling

**Problem**: 
In `fitsrec.py`, there is a potential bug in how the `replace` method is utilized on a `chararray`. The current implementation incorrectly assumes that `replace` is an in-place operation when working with `chararray`, whereas `replace` actually returns a new array. This could lead to unexpected behavior or data being incorrectly processed.

**Analysis**:
The code snippet in question is found in `fitsrec.py` and involves replacing the 'D' exponent separator with 'E' in floating-point numbers for FITS (Flexible Image Transport System) format standards. The problematic line:

does not modify `output_field` in place but rather returns a new modified array. If the returned value is not used, the `output_field` remains unchanged. This could potentially lead to incorrect exponent separators in the FITS files handled by the library.

To resolve this, instead of calling `replace` without utilizing its return value, the code should reassign the result back to `output_field`, ensuring the intended modification is applied.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Identify the exact location of the `fitsrec.py` file and the line where the `replace` operation is attempted.
2. Modify the `replace` line to capture its return value and reassign it to `output_field`.

**File to be changed**:
- `astropy/io/fits/fitsrec.py`

**Suggested modification**:
Locate the section in `fitsrec.py` where the `replace` operation is applied. Update the code as follows:
- Change the line from:
  
  to:
  

This change ensures that the `output_field` array is properly updated with 'E' replaced by 'D' for the exponent separators in the `chararray`.

Make sure to thoroughly test this change, even if existing tests did not fail previously. Consider adding additional tests if necessary to cover this functionality.
