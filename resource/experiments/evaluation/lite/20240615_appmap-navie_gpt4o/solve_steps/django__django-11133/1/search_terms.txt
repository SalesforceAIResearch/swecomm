HttpResponse doesn't handle memoryview objects
Description
	
I am trying to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:
from django.http import HttpResponse																	 
# String content
response = HttpResponse("My Content")																			
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is correct
# Bytes content
response = HttpResponse(b"My Content")																		 
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is also correct
# memoryview content
response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))															 
response.content
# Out: b'<memory at 0x7fcc47ab2648>'
# This is not correct, I am expecting b'My Content'

</issue>
