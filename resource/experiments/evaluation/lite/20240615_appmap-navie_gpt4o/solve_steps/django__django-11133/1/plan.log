**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

HttpResponse doesn't handle memoryview objects
Description
	
I am trying to write a BinaryField retrieved from the database into a HttpResponse. When the database is Sqlite this works correctly, but Postgresql returns the contents of the field as a memoryview object and it seems like current Django doesn't like this combination:
from django.http import HttpResponse																	 
# String content
response = HttpResponse("My Content")																			
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is correct
# Bytes content
response = HttpResponse(b"My Content")																		 
response.content																								 
# Out: b'My Content'
# This is also correct
# memoryview content
response = HttpResponse(memoryview(b"My Content"))						... (937)
