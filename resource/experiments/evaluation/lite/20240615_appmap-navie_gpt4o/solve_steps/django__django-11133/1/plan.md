**Title**: Add memoryview support in HttpResponse content handling

**Problem**: The `HttpResponse` class in Django currently does not handle `memoryview` objects correctly. When content is set using a `memoryview` object, the `content` property returns a string representation of the `memoryview` object rather than the actual bytes content it represents.

**Analysis**: In Django, the `HttpResponse` class expects the content to be in a string or bytes format. When a `memoryview` object (which provides a way to view the memory of other binary objects without copying) is assigned to the `content` property, it is not automatically converted to bytes, leading to incorrect output.

The solution involves modifying the `content` property setter of the `HttpResponse` class to recognize `memoryview` objects and convert them to bytes before assigning to the internal content container.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/http/response.py`
   
   **Function to change**: `HttpResponse.content` property setter. Modify it to convert `memoryview` objects to bytes before they are appended to the `_container`.

   **Modification details**:
   
   - Update the content setter to recognize `memoryview` instances.
   - Convert `memoryview` instances to bytes before appending to `_container`.

**Detailed Steps**:

1. Open the `django/http/response.py` file.
2. Locate the `content` property setter within the `HttpResponse` class (around line 344-370).
3. Modify the setter to include a check for `memoryview` and convert it to bytes.

**Example Implementation**:

Assume the content setter starts like this:


Modify the content setter as follows:
1. Check if `value` is an instance of `memoryview`.
2. If it is, convert it to bytes using `bytes(value)`.

Updated content setter:


After these changes, ensure that the setter correctly handles `memoryview` and converts them to bytes to maintain consistency in the `HttpResponse` content handling.
