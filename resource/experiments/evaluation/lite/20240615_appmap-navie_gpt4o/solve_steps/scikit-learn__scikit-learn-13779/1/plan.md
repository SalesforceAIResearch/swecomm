**Title**: Fix `VotingClassifier.fit` failure when `None` estimator is provided with `sample_weight`

**Problem**: 
The `VotingClassifier` fails during the `fit` process when an estimator is set to `None` and `sample_weight` is provided. This happens because there is no check to handle `None` estimators when using `sample_weight`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

**Analysis**:
In the `VotingClassifier.fit` method, the current implementation iterates through all provided estimators to fit them. If one of the estimators is `None` and `sample_weight` is provided, the code attempts to call the `fit` method on `NoneType`, which results in an `AttributeError`. 

To resolve this, we need to add a check to bypass `None` estimators when fitting and especially when dealing with `sample_weight`.

Hereâ€™s a detailed analysis of the necessary logic changes:
1. During the fitting process in `VotingClassifier.fit`, ensure that each estimator is checked for `None` before calling its `fit` method.
2. If an estimator is `None`, skip the fitting process for that particular estimator.
3. Ensure that the `sample_weight` logic is also adjusted to handle cases where some estimators might be `None`.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `VotingClassifier.fit` function in the `sklearn/ensemble/_voting.py` file as follows:

1. **Location**: `sklearn/ensemble/_voting.py`
   - **Function**: `fit`
     - In the loop where each estimator's `fit` method is called, add a check to skip `None` estimators.
     - Ensure the `sample_weight` is used correctly only for non-`None` estimators.

Here is the step-by-step description of the changes to be made:

1. Locate the `fit` method inside the `VotingClassifier` class in `sklearn/ensemble/_voting.py`.
2. Identify the loop where each estimator's `fit` method is invoked.
3. Add a check to verify whether the estimator is `None` before fitting. Adjust the `sample_weight` usage accordingly.

By implementing these changes, the `VotingClassifier.fit` method will gracefully handle `None` estimators even when `sample_weight` is provided, preventing the `AttributeError` and ensuring robust functioning.

This modification ensures that the `VotingClassifier` can handle scenarios where an estimator might be intentionally set to `None`, enhancing its versatility and reliability in various machine learning workflows.
