**Title**: Check for None estimators before checking sample_weight support in VotingClassifier fit method

**Problem**: The `VotingClassifier` (and likely other voting estimators) will throw an `AttributeError` if `fit` is called and an estimator is set to `None` when sample weights are used. This is because the current implementation does not check if an estimator is `None` before checking if the estimator supports sample weights.

**Analysis**: The error occurs in the `fit` method of the `VotingClassifier` class when sample weights are passed as a parameter. The method iterates over all estimators and checks if each estimator supports `sample_weight` by calling `has_fit_parameter`. However, it doesn't first check if the estimator is `None`, which results in trying to invoke the `fit` method on a `NoneType` object, leading to an `AttributeError`.

**Proposed Changes**: 
- Modify the `fit` method in the `VotingClassifier` class to include a check for `None` before performing any operations on the estimators. Specifically, the section iterating through the estimators and checking for `sample_weight` support should be updated to skip any `None` estimators.

**File**: `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py`

1. **Function**: `fit`
   - Location within code selection: `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py:425-454`, `sklearn/ensemble/voting.py:98-114`

2. **Detailed Changes**:
   - Inside the `fit` method, locate the loop where it iterates over the `self.estimators` to check for `sample_weight` support.
   - Before invoking any method on the estimator (e.g., `has_fit_parameter`), add a conditional check to verify the estimator is not `None`.
   - Skip the iteration or continue to the next estimator if it is `None`.

**Description of Changes**:
1. **Add None Check for Estimators**:
   - In the `fit` method, update the loop that processes each estimator to check for `sample_weight` support.
   - Modify the condition to skip any estimators that are `None`.

By implementing this change, the code will correctly handle cases where an estimator is set to `None`, avoiding the `AttributeError`. This ensures that the `fit` method can proceed without failure even when some estimators are `None` and sample weights are provided.
