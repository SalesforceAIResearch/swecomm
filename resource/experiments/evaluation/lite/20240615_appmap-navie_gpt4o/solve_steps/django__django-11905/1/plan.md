**Title**: Raise error for non-boolean values in `__isnull` lookup

**Problem**:
The `__isnull` lookup currently accepts non-boolean values, abusing truthiness/falsiness. This behavior works fine for simple queries but does not promote `INNER JOIN` to an `OUTER JOIN`. As a result, using non-boolean values for `__isnull` can lead to inconsistent behavior, and this use case is undocumented and untested. We should enforce the usage of boolean values for the `__isnull` lookup by raising an error when non-boolean values are provided.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because there is no validation to ensure that the value provided for the `__isnull` lookup is a boolean. Developers may unintentionally pass non-boolean values, assuming any truthy/falsey value would work as intended. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially with complex queries involving joins.

To resolve this issue, we need to:
1. Identify where the `__isnull` lookup is processed in the code.
2. Add a validation step to ensure only boolean values are accepted.
3. Raise a `TypeError` or a more specific Django exception if the validation fails.

**Proposed Changes**:
The `__isnull` processing and validation can be implemented in the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file. This is where query lookups are handled and validated.

1. **File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

2. **Function**: Look for a method where query transformations and lookups are handled. This is likely around methods that manage filters or where clauses.

3. **Logic Change**:
   - Within the method handling the `__isnull` lookup (potentially in a `build_filter` method or similar), add a check to ensure the value provided is a boolean.
   - If the value is not a boolean, raise a `TypeError` with a descriptive message, e.g., "`__isnull` lookup value must be a boolean (True or False)".

Detailed steps:

1. **Locate the Method**:
   - Find the method that handles the transformation or processing of the `__isnull` lookup value. This will usually be in the section of code responsible for parsing filters or where conditions.

2. **Add Validation**:
   - Add a condition to check if the value provided for `__isnull` is a boolean.

3. **Raise Error On Failure**:
   - If the value is not a boolean, raise a `TypeError` or appropriate Django exception, ensuring the error message clearly indicates the issue.

For example, within the appropriate method:



4. **Integrate and Test**:
   - Ensure the change integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase.
   - Comprehensive testing will be handled in unit tests to validate these changes across various scenarios.

By ensuring the `__isnull` lookup only accepts boolean values, we prevent developers from using undocumented and possibly inconsistent query parameters, promoting code clarity and correctness.
