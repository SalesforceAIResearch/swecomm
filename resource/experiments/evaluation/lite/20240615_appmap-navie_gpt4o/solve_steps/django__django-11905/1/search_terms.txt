<issue>
Prevent using __isnull lookup with non-boolean value.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
__isnull should not allow for non-boolean values. Using truthy/falsey doesn't promote INNER JOIN to an OUTER JOIN but works fine for a simple queries. Using non-boolean values is â€‹undocumented and untested. IMO we should raise an error for non-boolean values to avoid confusion and for consistency.
