**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Solve the problem as if you... (2655)
2ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**

Migration crashes deleting an index_together if there is a unique_together on the same fields
Description
	
Happens with Django 1.11.10
Steps to reproduce:
1) Create models with 2 fields, add 2 same fields to unique_together and to index_together
2) Delete index_together -> Fail
It will fail at django/db/backends/base/schema.py, line 378, in _delete_composed_index(), ValueError: Found wrong number (2) of constraints for as this one will find two constraints, the _uniq and the _idx one. No way to get out of this...
The worst in my case is that happened as I wanted to refactor my code to use the "new" (Dj 1.11) Options.indexes feature. I am actually not deleting the index, just the way it is declared in my code.
I think there are 2 different points here:
1) The deletion... (1001)
