**Title:** Fix Migration Crash When Deleting `index_together` If `unique_together` Exists on Same Fields

**Problem:** 
When attempting to delete `index_together` from a model that has the same fields declared in `unique_together`, Django 1.11.10 crashes with a `ValueError` due to finding multiple constraints (_uniq and _idx) for the same fields. This issue occurs during schema migrations, particularly when refactoring the code to use Django 1.11's new `Options.indexes` feature.

**Analysis:** 
The root of the problem lies in the `_delete_composed_index` method in the schema migration logic. This method currently does not properly handle the case when both `index_together` and `unique_together` are defined on the same fields, resulting in an ambiguous constraint count. This needs to be resolved so that schema migrations can correctly distinguish between the unique and index constraints and handle deletion appropriately.

**Proposed Changes:**
Focus changes on modifying the `_delete_composed_index` method logic in the `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py` file to properly handle scenarios where both `index_together` and `unique_together` are defined on the same fields.

1. **File:** `django/db/backends/mysql/schema.py`
   - **Function:** `_delete_composed_index`
   - **Changes:**
     - Modify the constraint-checking logic to differentiate between unique and index constraints.
     - Add validation to ensure the function handles cases where both constraints are found, without raising an exception.
     - Ensure that removing the index does not conflict with existing unique constraints.

By making these adjustments, the migration should proceed without crashing, allowing the `index_together` to be redefined or removed without affecting the `unique_together` constraints.
