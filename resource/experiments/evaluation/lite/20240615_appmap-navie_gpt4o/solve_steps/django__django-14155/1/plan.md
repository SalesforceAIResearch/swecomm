**Title**: Handle `functools.partial` in `ResolverMatch.__repr__()` for better representation

**Problem**: 
When a partial function is set as the view in Django's URL routing, the `__repr__()` method of `ResolverMatch` class displays the function as `functools.partial`. This can be uninformative as it doesn't reveal the underlying function or the pre-set arguments of the partial function. Hence, we need to improve the representation by unwrapping the `functools.partial` objects within `ResolverMatch`.

**Analysis**:
The problem occurs because the `__repr__()` method of `ResolverMatch` does not account for functions wrapped with `functools.partial`. The correct approach is to unwrap such partial functions to obtain the original function and arguments for a clearer, more informative representation. This can be achieved by modifying the `__init__()` of the `ResolverMatch` class to check if the function is an instance of `functools.partial` and unwrap it accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**:
The relevant file to change is `django/urls/resolvers.py`. We need to modify the `__init__()` method of the `ResolverMatch` class to handle `functools.partial` objects appropriately. Below are the recommended changes:

1. **Import `functools`**: Ensure `functools` is imported at the top of `django/urls/resolvers.py`.

2. **Modify `__init__()` in `ResolverMatch`**:
   - Check if the `func` is an instance of `functools.partial`.
   - If it is, unwrap it to obtain the underlying function and its arguments.
   - Store these unwrapped details so that `__repr__()` can use them effectively.

3. **Update `__repr__()` in `ResolverMatch`**:
   - Ensure that `__repr__()` checks for the unwrapped function details and uses them to create the string representation.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
- **In `django/urls/resolvers.py`**:
  - Import `functools`: You may already have the necessary imports; if not, add `import functools`.
  - In the `__init__()` method of `ResolverMatch`:
    - Add logic to handle `functools.partial`.
    - Store both the original function and arguments unpacked from the partial function.
  - In the `__repr__()` method of `ResolverMatch`:
    - Use the stored unwrapped function and arguments for generating the representation string.

By implementing these changes, you will provide a more informative string representation for partial functions used in Django's URL routing, greatly enhancing debuggability and clarity. 

This approach ensures minimal code changes while addressing the key issue at hand.
