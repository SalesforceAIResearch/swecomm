**Title: Update AST Parsing Logic to Correct Statement Line Number Calculation in Python 3.9**

**Problem:**
When running tests using Python 3.9, the error message for failed assertions prints extra lines of code that are not directly related to the assertion itself. This issue does not occur with Python 3.7, indicating a potential problem with how statement line numbers are calculated in Python 3.9.

**Analysis:**
The primary issue is with the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) parsing logic that identifies the start and end lines of a statement. This functionality is critical for producing precise and useful error messages. In Python 3.9, there might have been changes in the internal AST structure or how line numbers are represented, which have caused this discrepancy.

The function `get_statement_startend2` in `source.py` is responsible for determining the beginning and ending line numbers of statements based on the AST nodes. Given that the error only appears in Python 3.9, it's likely that this function does not handle some scenarios properly, causing it to include additional lines.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **Modify `get_statement_startend2` in `source.py`:**
    - Update the logic of `get_statement_startend2` to correctly handle the new AST structure in Python 3.9.
    - Add conditionals to differentiate handling based on Python version, if necessary.

2. **Code Adjustment Details:**
    - In the function `get_statement_startend2`, review and update the traversal of AST nodes to ensure it accurately captures the start and end lines of statements in Python 3.9.
    - Ensure that the `finalbody` and `orelse` parts of statements are correctly handled and do not mistakenly extend the range of the original statement.
    - Thoroughly test to ensure no additional lines are included in the captured statement range, thereby ensuring the correct error message in failed assertions.

**File to be changed:**
- `src/_pytest/_code/source.py`

**Suggested changes in `src/_pytest/_code/source.py`:**
- Review and possibly refactor the logic within the `get_statement_startend2` function to ensure it suits the updated AST parsing in Python 3.9.
- Add unit tests to cover different edge cases, ensuring the function handles all scenarios accurately, especially for Python 3.9.

By addressing the AST parsing logic in the `get_statement_startend2` function, we can ensure that the error messages are accurate and concise, even for complex statements and decorators in Python 3.9.
