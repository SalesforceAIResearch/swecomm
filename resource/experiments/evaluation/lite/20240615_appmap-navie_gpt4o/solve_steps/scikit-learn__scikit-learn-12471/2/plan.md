**Title**: Fix OneHotEncoder to Properly Handle Unknown String Categories Without Raising ValueError

**Problem**: When OneHotEncoder is set to ignore unknown entries, and the categorical data contains strings, a ValueError can be raised due to the unsafe handling of the memory of arrays. Specifically, when unknown strings are set to the first category in `OneHotEncoder.categories_[i]`, this leads to a truncation error if the first category is a longer string than the unknown string in the array to be transformed. This issue arises due to the mismatch in string lengths, causing a ValueError during the transformation process.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue lies in the `_transform_selected` and `fit_transform` methods of the OneHotEncoder class. Here, the code fails to cast the array to object type when necessary, leading to truncation of strings.

Current behavior:
1. When `handle_unknown='ignore'` is set, the unknown categories should be ignored during transformation.
2. However, during the assignment of unknown categories to the first known category, string truncation occurs if the unknown categories are shorter than the first known category string.

Desired behavior:
1. The transformation should handle unknown string categories gracefully by casting arrays to objects if there is a potential string length mismatch.
2. Transform method should be updated to ensure that data is safely cast to object type, preventing ValueErrors.

**Proposed Changes**:
Focus on `sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py`.

1. **Method: `_transform_selected`**
   - **Line 639-660**: Add a check to determine the length of strings in `self.categories_[i][0]` and the array `X`. If a length mismatch is detected, cast `X_tr` to object type.

   - **Modification**:
     - Insert logic to validate string lengths and cast `X_tr` to object type if lengths are mismatched.

2. **Method: `fit_transform`**
   - **Line 476-502**: Update the transformation process to handle casting to object type more efficiently, ensuring that unknown categories are managed properly during transformation.

   - **Modification**:
     - Enhance logic for handling unknown categories by ensuring string length compatibility.

3. **Method: `transform`**
   - **Line 563-591**: Similar to changes in `_transform_selected` and `fit_transform`, ensure safe handling of string arrays when unknown categories are ignored.

   - **Modification**:
     - Update the transformation matrix construction process to include the check and cast to object type if necessary.

4. **Additional Testing**:
   - Ensure proper testing after casting arrays to object type to validate the fix.

**Summary of Required Changes**:
- `sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py`:
  - Within each point in the transformation pipeline (methods such as `_transform_selected`, `fit_transform`, and `transform`), add logic to check string lengths and handle casting to object type if necessary.
  
By making the above modifications within the specified methods of the OneHotEncoder class, we can ensure that unknown string categories are handled correctly and prevent the truncation errors that are currently leading to ValueErrors.
