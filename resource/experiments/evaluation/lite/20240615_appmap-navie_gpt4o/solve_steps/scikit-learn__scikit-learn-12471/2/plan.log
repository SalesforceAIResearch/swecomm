**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

OneHotEncoder ignore unknown error when categories are strings 
#### Description

This bug is very specific, but it happens when you set OneHotEncoder to ignore unknown entries.
and your labels are strings. The memory of the arrays is not handled safely and it can lead to a ValueError

Basically, when you call the transform method it will sets all the unknown strings on your array to OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] which is the first category alphabetically sorted given for fit
If this OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] is a long string, and the array that you want to transform has small strings, then it is impossible to fit the whole  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0] into the entries of the array we want to transform. So  OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0]  is truncated and... (2125)
