**Title**: Fix OneHotEncoder to Handle Unknown String Categories Safely

**Problem**: When using `OneHotEncoder` with `handle_unknown='ignore'` and input categories that are strings, transforming new data that contains unknown categories can lead to a ValueError. This occurs when the unknown category is substituted with the first known category from `OneHotEncoder.categories_`, and the length of this known category string exceeds the length of the unknown category string, causing array memory issues and truncation.

**Analysis**: 

The root cause of this issue lies in the handling of unknown categories in the `transform` method of `OneHotEncoder`. When encountering an unknown category, the encoder replaces it with the first known category (`OneHotEncoder.categories_[i][0]`). If the first known category is or includes a long string, this can cause issues because the input array’s memory is not dynamically adjusted to accommodate this longer string, leading to a truncation and raising a `ValueError`.

To resolve this bug, we need to ensure that the `transform` method handles the memory allocation of arrays properly when replacing unknown categories with known ones. Specifically, when an unknown category is encountered, we can cast the array elements to `object` type to prevent truncation and maintain data integrity.

**Proposed Changes**:

File: `sklearn/preprocessing/_encoders.py`

1. **Method `transform`**:
   - Before replacing unknown categories, check the data type of the input array. If the array contains strings, convert the array to an array of objects. This conversion will ensure that the memory can safely accommodate strings of varying lengths without risk of truncation.

2. **Method `_transform_new_values`**:
   - Instead of directly replacing unknown values with known categories, introduce a check to validate that the datatype conversion (into objects) is performed for all unknown values.

Here’s the proposed detailed modification:

1. **In `transform` method**:
   - Add a check to convert input data to object type if it contains strings and `handle_unknown='ignore'`.

   

2. **In `_transform_new_values` method**:
   - Ensure that any unknown values are safely replaced with the first category from `categories_` without causing truncation.

   

These changes aim to ensure the integrity and consistency of the encoding process while circumventing the ValueError raised due to array truncation.

By implementing these proposed fixes, we can handle unknown string categories safely in `OneHotEncoder` without encountering memory issues or ValueErrors.
