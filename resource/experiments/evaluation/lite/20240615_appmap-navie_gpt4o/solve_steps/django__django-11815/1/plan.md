**Title**: Modify Enum Handling in Migrations to Use Enum Names Instead of Values for Default CharField Fields

**Problem**:
When using an Enum object as a default value for a `CharField` in Django models, the generated migration file incorrectly uses the value of the Enum object instead of its name. This can cause errors if the Enum value is subject to translation, as the translated value may not match any Enum members. For example, if an Enum value "Good" is translated to another language, it will not match the original Enum, causing a `ValueError`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue is that the migration generation process in Django currently uses the string representation (i.e., value) of the Enum object when generating migration files. This behaviour is incorrect for default values of Enum types, especially when these values are subject to translation, as translated values may not correspond to the original Enum members.

To resolve this issue, the migration generation should instead use the Enum member names, which are stable and not subject to localization changes. Specifically, for Enum default values, migrations should be generated using the Enum name access syntax (`EnumName['MEMBER']`) instead of using the string representation of the value (`EnumName('Value')`).

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the logic in the Django codebase responsible for serializing the default values of model fields during migration file generation.

   **File: `django/db/migrations/operations/base.py`**
   - Adjust the logic in relevant functions that handle serialization to correctly serialize Enum default values using the name of the Enum member.
   - Update the `deconstruct` method to check if the default value is an instance of `Enum` and, if so, convert it to the name-based access form.

   Steps to implement:
   - Locate the part of the code in the `deconstruct` method that handles the default value serialization.
   - Add a condition to check if the default value is an instance of `Enum`.
   - If it is, convert the Enum member to its name-based representation.

Example Description of Changes (to be implemented):

1. **django/db/migrations/operations/base.py**
   - Locate the `deconstruct` method within the migration operations.
   - Modify the part of the method that handles the `default` attribute of model fields:
     - Add a condition to check if a value is an instance of `Enum` using `isinstance(value, enum.Enum)`.
     - If true, convert the Enum member to its name-based access (`Enum.__class__.__name__ + '[' + Enum.name + ']'`).

By implementing these changes, the migration files will correctly use the Enum member names for default values, ensuring they remain consistent even in the presence of translations.
