**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Migrations uses value of enum object instead of its name.
Description
	 
		(last modified by oasl)
	 
When using Enum object as a default value for a CharField, the generated migration file uses the value of the Enum object instead of the its name. This causes a problem when using Django translation on the value of the Enum object. 
The problem is that, when the Enum object value get translated to the users language, the old migration files raise an error stating that the Enum does not have the corresponding value. (because the Enum value is translated to another language)
Example:
Let say we have this code in models.py:
from enum import Enum
from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _
from django.db import models
class Status(Enum):
	GOOD = _('Good') # 'Go... (1643)
