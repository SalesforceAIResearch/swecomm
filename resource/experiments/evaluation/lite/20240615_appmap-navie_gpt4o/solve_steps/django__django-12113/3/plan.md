**Title**: Resolve Database Lock Issue in MultiDatabaseTests with SQLite Backend

**Problem**: The test case `admin_views.test_multidb` fails when using persistent test SQLite databases with the `--keepdb` option. The exception raised is an `sqlite3.OperationalError` indicating that the database is locked.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue is that SQLite has limitations with concurrent writes due to its locking mechanism. When multiple database connections are used, SQLite can lock the database, preventing other operations from executing. This problem is amplified in test environments where databases are often reused without being properly disconnected.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that:
1. Database connections are properly closed when not needed.
2. Test databases should be reset to a clean state.
3. Test cases involving database operations should handle potential locks more gracefully.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Improve Database Management in Tests**:
   - Ensure that database connections are properly closed after each test case.
   - Investigate if the `TEST` settings for SQLite databases in the Django settings module include proper configurations for isolation and connection lifetime.

2. **Modify Test Setup and Teardown**:
   - Ensure the test setup and teardown methods in `admin_views/test_multidb.py` properly handle database lock scenarios by explicitly closing database connections.
   - Utilize Djangoâ€™s `TestCase` class, which includes database teardown methods to reset the state and clear connections.

3. **Adjust Database Settings**:
   - Modify the `settings.py` or the test settings module for SQLite to include configurations that minimize lock contention.
   - Use in-memory databases for test cases where possible to avoid file-based locks.

**Files to be Changed**:
- **django/contrib/auth/models.py**:
  - Ensure that the user creation methods (`_create_user`, `create_superuser`) close the database connection or release any locks after user creation.

- **django/contrib/auth/base_user.py** and **django/db/models/base.py**:
  - Ensure that the `save` methods handle connection closing or transaction management better to avoid locking the database inadvertently.

**Detailed Changes**:

1. **django/contrib/auth/models.py**:
   - In methods `_create_user` and `create_superuser`, after creating and saving the user object, explicitly close the database connection if applicable.

2. **django/test/testcases.py**:
   - If not already done, implement explicit teardown methods to close any open database connections after test cases run.

3. **settings.py (or test settings module)**:
   - Update the SQLite `TEST` configuration to ensure the use of better isolation and connection handling. For instance:
     `DATABASES['default']['TEST']['OPTIONS'] = {'timeout': 100}`

Review these changes with the focus on ensuring SQLite database connections are properly managed and that the test setup and teardown processes handle potential locks gracefully. This should help mitigate the `database is locked` error during the tests.
