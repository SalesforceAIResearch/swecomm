**Title**: Resolve Database Lock Issue for Persistent Test SQLite Database

**Problem**: 
The `admin_views.test_multidb` test fails when using persistent SQLite databases with the `--keepdb` option due to an `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`. This error occurs while attempting database operations during test setup.

**Analysis**:
SQLite has limitations regarding concurrent writes. When using persistent test databases, concurrent access can lead to `database is locked` errors. This is particularly exacerbated by parallel test execution, even if only utilizing a single process (`--parallel 1`). 

This problem typically arises in scenarios where multiple connections might try to write to the database simultaneously, or where long-running transactions hold locks that block other transactions. The key observation is that the test fails during the setup phase with an operational error when attempting to save data to the database.

**Proposed Changes**:
The most relevant file for modification based on the provided code snippets is `django/db/backends/utils.py`, specifically within the `_execute_with_wrappers` and `execute` methods where the error originates. The suggested changes aim to handle and mitigate the locking issue by introducing a retry mechanism with exponential backoff for `sqlite3.OperationalError`.

1. **django/db/backends/utils.py**:
    - **Modify the `_execute_with_wrappers` method**:
        Implement a retry mechanism that catches `sqlite3.OperationalError` and retries the operation after a brief sleep, using exponential backoff to reduce the likelihood of encountering the same error repeatedly in quick succession.
    - **Update the `execute` method**:
        Ensure the retry logic is utilized here to manage the database locks gracefully instead of immediately propagating the error.

Detailed Steps:
- In the `_execute_with_wrappers` method, wrap the execution logic within a retry loop.
- Capture specific `sqlite3.OperationalError` exceptions.
- Implement a loop that retries the operation upon encountering an `sqlite3.OperationalError`, with a delay that increases exponentially on each retry, up to a maximum number of attempts.
- On exhausting retry attempts, re-raise the original exception to signal that the operation permanently failed.

These adjustments should allow the test setup and execution to proceed more reliably by reducing the impact of transient locking issues.

Here's the detailed description of necessary changes:

1. **Modify `_execute_with_wrappers` method:**
   - Introduce a retry logic that specifically catches `sqlite3.OperationalError`.
   - Implement an exponential backoff strategy, retrying the operation multiple times before giving up.

2. **Update `execute` method:**
   - Ensure the `execute` method utilizes the retry logic properly.
   - Implement similar retry logic in `executemany` if concurrent multiple inserts/updates are also prone to locking errors.

By incorporating these changes, the test cases should be more resilient to the SQLite locking issues commonly encountered in this scenario.
