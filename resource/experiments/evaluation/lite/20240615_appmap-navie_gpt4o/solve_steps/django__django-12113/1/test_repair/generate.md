The problem lies in the test file trying to import a module that doesn't exist because the specified path is incorrect for the database backend being tested. A `ModuleNotFoundError` is raised when trying to import `backends.sqlite.test_creation`. 

The correct path should match the one found in the provided code snippets, specifically `tests/backends/mysql/test_creation.py`.

Let's correct the import path.

```python

```

Since the import fails due to not matching the correct path, changing the relative path inside the `loadTestsFromName` method should resolve it.

```python

```

Thus, the problem is resolved by matching the correct path.
