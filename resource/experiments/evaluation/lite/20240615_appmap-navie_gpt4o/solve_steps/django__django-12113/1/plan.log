The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

admin_views.test_multidb fails with persistent test SQLite database.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
I've tried using persistent SQLite databases for the tests (to make use of
--keepdb), but at least some test fails with:
sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked
This is not an issue when only using TEST["NAME"] with "default" (which is good enough in terms of performance).
