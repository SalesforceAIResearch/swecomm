### Address SQLite Database Locking in Multi-Database Tests

**Problem**

The `admin_views.test_multidb` test fails with a persistent SQLite database when using the `--keepdb` option. The error `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` occurs, indicating multiple threads or processes are trying to access the database simultaneously, causing a lock.

**Analysis**

SQLite databases are known to have issues with concurrent access due to their locking mechanisms. The error occurs during the test setup phase when the `setUpClass` method is trying to create an admin user. The underlying cause is that the SQLite database doesn't handle parallel access well, especially in test environments where databases need to be frequently written to or read from.

To mitigate this issue in a test environment where multi-database configurations are being tested, we need to ensure that database access is sequential or use strategies that minimize locking contention.

**Proposed Changes**

The most relevant file to modify in this context is `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`, focusing on the database operation functions. We will make modifications to ensure that SQLite handles locks more gracefully.

1. **Modify the SQLite Database Backend to Handle Locking**
    - We need to adjust the `sqlite3` backend settings to handle database locking better. Specifically, we will modify the connection settings to retry database operations if a lock is encountered.

2. **Implement a Retry Logic for Database Operations**
    - Add a retry mechanism for operations involving database writes to handle the `OperationalError`.

Hereâ€™s how we can make these necessary changes:

- **File:** `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`
    - **Function:** `_execute`
        - Implement a retry mechanism for database operations in case of an `OperationalError: database is locked`. Use exponential backoff strategy for retry logic.
    - **Logic Changes:**
        1. Wrap the `execute` method in a try-except block.
        2. Catch `OperationalError`.
        3. Implement retry logic with sleep intervals.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Wrap Execution in a Try-Except Block:**

   The existing `execute` method should be wrapped in a try-except block to catch the `OperationalError`.

2. **Implement Retry Logic:**

   Introduce a loop that will retry the action a few times (e.g., 5 retries) with an increasing delay interval (e.g., 0.1 seconds, 0.2 seconds, 0.4 seconds, etc.) to make the system more resilient to temporary locks.

3. **Code Changes:**

   **File: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/base.py`**

   - Locate the `_execute` method where the actual SQL execution happens.
   - Implement the retry logic within this method.

**Conclusion**

By implementing a retry mechanism in the SQLite backend for Django, we address the `database is locked` issues arising in test environments running multi-database configurations. This change helps ensure reliability and stability when running tests with `--keepdb` and parallel settings, mitigating the locking issues inherent to SQLite.

Once these changes are implemented, the tests should run more reliably, even under conditions that previously caused database lock errors.
