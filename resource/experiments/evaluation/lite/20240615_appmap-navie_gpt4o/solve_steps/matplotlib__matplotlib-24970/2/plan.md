**Title**: Update Deprecated NumPy Integer Conversions in `LinearSegmentedColormap` class

**Problem**:
The Deprecation Warnings are generated due to NumPy's updated handling of integer conversions, which no longer allows out-of-bound values to be silently converted to the required type. This is triggered when the `LinearSegmentedColormap` class attempts to modify the color map array using out-of-range values.

**Analysis**:
In version 1.24, NumPy introduced stricter rules for type conversion and bounds checking on integer operations. The deprecated behavior allowed out-of-bound values to wrap around. Current deprecation warnings suggest that such behavior will fail in future versions.

The specific warnings stem from lines where the `LinearSegmentedColormap` class assigns out-of-range values to a NumPy array of type `uint8`. These arrays store color mappings, and certain indices need to be assigned specific "out-of-bounds" values `_i_over`, `_i_under`, and `_i_bad`.

To resolve this, we'll need to cast these assignments safely using NumPy's `astype` method or directly ensure the value transformations within the acceptable bounds before assignments.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `LinearSegmentedColormap` class code in the `lib/matplotlib/colors.py` file. Focus on the assignment operations that use `_i_over`, `_i_under`, and `_i_bad` indices, ensuring the transformations are within valid bounds.

1. **Update the `_scale_segment_data` function to ensure the assignment of color values respects the uint8 bounds**:
   Modify the sections where values may be out-of-bound (larger than 255 or less than 0) by using safe casting or clipping methods to constrain them within the valid range of `uint8`.

2. **Relevant Section to Update in `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`:**
   - Locate where the specific warnings are being generated. This should involve refactoring the assignments to use `.clip(0, 255)` or normalization techniques to handle the `_i_over`, `_i_under`, and `_i_bad` values.
   - Update the assignment logic that manipulates the color arrays.

3. **Detailed section (around lines 730-732):**
   - Apply `.astype(np.uint8)` conversion to wrap values correctly.
   - Use `np.clip` if value normalization is required immediately before assignments to ensure they comply with `uint8` limits.

**Example**:
Suppose the code contains:


Replace with modifications like:

Review this plan carefully and apply the proposed changes to `lib/matplotlib/colors.py` where such assignments trigger out-of-bound errors. Ensure the new logic conforms to the latest NumPy version requirements while preserving the existing behavior of color re-assignments for matplotlib.
