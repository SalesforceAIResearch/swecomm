**Title**: Address NumPy 1.24 Deprecation Warnings in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`

**Problem**: Numerical issues arise when using Matplotlib with NumPy 1.24 due to deprecation warnings related to the conversion of out-of-bound Python integers to integer arrays within the colormap handling logic.

**Analysis**:
The deprecation warnings indicate that certain elements in the array manipulation are being converted incorrectly according to future NumPy versions' stricter rules. Specifically, these warnings occur when values outside the range of `uint8` (0-255) are being assigned, and NumPy will soon enforce these boundaries strictly.

The affected lines in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py` appear to handle such conversions. To mitigate the issue, we can use NumPy's array functions to enforce valid ranges before the problematic assignments.

Based on the deprecation warnings:
1. `xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over` could trigger the warning if `self.N - 1` results in values greater than `uint8` can handle.
2. `xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under` could trigger the warning if any negative values are processed.
3. `xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad` could be similar with values processed through the `mask_bad`.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify `lib/matplotlib/cm.py` to handle out-of-bound values explicitly before assignment. This would typically involve using `np.clip` to limit integer conversions within the appropriate ranges.

Changes to be made in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`:

1. **In the function handling the assignment of `xa[xa > self.N - 1] = self._i_over`**:
   - Before the assignment, ensure the values in `xa` are clipped within valid `uint8` ranges.
   
2. **Facilitate range enforcement where `xa[xa < 0] = self._i_under` is assigned**:
   - Similar to the prior adjustment, use `np.clip` or equivalent to ensure values are within bounds before the assignment.
   
3. **Modify `xa[mask_bad] = self._i_bad` logic**:
   - Ensure that `self._i_bad` values are embedded correctly within proper `uint8` bounds.

Specifically, in each relevant part of `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`:
- Before array assignments that could involve values outside the `uint8` valid range, add a `np.clip` operation.

**Example modification around one area**:
- Convert:

Ensure you perform similar changes in the corresponding points for other deprecation points mentioned.

These changes should ensure no warnings appear when Matplotlib runs with NumPy 1.24, preserving the expected behavior without deprecation notices.
