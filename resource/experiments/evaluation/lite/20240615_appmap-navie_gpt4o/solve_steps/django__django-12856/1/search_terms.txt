Add check for fields of UniqueConstraints.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Marnanel Thurman)
	 
When a model gains a UniqueConstraint, makemigrations doesn't check that the fields named therein actually exist.
This is in contrast to the older unique_together syntax, which raises models.E012 if the fields don't exist.
In the attached demonstration, you'll need to uncomment "with_unique_together" in settings.py in order to show that unique_together raises E012.
