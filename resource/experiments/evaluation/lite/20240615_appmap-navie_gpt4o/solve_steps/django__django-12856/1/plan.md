**Title**: Add Validation for Fields in `UniqueConstraint` During Migration

**Problem**: 
When defining a `UniqueConstraint` in a Django model, the `makemigrations` command does not currently validate whether the fields specified in the constraint actually exist in the model. This results in potential runtime errors that could have been caught during migration generation, contrasting with the older `unique_together` syntax which raises `models.E012` if the fields do not exist.

**Analysis**:
To ensure the robustness of migrations and consistency with the behavior of `unique_together`, we need to add checks for the existence of fields specified in `UniqueConstraint`. The existing Django validation infrastructure can be extended to validate fields in `UniqueConstraint` during migration generation.

Steps to perform the validations:
1. Modify the `_check_unique_together` function in `django.db.models.options.ModelOptions` to include checks for `UniqueConstraint`.
2. Extract the current validation logic for `unique_together` and ensure it can handle both `unique_together` and `unique_constraints`.
3. Integrate the field existence checks seamlessly into the migration framework to raise appropriate errors when fields in `UniqueConstraint` are not found.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **`django/db/models/options.py`**:
   - Modify the `_check_unique_together` method or create a new one to handle the validation of `UniqueConstraints`.
   - Loop through all `UniqueConstraint` objects in the model and validate that each field in each constraint exists in the model's fields.

2. **`django/db/models/options.py`**:
   - In the `model_options` `__init__` method, ensure `unique_together` and `unique_constraints` are both normalized using the same function `normalize_together`.

3. **`django/core/checks/model_checks.py`**:
   - Add error handling and checks to produce `models.E012` for missing fields in `UniqueConstraint`.

Detailed file changes:

- **File: `django/db/models/options.py`**:
  - **Function/Method: `_check_unique_together`** (or appropriate new validation handler):
    - Ensure it handles `UniqueConstraint` by explaining the logic changes and the point at which validation happens for `unique_constraints`.

- **File: `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`**:
  - Enhance the function that processes model checks to include entries for `UniqueConstraint`, raising appropriate validation errors (`models.E012`).

By making these changes, we ensure `UniqueConstraint` benefits from the same level of robustness and early error detection as `unique_together`, enhancing the migration process' reliability.
