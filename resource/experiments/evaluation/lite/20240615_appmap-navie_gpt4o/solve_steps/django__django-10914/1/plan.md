**Title**: Set Default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` in Django File Upload Handlers

**Problem**: 
When files are uploaded using Django's `FileSystemStorage`, the permissions of the uploaded file can be inconsistent if `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not explicitly set. On some systems, using the default `FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS` can result in the uploaded file having permissions of `0o0600` (read and write for the owner only). This inconsistency arises due to the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` function setting secure file permissions by default. Consequently, files uploaded could have unintended restricted access, causing potential accessibility issues.

**Analysis**: 
The file permissions issue occurs because temporary files created by the `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` method are set with `0o0600` permissions, primarily for security reasons. When these temporary files are moved or renamed in the upload process, the default permissions are retained, leading to inconsistencies. To ensure that the file permissions for uploaded files are consistent and predictable, a default permission value should be explicitly set using the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting.

The solution involves modifying the file upload handling functions to check whether a default file permissions value (`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`) is set in the settings. If not set, we should explicitly set it to `0o644` (read and write for the owner, and read-only for others). This will ensure consistent permissions across different environments and file upload scenarios.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/core/files/storage.py`
   - Modify the `_save` method in the `FileSystemStorage` class to apply the default file permissions (`0o644`) when saving files, if `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not set in the settings.

**Detailed Changes**:

1. Modify the `FileSystemStorage` class in `django/core/files/storage.py`:

   - Change the `_save` method to include a check for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`. If it is not set, apply a default value of `0o644` to the file being saved.

   

This change ensures that any file saved using `FileSystemStorage` will have consistent permissions of `0o644` unless explicitly configured otherwise in `settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`.
