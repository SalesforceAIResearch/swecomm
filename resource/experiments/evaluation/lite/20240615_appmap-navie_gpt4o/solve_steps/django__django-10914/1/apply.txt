Sure, let's address the issue where file permissions need to be explicitly set to `0o644` if `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not provided in the settings. This change will ensure consistent file accessibility across different environments.

### Change Proposal

Modify the `_save` method of the `FileSystemStorage` class in `django/core/files/storage.py` to apply a default file permission of `0o644` when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not set.

### Specific Changes

Add a conditional check in `_save` method to set file permissions to `0o644` if `self.file_permissions_mode` is `None`.

### Updated Code:

Here are the exact changes to be applied:

### Summary of the Changes:
- **Original**: Applied `self.file_permissions_mode` if it was not `None`.
- **Modified**: Now also apply a default permission of `0o644` if `self.file_permissions_mode` is `None`.

This will ensure that files uploaded via `FileSystemStorage` will have consistent and appropriate permissions (`0o644`), unless explicitly set otherwise in the settings.
