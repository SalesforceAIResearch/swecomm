**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

The temp module provides a NamedTemporaryFile that can be reopened in the same
process on any platform. Most platforms use the standard Python
tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile class, but Windows users are given a custom class.

This is needed because the Python implementation of NamedTemporaryFile uses the
O_TEMPORARY flag under Windows, which prevents the file from being reopened
if the same flag is not provided [1][2]. Note that this does not address the
more general issue of opening a file for writing and reading in multiple
processes in a manner that works across platforms.

The custom version of NamedTemporaryFile doesn't support the same keyword
arguments available in tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile.

Set default FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION to 0o644.
Description
	
Hello,
As far as I can see, the â€‹File Uploads documentation page does not mention any permission issues.
What I would like to see is a warning that in absence of explicitly configured FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS, the permissions for a file uploaded to FileSystemStorage might not be consistent depending on whether a MemoryUploadedFile or a TemporaryUploadedFile was used for temporary storage of the uploaded data (which, with the default FILE_UPLOAD_HANDLERS, in turn depends on the uploaded data size).
The tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence causes the resulting file permissions to be 0o0600 on some systems (I experience it here on CentOS 7.4.1708 and Python 3.6.5). In all probability, the implementatio... (1063)
