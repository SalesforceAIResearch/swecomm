### Title:
Set default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` to `0o644` 

### Problem:
Inconsistent file permissions are assigned to uploaded files when `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` is not explicitly configured. This inconsistency arises depending on whether a `MemoryUploadedFile` or a `TemporaryUploadedFile` is used, leading to permissions set by `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile` and `os.rename` potentially resulting in `0o0600` on some systems.

### Analysis:
The root cause of this problem is that the default behavior of the built-in `tempfile` module in Python sets strict permissions (`0o0600`) for security reasons when creating temporary files. When these temporary files are used by Django's `FileSystemStorage` and subsequently renamed using `os.rename`, the restrictive permissions can persist, creating inconsistency.

### Proposed Changes:
Ensure that uploaded files have a consistent permission setting by modifying the permissions after file upload. Specifically, we will set the file permissions to `0o644` after the upload process is complete by explicitly changing the file permissions in the relevant handler.

#### Modifications Needed:

1. **File: django/core/files/uploadhandler.py**
    - **Within the `TemporaryUploadedFile` class**:
        - After the temporary file is created and written to, ensure the permissions are set to `0o644`.

2. **File: django/core/files/move.py**
    - **Within the `file_move_safe` function**:
        - After the file move operation has completed, set the permissions of the new file to `0o644`.

#### Detailed Changes:

**File:** `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py`
- **Class: TemporaryUploadedFile > Method: __init__**
  - Add logic to set the file permissions after the file is created and data is written to it.
    - Use `os.chmod` to set the permissions of the file.

**File:** `django/core/files/move.py`
- **Function: file_move_safe**
  - After successfully moving the file and copying the file metadata, add logic to set the file permissions of the new file using `os.chmod`.

These changes will help ensure that all uploaded files, regardless of the temporary storage mechanism used, will have consistent and appropriate permissions by default.

### Proposed Changes in Detail:

1. **File: `django/core/files/uploadhandler.py`**
   - **Location:** After the temporary file is created in the `TemporaryUploadedFile.__init__`
   - **Change:** 
     - Add `os.chmod(self.file.name, 0o644)` after creating the temporary file.

2. **File: `django/core/files/move.py`**
   - **Location:** At the end of the `file_move_safe` function, after the file has been moved and metadata copied.
   - **Change:** 
     - Add `os.chmod(new_file_name, 0o644)` to set the file permissions.

By implementing these changes, we ensure that files uploaded to the file system have consistent permissions, addressing the reported issue.
