**Title**: Modify SQLite Migration Handling to Avoid "." Operator Prohibition in Index Expressions

**Problem**: 
When attempting to alter the `Tag` model's `value` field in a SQLite database, the migration crashes due to the constraint containing the "." operator, which is not allowed in index expressions by SQLite. The error message encountered is: `django.db.utils.OperationalError: the "." operator prohibited in index expressions`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is within the SQLite backend of Django, specifically when the migration tries to add a unique constraint that involves expressions using the "." operator. SQLite does not support such expressions in index definitions.

The `_remake_table` method in the SQLite database schema editor is responsible for rebuilding the table to apply the new field definition. During this process, the constraints are also recreated. However, given SQLite's restriction on the "." operator in index expressions, this process fails.

To resolve the issue, we need to adapt the constraint handling logic within the `_remake_table` method for SQLite. Specifically, we should avoid constructing index expressions that use the "." operator during the table remaking.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`
2. **Method**: `_remake_table`

   Describe necessary changes:
   - Check the constraints being applied to ensure that no expressions use the "." operator.
   - If such expressions are present, rewrite or skip them in a way that complies with SQLite's restrictions.
   - Ensure the unique constraints are handled correctly without causing operational errors in SQLite.

Below are the detail changes needed:

1. **Class**: `DatabaseSchemaEditor`
2. **Method**: `_remake_table`
   - Add a check for the presence of the "." operator in the constraint expressions.
   - If the constraint contains the "." operator, modify or skip the expression to conform to SQLite's limitations.

By making these changes, the process of remaking the table will avoid the use of prohibited operators in index expressions, thus preventing migration failures in SQLite.

This solution ensures better compatibility of Django's migration framework with SQLite's constraints and should mitigate the described crashes.
