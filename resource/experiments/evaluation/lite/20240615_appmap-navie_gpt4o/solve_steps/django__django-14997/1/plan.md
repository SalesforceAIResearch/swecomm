**Title**: Fix the SQLite unique constraint issue in table remake

**Problem**: When running a migration that alters a field in a table with a unique constraint using SQLite, the migration fails with the error: "the '.' operator prohibited in index expressions."

**Analysis**: 
The problem occurs because SQLite does not allow the use of the '.' (dot) operator in index expressions. The SQLite backend in Django tries to recreate the entire table when modifying some fields and, in doing so, it attempts to recreate the unique constraints. However, the unique constraint utilized here involves the '.' operator which is against SQLite's rules.

The existing table is remade by the `_remake_table` method. This method is triggered for various alterations like changing field properties, which includes the unique constraints. Specifically, the use of SQLite's restrictions on index expressions is missing proper handling in Django's schema editor when remaking tables.

**Proposed Changes**:
In order to remedy this, modifications should be made to how these constraints are handled during the remaking of the table. Specifically, within the `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py` file, adjustments should be made in methods that are responsible for applying these constraints to ensure compliance with SQLite restrictions.

Here are the changes to be made:

1. **Modify `_remake_table` Function**:
   - Modify the logic in `_remake_table` to ensure the unique constraints are properly recreated without violating SQLite's restrictions.

2. **Skip Problematic Constraints During Table Remake**:
   - Implement steps to skip or alter problematic unique constraints temporarily during the table alteration process and then re-apply or adjust them appropriately afterward.

Changes to be made to `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`:

- Enhance the `_remake_table` method to handle unique constraints appropriately during the field alterations.
- Accommodate the recreation of constraints by possibly simplifying or ignoring problematic expressions temporarily.



By detailing these modifications, the developer should be able to adjust the schema editor's behavior to ensure it aligns with SQLite's constraints, thus resolving the error encountered during the migrations.
