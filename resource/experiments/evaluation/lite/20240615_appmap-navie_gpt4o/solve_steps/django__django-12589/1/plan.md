**Title**: Fix "GROUP BY" clauses error in Django 3.0 when querying with field annotations

**Problem**: 
In Django 3.0, a `ProgrammingError` occurs when evaluating a query with `GROUP BY` clauses involving field annotations. The specific error is "column reference 'status' is ambiguous". This issue does not occur in Django 2.2.11 where the same query executes correctly. The difference lies in how the `GROUP BY` clauses are generated in Django 3.0, leading to ambiguity in column reference.

**Analysis**: 
The issue seems to stem from changes in how Django 3.0 handles annotations and `GROUP BY` clauses in SQL queries. Specifically, when an annotated field (like `status`) is used both in the `SELECT` and `GROUP BY` clauses, the generated SQL query does not account for potential column name ambiguities introduced by subqueries. In Django 2.2.11, the aliasing and scoping of subqueries in `GROUP BY` statements are handled differently, thus avoiding this ambiguity.

To rectify this, we need to ensure that the generated SQL from Django 3.0 handles subquery aliasing in `GROUP BY` clauses appropriately. This can involve looking into Djangoâ€™s ORM internals, specifically how the `QuerySet` and annotations are constructed and whether there are differences in the SQL generation process between Django versions 2.2.11 and 3.0.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the method responsible for generating the `GROUP BY` clause in the Django ORM to ensure it correctly handles the aliasing of subqueries.

1. **File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`
    - **Function**: `_add_qs_annotations(self)` - This function constructs the SQL for annotations and the corresponding `GROUP BY` clause.
    - **Change**: Enhance the logic in this function to properly alias subquery-generated fields in `GROUP BY` clauses. Ensure that the field names derived from subqueries are aliased in a manner that avoids ambiguity.

2. **File**: `django/db/models/query.py`
    - **Function**: `annotate(self, *args, **kwargs)` - This function adds annotations to the queryset.
    - **Change**: Refine how annotations and subqueries are processed within the queryset. Ensure subquery annotations are given unique aliases to prevent naming collisions in the final SQL.

3. **File**: `django/db/models/sql/aggregates.py`
    - **Function**: `get_group_by_cols(self, source_expressions, alias_col=False)` - Responsible for adding columns to the `GROUP BY` clause.
    - **Change**: Adjust the logic to correctly reference subquery fields and prevent ambiguous column names.

**Detailed description of changes**:

1. **django/db/models/sql/query.py:**
    - Locate the `_add_qs_annotations(self)` function.
    - Modify the logic where annotations are processed to ensure any fields derived from subqueries have unique aliases.
    - Add validation to check for any potential ambiguities in the generated SQL.

2. **django/db/models/query.py:**
    - Within the `annotate(self, *args, **kwargs)` function, improve the handling of subquery results.
    - Implement alias generation mechanisms for fields coming from subqueries to ensure unique naming in SQL.

3. **django/db/models/sql/aggregates.py:**
    - Update the `get_group_by_cols` function to refine how subquery-generated fields are handled.
    - Ensure the `GROUP BY` clause correctly references these fields with their unique aliases.

By making these changes, the Django ORM will correctly handle `GROUP BY` clause generation even with complicated field annotations involving subqueries, thereby resolving the ambiguity and matching the functionality seen in Django 2.2.11.
