**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Solve the problem as if you... (2655)
1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**
This is a description of the problem that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be

Focus the plan on modifying exactly one file.

Do not modify test case files. Test case files are those that include "test", "tests" in their paths,

    Case II. ``max_degrees`` and ``min_degrees`` are both lists
    ===========================================================

    If ``max_degrees = [d_1, ..., d_n]`` and
    ``min_degrees = [e_1, ..., e_n]``, the number of monomials generated
    is:

    .. math::

itermonomials returns incorrect monomials when using min_degrees argument
`itermonomials` returns incorrect monomials when using optional `min_degrees` argument

For example, the following code introduces three symbolic variables and generates monomials with max and min degree of 3:


```
import sympy as sp
from sympy.polys.orderings import monomial_key

x1, x2, x3 = sp.symbols('x1, x2, x3')
states = [x1, x2, x3]
max_degrees = 3
min_degrees = 3
monomials = sorted(sp.itermonomials(states, max_degrees, min_degrees=min_degrees), 
                   key=monomial_key('grlex', states))
print(monomials)
```
The code returns `[x3**3, x2**3, x1**3]`, when it _should_ also return monomials such as `x1*x2**2, x2*x3**2, etc...` that also have total degree of 3. This behaviour is ... (1082)
