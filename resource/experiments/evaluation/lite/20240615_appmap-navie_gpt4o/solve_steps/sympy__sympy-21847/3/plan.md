**Title: Correct `itermonomials` function to include mixed monomials with specified min_degrees**

**Problem**: 
The `itermonomials` function returns incorrect monomials when the optional `min_degrees` argument is used. Specifically, it fails to generate all possible monomials that include mixed degrees of variables when both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are set to the same value (e.g., 3). The function currently only returns monomials where each variable's degree matches the `min_degrees`, missing mixed degree monomials such as `x1*x2**2`.

**Analysis**:
The issue lies in the logic responsible for generating the monomials within the given degree constraints. When both `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` are provided, the function should generate all combinations of monomials that fall within the total degree range specified by these arguments. However, the current implementation seems to only consider monomials where each variable's degree matches the `min_degrees`, hence missing out on mixed degree combinations.

To resolve this issue, the implementation should include additional logic to ensure that all possible combinations of variables' degrees are considered, as long as they fall between the specified `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `itermonomials` function in the `sympy/polys/monomials.py` file:

1. **Update Logic for Mixed Degree Combinations**: Ensure that combinations of variable degrees that sum up to the total degree within the min and max constraints are generated and yielded.
2. **Validate Combined Degree Logic**: Check if the combined degree of generated monomials falls within the specified total degree constraints.
3. **Yield All Valid Monomials**: Ensure that all valid combinations of monomials are yielded, covering the range from `min_degrees` to `max_degrees`.

Modify the generator part of the `itermonomials` function to include the mixed monomials:

**Relevant Function and Location**:
- File: `sympy/polys/monomials.py`
- Function: `itermonomials`
- Relevant lines to change: Add logic to generate mixed degree monomials that respect the given min and max degrees.

1. Update to first check within the current logic of combinations and replacements.
2. Ensure to yield the combination that fits within the constraints.

By making these changes, the function will correctly generate all possible monomials, including mixed degrees, within the specified constraints of `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` as intended by the documentation and user expectations.
