**Title**: Fix `itermonomials` to Correctly Generate Monomials with Given `min_degrees`

**Problem**: 
The `itermonomials` function in `sympy.polys.monomials` returns incorrect results when the `min_degrees` argument is specified. Specifically, the function ignores valid monomials whose total degree equals `min_degrees`.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises when both `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` are integers. The current implementation only generates monomials up to the `max_degrees` without ensuring the lower bound given by `min_degrees`. The logic incorrectly filters out some monomials that should be included based on the total degree.

**Cause**:
The logic to handle the case where `min_degrees` is specified is inadequately implemented. The filtering mechanism to include monomials should ensure that monomials satisfy both the minimum and maximum degree constraints.

**Proposed Changes**:
File: `sympy/polys/monomials.py`

1. Update the function body of `itermonomials` to correctly generate monomials within the specified `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` range.
2. Ensure that when `total_degree` mode is active, monomials with total degrees falling between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` are generated.
3. Adjust the list comprehensions and combinations logic to account for the lower bound of `min_degrees`.

### Detailed Changes:
1. **Function Definition - `itermonomials`**:
    - **Line: Insert**: Add logic to check and ensure the inclusion of monomials that meet the `min_degrees` constraints.
    - **Within the first case (both integers)**:
      - Adjust the list comprehension and combination generation to ensure monomials are generated between the specified `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`.
      - Include filtering conditions that will yield monomials satisfying the `min_degrees` total requirement.

**Result**:
Following these changes, the `itermonomials` function will correctly produce monomials that meet the given degrees constraints, both minimum and maximum, ensuring consistency with the documented behavior.

Ensure the logic for `total_degree` mode, as well as specific degree checks on each variable, is followed precisely to avoid any missed conditions or generating excess monomials that don't meet criteria.

By focusing the changes on this function, other parts of the code using `itermonomials` will inherit the corrected behavior without requiring adjustments.
