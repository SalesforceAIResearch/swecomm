**Title**: Correct `itermonomials` to Include All Monomials within `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` Range

**Problem**: 
The `itermonomials` function doesn't correctly generate monomials within the specified `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` range. It fails to include all possible monomials for the given range, only returning monomials where all variables are raised to exactly `min_degrees`. This behavior is inconsistent with the documented functionality and expectations.

**Analysis**:
The `itermonomials` function is designed to generate monomials within a specified degree range. However, it currently only generates monomials where each variable strictly meets the `min_degrees` requirement for its degree. Specifically, when `min_degrees` is set to a value other than zero, the function doesn't generate monomials such as `x1*x2**2`, `x2*x3**2`, etc., which should be included when the total degree is equal to `min_degrees`.

The root cause lies in the logic that handles the generation of monomials when `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` are provided. The function needs to be modified to ensure that it not only checks the degree of each variable but also generates all possible combinations of degrees within the specified range.

**Proposed Changes**:
To fix this issue, changes are required in the handling of the total degree generation when both `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` are lists or integers. Here's what needs to be done:

1. **Iterate Over All Possible Degree Combinations**:
   - In the section where the function handles `max_degrees` and `min_degrees` as lists, ensure it generates combinations of degrees for all variables that fall within the specified range.
   - Adjust the loops and conditional checks to include all valid monomials that meet the criteria of total degrees.

2. **Update Code Logic in `itermonomials` Definition**:
   - Modify the logic where the function iterates over ranges of degrees such that all combinations of degrees within the range are considered.
   - Adjust the validation checks to include these combinations correctly.

### Suggested Changes in `sympy/polys/monomials.py`:

1. Update the `itermonomials` function code to properly handle the generation of monomials within the `min_degrees` and `max_degrees` requirements.



These adjustments will correct the behavior of `itermonomials` to ensure it generates all monomials that fall within the specified degree constraints, adhering to the documented intent and expected functionality.
