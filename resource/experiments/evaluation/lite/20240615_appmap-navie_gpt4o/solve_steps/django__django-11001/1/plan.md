### Title: Normalize SQL orderings to address incorrect removal of multiline RawSQL clauses in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()

### Problem
The `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method in Django's ORM is incorrectly removing some `order_by` clauses created with multiline `RawSQL` expressions. This occurs because the method identifies duplicates based only on the last line containing `ASC` or `DESC` keywords, which can match across multiple raw queries with identical last lines. As a result, only the first matching clause is retained, leading to incorrect SQL generation.

### Analysis
The underlying issue arises from the way `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` processes and deduplicates order_by clauses. The method uses a regular expression that erroneously captures only the last line of each ordering SQL, leading to false positives when it comes to detecting duplicates. Given that SQL statements can be multiline, this approach is flawed as it does not consider the entire statement.

To mitigate this issue, a proper solution would be to normalize the SQL orderings by removing newline characters before the deduplication logic. This will ensure that the entire ordering clause is considered, rather than just the last line.

### Proposed Changes
1. **File**: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`
   - Locate the `get_order_by` method, which is responsible for generating the ORDER BY part of the SQL query.
   - Before using the regular expression to search for ordering parts, modify the SQL string to normalize it by removing newline characters.
   - Ensure that this transformation handles potential encoding and end-of-line issues properly.

#### Detailed Changes:
- Find the line containing `without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)`.
- Modify the query string `sql` to join lines into a single line string before applying the regular expression search. For instance:
  - Create a new variable `sql_normalized` that contains `sql` with newline characters removed: `sql_normalized = ' '.join(sql.split('\n'))`.
  - Replace `self.ordering_parts.search(sql)` with `self.ordering_parts.search(sql_normalized)`.

These changes will ensure that entire SQL order clauses are considered, not just the last line, leading to accurate deduplication and retention of all relevant order-by expressions.

### Example Implementation:
- **Location**: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`
- **Code to Change**:
  
- **Modified Code**:
  

By implementing these changes, the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` method will be able to correctly handle and retain all multiline `RawSQL` clauses, ensuring the generated SQL queries are accurate.
