**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Incorrect removal of order_by clause created as multiline RawSQL
Description
	
Hi.
The SQLCompiler is ripping off one of my "order by" clause, because he "thinks" the clause was already "seen" (in SQLCompiler.get_order_by()). I'm using expressions written as multiline RawSQLs, which are similar but not the same. 
The bug is located in SQLCompiler.get_order_by(), somewhere around line computing part of SQL query without ordering:
without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)
The sql variable contains multiline sql. As a result, the self.ordering_parts regular expression is returning just a line containing ASC or DESC words. This line is added to seen set, and because my raw queries have identical last lines, only the first clasue is returing from SQLCompi... (2262)
