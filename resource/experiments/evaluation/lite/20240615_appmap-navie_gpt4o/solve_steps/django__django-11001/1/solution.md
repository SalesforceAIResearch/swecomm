Sure, I'll make the necessary changes to the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method to normalize the SQL orderings by removing newline characters before the deduplication logic.

The key alteration involves normalizing the `sql` string within the `get_order_by` function.

Let's proceed with the changes:

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">django/db/models/sql/compiler.py</file>
<original line-count="4" no-ellipsis="true">
<![CDATA[
without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)
params_hash = make_hashable(params)
if (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:
    continue
]]>
</original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true">
<![CDATA[
# Normalize the SQL by removing newline characters before deduplication
sql_normalized = ' '.join(sql.split('\n'))
without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_normalized).group(1)
params_hash = make_hashable(params)
if (without_ordering, params_hash) in seen:
    continue
]]>
</modified>
</change>
```

This change ensures that the entire ordering clause is taken into account during the deduplication process, preventing the issue caused by only considering the last line in SQL statements.

Is there anything else you'd like to modify or any additional features you'd like to incorporate?
