**Title**: Extend `Point.vel()` to Calculate Velocity Dynamically if not Predefined

**Problem**:
The `Point.vel()` method in SymPy currently raises a `ValueError` if the velocity of the point is not explicitly defined in the given reference frame. This behavior is inconsistent with how angular velocity is handled for reference frames, where the angular velocity can be computed dynamically if the orientation is specified. For points, it's expected that the velocity should also be dynamically computable if the position is defined as a symbolic time-dependent expression.

**Analysis**:
In the current implementation of `Point.vel()`, the method returns the velocity value from the internal `_vel_dict`. If the velocity is not found, it raises a `ValueError`. The enhancement involves modifying the method to calculate the velocity vector dynamically when it is not explicitly defined but the position is available. Specifically, the position vector of the point in terms of another point and reference frame can be differentiated with respect to time to derive the velocity.

Steps for the enhancement:
1. Modify `Point.vel()` to first check the `_vel_dict`.
2. If no predefined velocity is found, check if the position of the point relative to another point is defined.
3. If the position is defined, differentiate this position with respect to the dynamicsymbols time parameter (usually `t`) in the given reference frame to compute the velocity.
4. Cache the computed velocity in the `_vel_dict` for future calls.

**Proposed Changes**:
File to be modified: `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`.

1. **Modify `Point.vel` Method**:
   - In the `Point` class, located in `sympy/physics/vector/point.py`, extend the `vel()` method.
   - Update the method to handle the dynamic computation of velocity based on the time derivative of the position vector if the velocity is not directly available.

Detailed Changes:
1. **`Point.vel()` Logic Update**:
   - Check if `frame` exists in `_vel_dict`.
   - If not found in `_vel_dict`, iterate over `_pos_dict` to find a relationship with another point.
   - Use the position differential to compute the velocity if a relationship is found.
   - Cache the computed velocity in `_vel_dict`.

Summary of the necessary code update in `point.py`:
- Add a try-except structure to compute the velocity when itâ€™s not found in `_vel_dict`.
- The calculation should involve differentiating the position with respect to time considering the input reference frame.
  
By implementing this change, the `Point.vel()` method will be able to calculate the velocity dynamically if the position is defined, making it consistent with how angular velocities are handled in reference frames.

This solution ensures minimal changes to the existing code and leverages SymPy's symbolic computation capabilities to dynamically derive the necessary velocity vectors when needed.
