**Title**: Fix pickling issue with draggable legends in matplotlib figures

**Problem**: When a figure with a draggable legend is pickled, a `TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object` error is encountered. This issue arises because the draggable legend interacts with the figure canvas, which is not picklable.

**Analysis**: The root cause of this problem lies in the interaction between the draggable legend and the figure canvas. When a legend is set to be draggable, it references the figure's canvas, which is a backend-specific object. These objects are inherently non-picklable, leading to the error when attempting to pickle the figure.

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that the draggable functionality of the legend does not hinder the pickling process. This can be achieved by temporarily disabling the draggable property of the legend before pickling and then restoring it afterward.

**Proposed Changes**:

File to be changed: `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`

1. **Modify `Legend` class**:
    - Add methods to temporarily disable and restore the draggable property of the legend. This will allow the legend's draggable state to be reset during the pickling process and restored afterward.
    - Implement the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods to manage the legend's draggable state during pickling.

### Specific changes:

1. **Add methods to manage draggable state**:
    - Add a method to disable the draggable property and store its state.
    - Add a method to restore the draggable property from the stored state.

2. **Implement pickling support in `Legend` class**:
    - Override the `__getstate__` method to disable the draggable property before pickling and remove references to non-picklable objects (such as the canvas).
    - Override the `__setstate__` method to restore the draggable property after unpickling.

These changes will ensure that the draggable legend does not interfere with the pickling process, allowing the figure to be pickled and unpickled successfully.

Feasible changes in `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`:

1. **Add method to disable draggable property**:
    - This method should save the current state of the draggable property and then disable it.

2. **Add method to restore draggable property**:
    - This method should restore the draggable property from the saved state.

3. **Override `__getstate__` method**:
    - This method should call the draggable disable method and remove references to the canvas.

4. **Override `__setstate__` method**:
    - This method should call super to restore the state and then restore the draggable property.

These steps will ensure that figures with draggable legends can be pickled without issues. Be sure to integrate these changes carefully and test extensively to confirm that the pickling and unpickling processes work as expected with draggable legends.
