**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

[Bug]: Unable to pickle figure with draggable legend
### Bug summary

I am unable to pickle figure with draggable legend. Same error comes for draggable annotations.





### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pickle

fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)

time=[0,1,2,3,4]
speed=[40,43,45,47,48]

ax.plot(time,speed,label="speed")

leg=ax.legend()
leg.set_draggable(True) #pickling works after removing this line 

pickle.dumps(fig)
plt.show()
```


### Actual outcome

`TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`

### Expected outcome

Pickling successful

### Additional information

_No response_

### Operating system

Windows 10

### Matplotlib Version

3.7.0

### Matplotlib Backend

_No response_

### Python version... (886)
