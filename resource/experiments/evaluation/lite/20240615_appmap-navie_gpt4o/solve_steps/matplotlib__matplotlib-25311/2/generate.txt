**Title**: Correct Pickling of Figure with Draggable Legend

**Problem**: Attempting to pickle a figure with a draggable legend results in a `TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`. 

**Analysis**: The issue arises because when a legend is made draggable, it attaches the legend to the GUI event system, which involves non-pickleable elements like callbacks and GUI elements. This 'binds' the figure to these GUI components, causing the pickling process to fail. 

To resolve this issue, we need to decouple these non-pickleable components from the figure object during the pickling process.

**Proposed Changes**: 
We must ensure the method used for pickling figures avoids incorporating non-pickleable components. 

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`
    - **Function**: Modify or add methods for handling pickling processes.
    - **Changes**:
        - Introduce a method that temporarily disables interactions associated with the draggable components (like `draggable` Legends) before pickling.
        - Re-enable these interactions post-pickling.

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Add Method to Remove Callbacks**:
    - Introduce a class method to remove all draggable functionality before pickling.
  


2. **Modify Pickle Process**:
    - Integrate the `remove_interactive_components` method within the pickling and unpickling workflows.
  
3. **Example Integration**: 


4. **Persist Changes**:
    - Ensure the additional methods are appropriately called before the pickling attempts and restore the state after pickling is complete.

By implementing these changes, the figure will exclude non-pickleable objects during the pickling process, preventing the `TypeError` and ensuring successful pickling and unpickling, while retaining the desired interactivity in the application lifecycle.

**Files to Modify**:
1. `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`: Add and modify methods to handle draggable and other interactive components during the pickling process. 

Following this plan will address the issue of pickling figures with draggable legends without the `TypeError`.

    Singleton to maintain the relation between figures and their managers, and
    keep track of and "active" figure and manager.

    The canvas of a figure created through pyplot is associated with a figure
    manager, which handles the interaction between the figure and the backend.
    pyplot keeps track of figure managers using an identifier, the "figure
    number" or "manager number" (which can actually be any hashable value);
    this number is available as the :attr:`number` attribute of the manager.

    This class is never instantiated; it consists of an `OrderedDict` mapping
    figure/manager numbers to managers, and a set of class methods that
    manipulate this `OrderedDict`.
