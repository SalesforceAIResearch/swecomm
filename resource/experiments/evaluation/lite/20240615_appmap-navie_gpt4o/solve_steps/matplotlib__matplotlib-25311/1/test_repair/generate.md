Given the provided test errors from `test_pickle` and the corresponding detail from the `legend.py` file, I'll address the necessary fixes while ensuring not to change the intended behavior of the code.

From the test failures, it appears that the pickling (serialization) and unpickling (deserialization) process for the `Legend` objects might have issues, especially with its state management for attributes like `_draggable`.

I will make sure the `Legend` class can be pickled and unpickled correctly by examining how the instance attributes are managed in `__reduce__` and `__setstate__`.

Here's the proposed change to ensure proper pickling/unpickling by handling all necessary attributes correctly:

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">lib/matplotlib/legend.py</file>
<original line-count="15" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class Legend(Artist):
    """
    Place a legend on the axes at location loc.
    """

    def __reduce__(self):
        """Control how the legend is reduced (pickled)."""
        draggable = self._draggable is not None
        if draggable:
            self._draggable.disconnect()
            self._draggable = None
        state = super().__reduce__()
        return state[0], state[1], state[2] + (draggable,)
]]></original>
<modified line-count="15" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class Legend(Artist):
    """
    Place a legend on the axes at location loc.
    """

    def __reduce__(self):
        """Control how the legend is reduced (pickled)."""
        draggable = self._draggable is not None
        if draggable:
            self._draggable.disconnect()
        state = super().__reduce__()
        self._draggable = DraggableLegend(self, update=self._draggable._update) if draggable else None
        return state[0], state[1], state[2] + (draggable,)
]]></modified>
</change>

<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="2">lib/matplotlib/legend.py</file>
<original line-count="7" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
    def __setstate__(self, state):
        """Control how the legend is restored (unpickled)."""
        *_, draggable = state
        super().__setstate__(state)
        if draggable:
            self.set_draggable(True)
]]></original>
<modified line-count="7" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
    def __setstate__(self, state):
        """Control how the legend is restored (unpickled)."""
        *_, draggable = state
        super().__setstate__(state)
        if draggable:
            self.set_draggable(True, update=self._draggable._update if self._draggable else 'loc')
]]></modified>
</change>
```

These modifications ensure that the `_draggable` attribute is correctly reinstated post-unpickling and also properly handled during the reduction process, resolving potential state issues.
