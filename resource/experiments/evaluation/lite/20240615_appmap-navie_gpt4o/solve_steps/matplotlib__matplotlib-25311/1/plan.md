### Title:
Fix pickling of figures with draggable legends

### Problem:
When trying to pickle a Matplotlib figure that contains a draggable legend, a `TypeError` is raised: `cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`. This error also occurs with draggable annotations.

### Analysis:
The root cause of the issue lies in the mechanism used to enable draggability of legends and annotations. When `set_draggable(True)` is called, Matplotlib internally establishes connections to the figure's canvas events, such as mouse motion and button press. These connections involve references to the `FigureCanvas` object, which is not serializable (pickleable).

To solve this, we need to ensure that these non-serializable parts are temporarily disconnected or ignored during the pickling process. Specifically, we can override the `__reduce__` method of the `Legend` class to manage its event connections before pickling. 

### Proposed Changes:
The most relevant file to modify for this fix is `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`. Here's the detailed description of the changes to be made:

1. **lib/matplotlib/legend.py:**

   - Modify the `Legend` class to include custom logic in its `__reduce__` method.
   - The `__reduce__` method should temporarily disable the draggability by disconnecting the event connections and then re-enable it after the figure has been pickled.
   - Ensure that other necessary properties are correctly saved and restored.

#### Detailed Description of Changes:

1. **Override `__reduce__` method in `Legend` class:**
   - Temporarily disable draggability by disconnecting event handlers to make the object picklable.
   - Re-establish the draggability after unpickling.

- **Add the following method in the `Legend` class:**
  
  

This change ensures that:
- The draggable state is temporarily suspended to avoid issues with non-pickleable `FigureCanvas` objects.
- All relevant state information is preserved and can be restored.
- After unpickling, the legend's draggability is restored if it was set to draggable before pickling.

By implementing these changes, users will be able to pickle and unpickle figures with draggable legends without encountering the `TypeError`.
