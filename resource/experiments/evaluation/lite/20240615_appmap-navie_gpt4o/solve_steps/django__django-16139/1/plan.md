**Title:** Fix broken PasswordResetForm link in UserChangeForm when accessed via to_field in UserAdmin

**Problem:**
The link to the PasswordResetForm within the `UserChangeForm` in `UserAdmin` becomes invalid and results in a 404 error when the `UserAdmin` is accessed via another model's Admin that utilizes `to_field` (e.g., `to_field="uuid"`). The issue arises because the `help_text` URL construction assumes that `UserAdmin` is always accessed via its primary key (pk).

**Analysis:**
The root cause of this problem is the construction of the `help_text` URL for changing the user's password. Currently, the code uses:



This relative URL construction fails when `UserAdmin` is accessed via a URL that includes `to_field`, as the expected URL structure changes.

The proposed solution involves changing the URL construction in the `__init__` method of `UserChangeForm` to consider the actual `pk` of the instance, constructing the URL dynamically based on the instance's primary key.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`**
   - **Class: `UserChangeForm`**
     - **Method: `__init__`**
       - Modify the `help_text` URL construction to dynamically use the instance `pk`.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. Locate the `__init__` method within the `UserChangeForm` class.
2. Change the line:
   
   to:
   

By dynamically incorporating the instance's primary key into the URL, the constructed link to the PasswordResetForm will be correct regardless of how the `UserAdmin` is accessed, thus resolving the 404 error.

**Summary:**

- Modify the `__init__` method of `UserChangeForm` in `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` to utilize the instance's `pk` for constructing the `help_text` URL for the password change link.
- This ensures that the link to the PasswordResetForm remains valid even when `UserAdmin` is accessed via `to_field`.

These changes should resolve the broken link issue encountered under the described conditions.
