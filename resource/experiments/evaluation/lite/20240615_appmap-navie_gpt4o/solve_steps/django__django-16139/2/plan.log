**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Accessing UserAdmin via to_field leads to link to PasswordResetForm being broken (404)
Description
	 
		(last modified by Simon Kern)
	 
Accessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that has a reference to User (with to_field set, e.g., to_field="uuid") leads to the UserAdmin being accessed via an url that looks similar to this one:
.../user/22222222-3333-4444-5555-666677778888/change/?_to_field=uuid
However the underlying form looks like this: 
Code highlighting:
class UserChangeForm(forms.ModelForm):
	password = ReadOnlyPasswordHashField(
		label=_("Password"),
		help_text=_(
			"Raw passwords are not stored, so there is no way to see this "
			"user’s password, but you can change the password using "
