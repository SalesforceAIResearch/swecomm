**Title**: Correct Password Reset URL in UserChangeForm for UserAdmin Accesses via to_field

**Problem**:
When accessing the UserAdmin via another model's Admin that references User with a specified `to_field` (e.g., `to_field="uuid"`), the URL constructed for the Password Reset Form becomes incorrect. This leads to a broken link (404 error) for the Password Reset Form. The issue arises due to the hardcoded relative URL in the help text of the `password` field in the `UserChangeForm`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is the assumption that UserAdmin is always accessed via its primary key. The current implementation formats the password reset link using a predefined relative path, which fails when the UserAdmin is accessed through a different path structure. Specifically, the code:

does not account for the `to_field` scenario, where the URL structure needs to navigate two levels up to the userâ€™s primary key, and then to the password reset form.

To fix this, we need to dynamically construct the correct URL by considering the actual instance primary key (PK), ensuring the password reset link will correctly resolve regardless of how the UserAdmin is accessed.

**Proposed Changes**:
The changes should be made in the `django/contrib/auth/forms.py` file where the `UserChangeForm` class is defined:

1. **Update the `__init__` Method in the `UserChangeForm` Class:**

   - Change the relative URL construction for the password reset help text to use the actual instance PK dynamically.

   **Modification**:
   - Locate the `__init__` method of the `UserChangeForm` class.
   - Update the line that formats the `password.help_text` to use `self.instance.pk`.

   **Files to be changed**:
   - `django/contrib/auth/forms.py`

   **Detailed Description**:
   Within the `__init__` method:
   

This modification ensures that the generated URL for the password reset form dynamically adapts to the actual path required based on the instance's PK, thus resolving the 404 error when `UserAdmin` is accessed via `to_field`.
