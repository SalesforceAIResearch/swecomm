**Title**: Fix Inaccurate Rendering of `pi**(1/E)` in Pretty Printing

**Problem**: The rendering of \( \pi^{\frac{1}{e}} \) in Pretty Printing is inaccurate. The current output incorrectly shows as `-1___` with `╲╱ π` beneath it. However, the correct representation should align with LaTeX and string outputs, which are respectively `\pi^{e^{-1}}` and `pi**exp(-1)`.

**Analysis**: The pretty printer renders special characters and mathematical expressions to display them in aesthetically pleasing forms. The misrepresentation of \( \pi^{\frac{1}{e}} \) likely stems from an issue in how the exponentiation involving irrational constants is handled. This discrepancy emerges because the pretty printer incorrectly formats the expression, leading to an inaccurate visual representation.

To correct this, the handling of exponents, specifically when irrational constants like `E` are involved, needs refinement. It appears that the pretty printer fails to recognize the proper form for the base and the exponent in this specific case, defaulting to a generic and erroneous pattern.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`
   - **Modify** the function which handles the printing of exponentiated forms, particularly where it deals with bases and exponents involving irrational numbers like `E`.
     - Ensure the function correctly identifies and formats the exponent as `1/E`.

2. **Function**: `_print_Pow` or a relevant helper method that formats exponentiation.
   - **Logic Adjustment**: Introduce additional logic to detect and correctly format expressions of the form \( \pi^{\frac{1}{E}} \).
     - Check if the base is `pi` and the exponent is `1/E` or its equivalent.
     - Format the output string appropriately to reflect the correct mathematical representation.

These adjustments will resolve the incorrect formatting issue in the pretty printer, ensuring consistency with other output formats like LaTeX and string representations.

Review the functions that handle mathematical expressions printing in the pretty printer to ensure there are no other overlooked formats, achieving a comprehensive and accurate output across all expressions.
