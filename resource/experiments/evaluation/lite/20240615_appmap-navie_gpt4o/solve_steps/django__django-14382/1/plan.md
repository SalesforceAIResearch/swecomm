**Title**: Remove trailing slash from target directory name in django-admin startapp

**Problem**: 
When using bash tab-completion, directory names can be appended with trailing slashes. The `django-admin startapp` command fails when a trailing slash is present, resulting in an error:
`CommandError: '' is not a valid app directory. Please make sure the directory is a valid identifier.` This is because `os.path.basename(target)` does not account for trailing slashes.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the problem is the trailing slash in the target directory path. By default, when `os.path.basename` is called on a path with a trailing slash, it returns an empty string as the basename. This causes the validation method to throw an error, as it interprets the empty string as an invalid directory name.

To solve this issue, we need to strip trailing slashes from the target directory path before calling `os.path.basename`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: django/core/management/templates.py**
   - Find the function where `self.validate_name` is called with `os.path.basename(target)`.
   - Modify this call to first strip any trailing slashes from `target` by using `target.rstrip(os.sep)` and then pass it to `os.path.basename`.

Details:
- Locate the function that contains `self.validate_name(os.path.basename(target), 'directory')`.
- Change the line to:
  - `self.validate_name(os.path.basename(target.rstrip(os.sep)), 'directory')`.

By making the aforementioned change, we ensure that any trailing slashes are removed from the target directory path before validation, thereby preventing the `CommandError` caused by an empty basename.
