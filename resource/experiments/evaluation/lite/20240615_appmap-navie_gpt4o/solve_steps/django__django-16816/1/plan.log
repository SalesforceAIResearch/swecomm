Description
	 
		(last modified by Baha Sdtbekov)
	 
I have two models, Question and Choice. And if I write list_display = ["choice"] in QuestionAdmin, I get no errors.
But when I visit /admin/polls/question/, the following trace is returned:
Internal Server Error: /admin/polls/question/
Traceback (most recent call last):

	raise FieldDoesNotExist()
