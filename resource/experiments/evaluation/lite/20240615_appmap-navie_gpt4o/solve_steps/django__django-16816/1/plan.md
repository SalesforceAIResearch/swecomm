### Update Error Handling in `label_for_field` to Cover More Cases

**Problem**  
The current implementation of the `label_for_field` function does not handle some cases where a field is neither a model field nor an attribute defined in `model_admin`. This leads to an unhandled `AttributeError` when trying to access such fields.

**Analysis**  
The root cause of the issue is that `label_for_field` only checks for the field in the model meta and `model_admin`. It raises an `AttributeError` for any other cases, which leads to a server crash when rendering the admin page. The function should be updated to handle the case when the field is not found in both places gracefully.

**Proposed Changes**  
1. **File**: `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`
   - **Function**: `label_for_field`
   - **Change**: Modify the error handling in the `except FieldDoesNotExist` block to account for cases when `name` is not found in both the model fields and `model_admin` attributes.
   
### Detailed Steps
1. **Update Exception Handling for `FieldDoesNotExist`**
   - Modify the `except FieldDoesNotExist` block to check for attributes defined in `model_admin`.
   - If `name` is neither a callable nor an attribute in `model_admin`, raise a custom error message indicating that the field could not be found in either.

**Changes to be made in `label_for_field` function**:
1. Modify the `except FieldDoesNotExist` block:
   - Check if `name` is callable.
   - Check if `name` is an attribute in `model_admin`.
   - Raise a descriptive error message if neither condition is met, indicating the source of the problem.

By implementing these changes, `label_for_field` will handle more cases gracefully, preventing server crashes when encountering undefined fields in `list_display`.

### Final Modified Exception Block in `label_for_field`:
Here's the logic that you should add to the function:

- If `name` is a callable, set `attr = name`.
- If `model_admin` has an attribute `name`, set `attr = getattr(model_admin, name)`.
- If both conditions fail, raise an informative `AttributeError`.

This way, `label_for_field` will be more robust and capable of handling unexpected scenarios gracefully.



### Summary
- Addressed unhandled `AttributeError` in `label_for_field`.
- Enhanced error handling to check for more conditions (callables and attributes in `model_admin`).
- Raised a custom error message to indicate the source of the issue when neither condition is met.

By implementing these changes, the `label_for_field` function will become more resilient, preventing internal server errors when encountering undefined fields in `list_display`.
