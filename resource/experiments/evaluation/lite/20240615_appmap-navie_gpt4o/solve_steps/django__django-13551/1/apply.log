    Hash the user's primary key and some user state that's sure to change
    after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it's
    used:
    1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
       same password is chosen, due to password salting).
    2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after
       a password reset.
    Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
    invalidates the token.
