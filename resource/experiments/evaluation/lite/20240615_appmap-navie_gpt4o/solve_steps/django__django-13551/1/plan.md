**Title**: Modify PasswordResetTokenGenerator to Include User's Email in _make_hash_value

**Problem**: 
Currently, when a user requests a password reset and subsequently changes their email address, the password reset token generated earlier remains valid. This can pose a security risk as someone could potentially use the old token to reset the password even after an email address change. The root cause is that the current token generation process does not account for changes in the user's email.

**Analysis**:
- The token is generated using the method `_make_hash_value` in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class.
- The `_make_hash_value` method currently uses only the user's primary key, password, and some user state to create the token.
- By including the user's email in the token generation process, any change to the email will invalidate the previously generated tokens.
- The `AbstractBaseUser` class doesn't enforce the presence of an email field, so a conditional check would be necessary to handle users without an email address.

**Proposed Changes**:
File: `django/contrib/auth/tokens.py`

1. **Modify `_make_hash_value` Method**:
   - Update the `_make_hash_value` method in the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email.
   - Add a conditional check to include the email only if the user has set an email address.

Detailed changes to be made:
1. In the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class:
   - Locate the method `_make_hash_value`.
   - Modify this method to integrate the email address in the hash value.

2. **Example Change**:
   - Current `_make_hash_value` method:
     
   - Updated `_make_hash_value` method:
     

By integrating the user's email into the token generation, any subsequent email address changes will render the previous tokens invalid, thus enhancing the security.

Make sure to test these changes extensively in different scenarios, especially when the user does not have an email set.
