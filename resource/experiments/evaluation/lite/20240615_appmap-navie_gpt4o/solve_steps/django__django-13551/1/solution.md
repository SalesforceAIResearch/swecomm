Based on the issue description provided, let's implement the necessary changes to the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class to include the user's email when generating the hash value. This will make the token invalid if the email address is changed after generating a token.

Here are the changes:

1. Update the `_make_hash_value` method to include the user's email address, considering the possibility that the user might not have an email address set.

Let's proceed with the code modification:

```xml
<change>
    <file change-number-for-this-file="1">django/contrib/auth/tokens.py</file>
    <original line-count="14" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):
    """
    Hash the user's primary key and some user state that's sure to change
    after a password reset to produce a token that invalidated when it's
    used:
    1. The password field will change upon a password reset (even if the
       same password is chosen, due to password salting).
    2. The last_login field will usually be updated very shortly after
       a password reset.
    Failing those things, settings.PASSWORD_RESET_TIMEOUT eventually
    invalidates the token.

    Running this data through salted_hmac() prevents password cracking
    attempts using the reset token, provided the secret isn't compromised.
    """
    # Truncate microseconds so that tokens are consistent even if the
    # database doesn't support microseconds.
    login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)
    return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)
]]></original>
    <modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[

    """

    email_field = '' if user.email is None else user.email
    return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp) + email_field
]]></modified>
</change>
```

### Unit Test Changes
Since the `PasswordResetTokenGenerator` class is critical, we should cover the new functionality with tests. Let's create a test to ensure that the token becomes invalid if the user's email is changed.

We'll need to add a test file if it doesn't already exist, or modify the existing test file to include our new tests.

Here's an example of what the test could look like:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.contrib.auth.tokens import PasswordResetTokenGenerator

class PasswordResetTokenGeneratorTest(TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.user = User.objects.create_user(username='testuser', email='test@example.com', password='password')
        self.token_generator = PasswordResetTokenGenerator()

    def test_token_invalid_after_email_change(self):
        token = self.token_generator.make_token(self.user)
        self.user.email = 'newemail@example.com'
        self.user.save()
        self.assertFalse(self.token_generator.check_token(self.user, token))

    def test_token_valid_before_email_change(self):
        token = self.token_generator.make_token(self.user)
        self.assertTrue(self.token_generator.check_token(self.user, token))

if __name__ == "__main__":
    TestCase.main()
```

This test will ensure that the modification to include the email address in the token generation is correctly invalidating the token when the email changes and preserving it otherwise.
