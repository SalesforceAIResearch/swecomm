**Title**: Fix `autosummary` module template to exclude imported members when `autosummary_imported_members` is False

**Problem**:
The `autosummary` extension includes imported members in the generated documentation for modules, even when the configuration option `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`. This results in the unnecessary documentation of imported items, which contradicts the user settings.

**Analysis**:
The core issue lies in how the `members` variable is populated for the module template. Currently, there is no check to filter out imported members based on the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration option. The logic responsible for filling the `members` list should be modified to respect this setting.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`, imported members are excluded from the `members` list.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py**:
    - Modify the logic inside `generate_autosummary_docs` function to filter out imported members if `app.config.autosummary_imported_members` is `False`.
    - Update the context within `generate_autosummary_content` function to enforce the `autosummary_imported_members` setting.

### Detailed Changes:

1. **sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py**:
    - In the `generate_autosummary_docs` function, before members are added to the `members` list, add a conditional check to verify if `app.config.autosummary_imported_members` is false. If so, exclude the imported members.

2. **sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py**:
    - Within the `generate_autosummary_content` function, ensure that the context passed to the template correctly reflects the exclusion of imported members based on the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration.

By making these changes, the `members` list passed to the module template will exclude imported members when the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is false, thereby respecting user configuration and fixing the reported bug.
