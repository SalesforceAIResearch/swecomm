**Title**: Modify `generate_autosummary_docs` to Exclude Imported Members When `autosummary_imported_members` is False

**Problem**: 
The `members` variable for module templates contains imported members even when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False` in the configuration. As a result, the generated documentation erroneously includes names of imported members like `os` in the autosummary table.

**Analysis**: 
The crux of the issue lies in the function `generate_autosummary_content` and its invocation within `generate_autosummary_docs`. The `generate_autosummary_docs` function is responsible for generating autosummary documentation, and it calls `generate_autosummary_content` to get the content for each module. 

Currently, it appears that the filtration logic for excluding imported members is either missing or not properly implemented within these functions.

To resolve the issue:
1. Modify the `generate_autosummary_docs` function to check the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration value.
2. Ensure the `generate_autosummary_content` function considers this configuration and filters out imported members accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**: 
1. **sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py**:
    - In the `generate_autosummary_docs` function, before processing the members, check if `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`. 
    - Based on the configuration value, adjust the `generate_autosummary_content` function to exclude members that are imported.

Detailed changes:
- **sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py**:
  - In the `generate_autosummary_docs` function, introduce logic to filter out imported members based on the `autosummary_imported_members` setting.
  - Adjust the output generation logic to adhere to this filtration.

Changes to `generate_autosummary_docs`:
1. **Incorporate checks for `autosummary_imported_members`**:
    - Fetch the configuration value for `autosummary_imported_members`.
    - If `autosummary_imported_members` is `False`, revise the `get_items` logic to exclude imported members.

2. **Adjust `generate_autosummary_content` logic**:
   - Ensure this function respects the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration when assembling the list of members.

Modification Steps:
1. Add a line to fetch the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration.
2. Update the logic inside `generate_autosummary_content` to exclude imported members if `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`.

By incorporating these checks and logic modifications, the `members` variable for module templates should exclude imported members as expected when the configuration is set to do so.
