**Title**: Filter imported members from `members` variable in module template when `autosummary_imported_members` is False

**Problem**: 
The `members` variable used in the autosummary module template contains imported members even when the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration option is set to `False`. This results in the output including imported members which should be excluded based on the configuration.

**Analysis**: 
The issue lies in the logic used to populate the `members` variable in the `autosummary` directive. When `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`, imported members should be filtered out before rendering the autosummary content. The `generate_autosummary_content` function should be updated to check the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration option and exclude imported members accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**: 

1. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`

   - **Function**: `generate_autosummary_content`

     Description: Modify this function to check the `autosummary_imported_members` configuration option and exclude imported members if the option is set to `False`.
     
     Suggested change:
     - After fetching the members and documenting them, filter the list based on the `autosummary_imported_members` flag.

     

     - Implement the helper function `is_imported_member` that takes a member and determines if it is an imported member.

     

By making these changes, the `members` variable will only include members defined in the module itself when `autosummary_imported_members` is set to `False`, thus resolving the issue.
