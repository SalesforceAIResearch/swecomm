### Prevent crashes in `format_cursor_data` when `BoundaryNorm` is used

**Problem:**
The `format_cursor_data` method crashes when the mouse hovers over an image normalized using `BoundaryNorm` because `BoundaryNorm` is not invertible, raising a `ValueError`. This interrupts the interaction with the plot.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of this issue is that `BoundaryNorm` does not have an `inverse` method, making it impossible to map normalized values back to the original data values. This limitation needs to be handled within the `format_cursor_data` method to prevent the application from crashing. There are a few ways to handle this:
1. **Special Check**: Add a check to see if the `norm` used is `BoundaryNorm` and handle it accordingly.
2. **Try-Except Block**: Use a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` and handle it without crashing.
3. **Approximate Inversion**: Implement an approximate inversion for `BoundaryNorm`.

For simplicity and minimal impact, we will add a special check for `BoundaryNorm` and handle it appropriately.

**Proposed Changes:**
To solve the issue, we need to modify the `format_cursor_data` method within the most relevant file. In this case, it appears to be in the `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` file based on the provided error logs.

1. **Modify `format_cursor_data` method**:
   - Add a check to determine if the `norm` is an instance of `BoundaryNorm`.
   - If `BoundaryNorm` is detected, gracefully handle it by either not performing the inversion or providing a placeholder message.
   - Ensure that other norm types are unaffected.

This will prevent the `ValueError` from being raised and allow the interaction to continue smoothly.

**Proposed Changes to Files:**

**File to be changed:**
- **Location**: `lib/matplotlib/artist.py`

**Changes:**
1. **Modify the `format_cursor_data` method:**
   - Identify the lines where normalization is being applied and checked.
   - Add a conditional to check if the norm is an instance of `BoundaryNorm`.
   - Handle it by either skipping the inversion step or providing an alternative way to format the cursor data.

**Detailed Description:**
- Locate the `format_cursor_data` method in `artist.py`.
- Inside this method, add a check:
  
- Place this check before any calls to `self.norm.inverse`.

By implementing these changes, we handle the specific case where `BoundaryNorm` is used, avoiding crashes and ensuring smooth interaction.
