**Title**: Add check for BoundaryNorm in ScalarMappable's format_cursor_data

**Problem**: 
When using a `BoundaryNorm` with a `ScalarMappable` object and attempting to mouse over the image in Matplotlib, it causes a crash due to the `BoundaryNorm` not being invertible. This is due to the automatic attempt of the `norm.inverse` method in the `format_cursor_data` method of `ScalarMappable`.

**Analysis**: 
The `BoundaryNorm` class in `matplotlib.colors` is designed to map data values to discrete colors, but it does not support inversion, meaning it cannot provide an approximate value from a normalized color value back to the original data value. When the `format_cursor_data` method tries to call the `norm.inverse` method on a `BoundaryNorm` instance, it triggers a `ValueError` and crashes the application. 
To resolve this issue, the code should include a check to ensure that `norm.inverse` is only called if the norm type supports inversion. If the norm doesn't support inversion, a suitable fallback should be used, such as returning the input value or raising a handled exception with a meaningful message.

**Proposed Changes**:
The file that needs to be changed is `lib/matplotlib/cm.py` within the `ScalarMappable` class, particularly within the `format_cursor_data` method.

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`
   
   - **Function**: `format_cursor_data`
     - **Change**: Modify the `format_cursor_data` function to check if the norm object supports inversion before attempting to call the `inverse` method. If the inversion is not supported (as in the case of `BoundaryNorm`), handle the situation gracefully by either providing a default formatted value or an appropriate message.

   **Proposed modification**:
   - Locate the `format_cursor_data` method within the `ScalarMappable` class.
   - Before calling `self.norm.inverse`, add a check to determine if the norm object has an `inverse` method and if it supports inversion without raising an exception.
   - If `self.norm` does not support inversion, handle the case by returning a meaningful default value or message.

Here's a brief outline of the changes:

1. Open the `lib/matplotlib/cm.py` file.
2. Locate the `ScalarMappable` class.
3. Find the `format_cursor_data` method within this class.
4. Update the method to include a check for the invertibility of `self.norm`.

If `self.norm` is an instance of `BoundaryNorm` (or generally if `inverse` method is unavailable), simply return the input value or an appropriate message instead of calling `inverse`.

This way, the code avoids attempting to invert a `BoundaryNorm`, thus preventing the program from crashing.
