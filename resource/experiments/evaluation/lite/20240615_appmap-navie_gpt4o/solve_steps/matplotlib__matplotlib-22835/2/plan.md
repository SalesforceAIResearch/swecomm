**Title**: Handle BoundaryNorm non-invertibility in format_cursor_data

**Problem**:  
When using a `BoundaryNorm` to normalize data in Matplotlib and hovering over an image, the function `format_cursor_data` attempts to call an `inverse` method on the `BoundaryNorm`. Since `BoundaryNorm` is not invertible, this raises a `ValueError` and causes interaction to stop, leading to a crash.

**Analysis**:  
The issue arises because the `format_cursor_data` method expects that all normalization objects will have a meaningful `inverse` method. However, for `BoundaryNorm`, this is not the case. The root cause is the absence of a check for non-invertible normalization objects in the `format_cursor_data` method before calling their `inverse` method.

To fix this issue, there are a few potential approaches:
1. **Special Check**: Modify `format_cursor_data` to detect if the norm is an instance of `BoundaryNorm` and handle it accordingly.
2. **Try-Except Block**: Surround the `inverse` call with a try-except block to handle the `ValueError` gracefully.
3. **Approximate Inverse for BoundaryNorm**: This is more complex and would involve implementing an approximate inverse function for `BoundaryNorm`.

The simplest and most maintainable approach would be to add a try-except block around the `inverse` call to handle the specific case where the norm is not invertible.

**Proposed Changes**:  
Modify the `format_cursor_data` method in the `ScalarMappable` class, located in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`, to handle the non-invertibility of `BoundaryNorm`. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Identify the location in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`** where the `format_cursor_data` method is defined.
2. **Add a try-except block around the call to the `inverse` method** on the normalization object. Specifically, catch the `ValueError` raised for `BoundaryNorm` and provide an alternative way to format the cursor data or handle the exception gracefully.

**Detailed Changes**:

- Locate the `format_cursor_data` method within the `ScalarMappable` class in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`.
- Add a try-except block to handle the `ValueError` when `norm.inverse` is not callable.

Hereâ€™s how the modification will be structured:

1. **File to change**: `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`
2. **Function to modify**: `format_cursor_data` within `ScalarMappable` class

**Modifications**:

- Add a try-except block around `self.norm.inverse` to catch `ValueError`.
- Implement alternative handling for cases where the norm is not invertible.

This will prevent the function from crashing and allow the interaction to continue smoothly even when using `BoundaryNorm`.

**Testing and Validation**:
- Validate the change by using the provided example code to ensure that hovering over the image no longer crashes the application.
- Verify that the exception is handled gracefully and that the cursor data is either not displayed or displayed in a fallback manner when a `BoundaryNorm` is used.

By implementing these changes, the application will handle non-invertible normalization gracefully, thus preventing crashes and maintaining user interaction.
