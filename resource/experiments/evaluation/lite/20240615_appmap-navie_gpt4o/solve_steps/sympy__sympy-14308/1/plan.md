**Title**: Fix Pretty Printing of Vectors and Adjust Baseline Centering

**Problem**
The pretty printing of vectors in SymPy's vector package is broken. When trying to print an expression like \((\frac{x}{y})^t \cdot e_j\), the expected output format is not achieved. Additionally, the baseline of the generated vector pretty print is misplaced; it should be centered but isn't.

**Analysis**
Pretty printing in SymPy is handled via custom print dispatch functions that are tailored to each class. The issue likely resides within the `_pretty` method responsible for creating the formatted string representation. Furthermore, the problem might pertain to how the `Vector` class interacts with the internal pretty print framework, especially in terms of how these expressions are encapsulated and displayed. The centering issue suggests that while assembling the pretty print components, the alignment might not be set correctly.

**Proposed Changes**
1. **`_pretty` method in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py` (lines 214-217)**:
   - Verify if it's correctly formatting vector expressions.
   - Ensure that the `prettyForm` assembly uses the correct alignment settings to place vector components centrally.

2. **Investigate and potentially adjust**:
   - **`VectorPrettyPrinter` class** in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`:
     - This class might be where the assembly logic for pretty printing vectors is handled. Ensure it appropriately constructs the pretty print structure for vectors.
     - Focus on how power and vector unit notations (like `e_j`) are formatted and combined.
     - Validate the baseline centering logic.

### Specific Instructions

1. **Modify `_pretty` method** in `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`:
   - Ensure the method correctly differentiates between various inputs like powers and fractions.
   - Use the `prettyForm` class to build parts of the expression and ensure they are combined with correct alignment parameters.

2. **Adjust `VectorPrettyPrinter` class**:
   - Review how `VectorPrettyPrinter` formats vector basis elements and ensure that symbols, fractions, and powers are handled correctly.
   - Validate that all components are centrally aligned using `prettyForm`. Ensure that `prettyForm(*prettyExpr).Mul()` and similar methods incorporate baseline centering.

### Detailed Changes

1. **File: `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`**
   - Modify the `_pretty` method:
     - Ensure proper use of `prettyForm` for combining expressions.
     - Use alignment parameters to ensure components are centrally aligned.
2. **File: `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`**
   - Review and adjust logic for pretty printing vectors:
     - Ensure fraction and power expressions are correctly formatted and combined.
     - Ensure baseline centering and alignment are correctly set.

By following these steps, the pretty printing for vectors should be fixed, and the output should be visually centered and correctly formatted.
