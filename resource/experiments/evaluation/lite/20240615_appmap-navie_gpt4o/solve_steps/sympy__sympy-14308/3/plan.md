**Title**: Fix Pretty Printing and Baseline Alignment for Vectors

**Problem**: 

Vectors in the `sympy.vector` module break pretty printing. The output for `(x/y)**t*e.j` is incorrectly formatted, with multiple `e_j` terms appearing. Additionally, even when the output is correctly printed, the baseline alignment for vector notation is wrong and should be centered.

**Analysis**:

The issue seems to be related to the pretty printing logic handling vectors in the SymPy library. Specifically, how vector constituents are formatted and aligned when generating the string representation for pretty printing.

The root problem lies in the `_pretty` method of the `Vector` class within the appropriate vector module (such as `sympy.vector.vector.py`). This method is responsible for the pretty printing logic, and thus is the ideal candidate for modification.

**Proposed Changes**:

File: `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`

1. **Modify `_pretty` Method**:
    - Update the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class (or the relevant pretty printer class) to correctly handle the format of vector components within expressions.
    - Ensure that the `prettyForm` objects representing different components of the vector are correctly combined without duplicating vectors.
    - Ensure the baseline of the vector representation is correctly aligned to be centered, which might involve adjusting how `prettyForm` objects are rendered and combined.

2. **Ensure Correct Handling of Parentheses**:
    - Review and potentially modify how parentheses are handled within the pretty printing logic to ensure they are correctly formatted for both scalar and vector components.

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Update VectorPrettyPrinter class**:
    - Locate the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class within `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`.
    - Modify the `_print_Vector` method to handle the proper formatting of vector components.
    - Ensure the new representation correctly concatenates vector elements and maintains proper baseline alignment.

2. **Adjust Formatting Logic in _pretty Method**:
    - Inside the `_pretty` method within `sympy/physics/vector/vector.py`, ensure that components are properly formatted using `prettyForm`.
    - Verify that the correct mathematical visual structure is maintained when components involve expressions like `(x/y)**t`.

3. **Testing**:
    - While not modifying the test files directly, ensure to instruct users to verify the changes with appropriate pretty-printed expressions to validate that both the format and baseline are fixed.

By concentrating adjustments on the `_pretty` method logic and vector component handling within `VectorPrettyPrinter`, we aim to address both the duplicate vector issues and baseline misalignment, ensuring robust and visually accurate pretty printing for vectors in SymPy.

These adjustments should ensure that vector pretty printing in SymPy functions correctly and maintains appropriate alignment and formatting.
