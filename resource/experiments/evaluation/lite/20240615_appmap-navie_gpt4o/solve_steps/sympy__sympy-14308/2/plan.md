**Title**: Fix pretty printing of vector expressions and correct baseline alignment

**Problem**:
The current pretty printing function in the SymPy vector module produces incorrect output for vector expressions, breaking the visual formatting. Additionally, even when the output is somewhat correct, the baseline alignment is incorrect and should be centered.

**Analysis**:
The pretty printing issue arises when the `__pretty__` method for vectors is not properly handling the display of expressions involving vectors. Currently, the method does not correctly format the output for vector expressions such as `(x/y)**t*e.j`. Additionally, the baseline alignment problem is related to how the text rendering positions the vector components relative to each other.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Ensure the vector expressions are properly formatted in the `__pretty__` method.
2. Adjust the baseline alignment so that it is centered.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify `sympy/vector/vector.py` to address the issues with pretty printing.

1. **Modify `sympy/vector/vector.py` - `_pretty` method**:
   - Ensure that the pretty-printed output is correctly formatted for expressions involving vectors.
   - Adjust the alignment to ensure the baseline is centered.

Here are the detailed steps to modify the `_pretty` method in `sympy/vector/vector.py`:

1. Locate the `_pretty` method within `sympy/vector/vector.py`.
2. Update the method to handle the formatting of vector expressions correctly:
    - Ensure expressions such as `(x/y)**t*e.j` are displayed correctly without breaking the format.
3. Add logic to adjust the baseline alignment, centering it for better visual display.

By making these changes, vector expressions such as `(x/y)**t*e.j` should be correctly formatted, and their baseline should be centered.

**Affected code**:
`sympy/vector/vector.py`

**Detailed Changes**:
- Update the `_pretty` method to better handle vector-specific formatting.
- Adjust the text rendering logic to ensure the centered baseline alignment.

With these changes, the pretty printing of vectors should work as expected, providing correctly formatted and aligned visual output.
