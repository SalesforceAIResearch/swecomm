**Title**: Fix intermittent "ValueError: embedded null byte" in StatReloader by gracefully handling invalid paths

**Problem**:
The auto-reloading functionality in Django's `StatReloader` intermittently throws a `ValueError: embedded null byte`. The issue seems related to the use of Pathlib when iterating through watched files, which occasionally encounters and fails on paths containing embedded null bytes.

**Analysis**:
The issue stems from Pathlib's inability to handle paths that contain embedded null bytes, resulting in a `ValueError`. This issue is intermittent and difficult to reproduce because it may depend on external factors like filesystems or mount points, particularly network shares that may not always be connected. This specific problem appears during the auto-reloading process when `StatReloader` tries to resolve paths within the directories being watched.

The root cause is likely the use of Pathlib's `resolve` method without handling paths that contain invalid characters, such as embedded null bytes.

**Proposed Changes**:
The most relevant file to modify is `django/utils/autoreload.py`. The solution involves adding a try-except block around the problematic Pathlib operations to catch `ValueError` and potentially log it without failing whole operation.

1. **Modify `iter_modules_and_files` function (around line 132):**
   - Add a try-except block to handle `ValueError` when calling `path.resolve().absolute()`.
   - Log the error for debugging purposes and continue processing other files.

Here is a detailed description of the necessary changes:

- **django/utils/autoreload.py:**
  
  - Modify the `iter_modules_and_files` function:
    - Add a try-except block to catch `ValueError` within the loop that processes file paths.
    - Log an error message indicating the problematic file.
    - Continue the loop to ensure remaining files are processed.

The function `iter_modules_and_files` (around line 132) should be adjusted to:

- Try to resolve the path using `path.resolve(strict=True).absolute()`.
- Catch `ValueError` if itâ€™s raised.
- Log the caught error with appropriate details.
- Skip the problematic path and continue processing other files.

This approach ensures the `ValueError` is handled gracefully and the auto-reloader continues functioning without being disrupted by invalid paths. Additionally, logging the error will help in further debugging and tracking occurrences of such issues.

By implementing these changes, we aim to mitigate the intermittent `ValueError` issue without the need to replace Pathlib or other major architectural changes.
