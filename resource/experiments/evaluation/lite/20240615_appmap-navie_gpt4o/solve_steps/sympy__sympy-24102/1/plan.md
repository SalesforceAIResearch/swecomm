**Title**: Enhance `parse_mathematica` to Support Greek Characters and Other Unicode Characters

**Problem**: 
The `parse_mathematica` function in the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module fails to handle Greek characters, which were previously supported by the deprecated `mathematica` function. When attempting to parse a string containing Greek characters using `parse_mathematica`, a `SyntaxError` is raised.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue is likely related to the tokenizer used by `MathematicaParser`, which does not recognize Greek characters or other Unicode characters as valid tokens. The current implementation might be limited to ASCII characters, thus failing when encountering non-ASCII characters like Greek letters.

To fix this, we need to update the tokenizer to recognize Greek letters and possibly other Unicode characters. This can be done by modifying the `_literal` regex pattern within the `MathematicaParser` class to include Unicode character ranges that cover Greek letters and other commonly used symbols.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **sympy/parsing/mathematica.py**
   - Modify the `MathematicaParser` class's `_literal` regex pattern to include Greek characters and possibly other Unicode characters.

### Detailed Description of Changes:
In the `MathematicaParser` class, locate the `_literal` regex pattern, which currently is:


1. **Update `_literal` to Include Greek Characters**:
   Modify the regex to cover Unicode ranges that include Greek characters. The modified regex pattern should look something like:

- `[A-Za-z\u0370-\u03FF_]`: This will match a starting letter which can be any uppercase or lowercase ASCII letter, any Greek letter (Unicode range `\u0370` to `\u03FF`), or an underscore.
- `[A-Za-z0-9\u0370-\u03FF_]*`: This will match any subsequent characters that can be letters, digits, Greek letters, or underscores.

We may also want to update other regex patterns in the parser if they explicitly limit the character set to ASCII.

**File**: `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py`

- Locate the `MathematicaParser` class.
- Identify the `_literal` attribute.
- Modify the `_literal` regex pattern to include Greek and other Unicode characters.

After making this change, the `parse_mathematica` function should be capable of correctly parsing and handling string inputs containing Greek characters and potentially other Unicode symbols.
