**Title**: Modify `parse_mathematica` to Support Greek Characters in Input

**Problem**:
`parse_mathematica` in the `sympy.parsing.mathematica` module fails to correctly parse Greek characters (and possibly others) that the deprecated `mathematica` function handled without issue. Attempts to parse a Greek character (e.g., 'Î»') result in a `SyntaxError`.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises due to the current implementation of the `parse_mathematica` function and its dependent parser class, `MathematicaParser`. The likely root cause is the tokenizer's inability to handle Greek characters properly.

The `MathematicaParser` utilizes a regular expression-based tokenizer to convert Mathematica expressions into token lists as part of its three-stage parsing process. The regular expressions and tokenization logic appear to be focused on ASCII characters and common mathematical symbols, which may lead to the exclusion of Greek characters and other Unicode symbols.

To resolve this issue, the tokenization process needs to be extended to recognize Greek characters and any other necessary Unicode symbols.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py` to update the tokenizer of the `MathematicaParser` class to include support for Greek characters and possibly other Unicode symbols. Specifically:

1. **Update Tokenizer Regular Expression**:
   - Locate the `MathematicaParser` class and identify the `_literal` attribute, which contains the regular expression pattern used for tokenizing identifiers.
   - Extend the `_literal` pattern to include Unicode character ranges, specifically for Greek characters.

2. **Example Changes**:
   - Modify `_literal` to recognize Greek characters:
     
   This change will allow identifiers to start with both Latin and Greek alphabet characters and be followed by any combination of alphanumeric characters.

3. **Validate Character Handling**:
   - Ensure other parts of the tokenizer and parser can handle the extended character set without issues.

4. **Ensure Comprehensive Tests**:
   - Given that the modification itself should not touch test files as per requirements, ensure that code within the system actually tests the parsing of Greek characters implicitly.

The specific changes in `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py`:

- **File: `sympy/parsing/mathematica.py`**:
  - Locate the `MathematicaParser` class declaration.
  - Update the `_literal` attribute to include Greek characters.

By addressing these, `parse_mathematica` should correctly parse inputs containing Greek characters as the deprecated `mathematica` function did.
