**Title**: Log exceptions handled in Signal.send_robust()

**Problem**:
The `Signal.send_robust()` method in Django does not log any exceptions that are raised by receivers of the signal. This omission makes it challenging for users to identify and diagnose issues using error monitoring tools.

**Analysis**:
The `Signal.send_robust()` method is designed to send signals to connected receivers while catching exceptions. However, unlike other parts of Django that log exceptions (like handling missing template variables), `send_robust()` does not log the exceptions it catches. Adding a log entry for each exception would help users to track and resolve issues more effectively.

To log these exceptions, the `logger.exception()` method can be employed. This method captures the current exception information and logs it, making it available for error monitoring tools such as Sentry.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`
   
   - **Function**: `send_robust` (around line 204)
   - **Changes**: 
     - Import the logging module at the top of the file.
     - Add a `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)` call to obtain a logger.
     - Modify the `except` clause within `send_robust` to include `logger.exception()`.

**Detailed Changes**:
1. **Add Import Statement**:
   At the top of `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, add:
   - `import logging` to import the logging module.

2. **Initialize Logger**:
   Near the top of the `Signal` class, initialize the logger:
   - `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`

3. **Modify Exception Handling**:
   Within the `send_robust` method, update the exception handling block in the following way:
   - Locate the `for receiver in self._live_receivers(sender):` loop.
   - In the `except Exception as err:` block, add `logger.exception(f"Exception occurred in receiver {receiver}")` before appending the exception to the responses list.

This enhancement logs exceptions raised in signal receivers, giving developers insights into errors for debugging purposes.

By making these modifications, users will now be able to see any exceptions raised in signal receivers in their log files, greatly improving traceability and diagnostics.
