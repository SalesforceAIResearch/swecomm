**Title: Add exception logging in `Signal.send_robust()` method**

**Problem:**
The `Signal.send_robust()` method in Django does not log exceptions raised by receivers. This lack of logging makes it difficult for developers to detect and handle errors that occur during signal processing. While exceptions are caught and returned with their respective receivers, they are not logged, preventing the use of monitoring tools like Sentry to track such issues seamlessly.

**Analysis:**
The method `send_robust()` in the `Signal` class is designed to send signals to all connected receivers and catch any exceptions that occur during the process. However, unlike other parts of Django which log exceptions (such as missing template variables), `send_robust()` does not log these exceptions. This omission reduces the visibility of errors encountered by signal handlers, making debugging more complex.

The solution involves adding a logging call within the `except` block of the `send_robust()` method. This logging call will use `logger.exception()` to record any exceptions that occur, providing developers with the necessary information to diagnose and address issues.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File to Change:** `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`

2. **Function to Modify:** 
   - `Signal.send_robust(self, sender, **named)`

3. **Changes Required:**
   - Import the `logging` module if not already imported.
   - Add a logger instance for the `django.dispatch` namespace.
   - Within the `except` block of the `send_robust()` method, add a `logger.exception()` call to log the exception.

**Detailed Modifications:**

1. **Import the logging module:** At the beginning of the file `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, ensure that the `logging` module is imported.
   
2. **Logger Initialization:** Initialize a logger instance for the `django.dispatch` namespace. This can be done at the top of the file after imports.

   

3. **Modify the `send_robust` method:** 
   - Within the `except` block of the `send_robust` method, add a `logger.exception()` call to log the caught exception. 

   

By performing these modifications in `django/dispatch/dispatcher.py`, any exceptions raised during the execution of signal receivers in the `send_robust()` method will be logged. This approach provides improved visibility and facilitates monitoring and debugging efforts.
