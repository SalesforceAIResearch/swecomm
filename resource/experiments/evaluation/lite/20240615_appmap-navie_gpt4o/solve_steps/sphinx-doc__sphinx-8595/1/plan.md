**Title**: Fix autodoc to respect empty `__all__` attribute and show no members

**Problem**

When the `__all__` attribute is defined but empty in a module, autodoc should not document any module-level objects. Currently, using the directive `.. automodule:: example :members:` in `index.rst` on a module with an empty `__all__` still lists all module-level objects.

**Analysis**

The `__all__` attribute is conventionally used to define the public API of a module. When `__all__` is present and empty, it indicates that no module-level object should be exposed. The current autodoc implementation seems to ignore this case, leading to unintended documentation of all objects.

The primary cause is likely a missing or incorrect check when processing the module members in the autodoc code. Specifically, we need to ensure that the `get_module_members` function, which retrieves members of the target module, respects the `__all__` attribute correctly.

To fix this, we need to modify the logic to:
1. Check if `__all__` is defined and empty.
2. Skip adding members if `__all__` is empty.

**Proposed Changes**

Make changes in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` file.

1. **Modify `get_module_members` function**:
   Update this function to check if `__all__` exists and is empty. If so, return an empty list of members.

   - Locate the function `get_module_members(module: Any) -> List[Tuple[str, Any]]`.
   - Add logic to check if `__all__` is present and empty before iterating over the module's members.
   - If `__all__` is empty, return an empty list immediately.

**Detailed Steps**:

1. Open `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py`.
2. In the `get_module_members` function, after the initial imports, add a check for `__all__`:
   
   
3. Ensure the function properly handles cases where `__all__` is non-existent or non-empty by preserving the existing logic for those cases.

4. Test the changes by setting up the described scenario in the problem statement and verifying that no members are documented when `__all__` is empty.

This minimal set of changes will address the problem while maintaining the overall behavior of Sphinx's autodoc functionality.
