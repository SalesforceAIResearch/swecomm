### Title
Handle empty `__all__` attribute in autodoc

### Problem
When using the `sphinx.ext.autodoc` extension with an empty `__all__` attribute in a module, all module members (`foo`, `bar`, and `baz` in this case) are currently documented. The expected behavior is that no entries should be shown if `__all__` is empty.

### Analysis
The issue arises because the `autodoc` extension does not currently check whether the `__all__` attribute is empty. Instead, it proceeds to document all members of the module. The `autodoc` extension should verify whether `__all__` is empty and, if so, exclude all members from the documentation.

### Proposed Changes
Modify the autodoc extension code in the most relevant file to handle the case where `__all__` exists but is empty. Ensure that no module members are documented in this case.

1. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`
   - Locate the part of the code where `__all__` is processed.
   - Add a condition to check if `__all__` attribute is an empty list or tuple.
   - If `__all__` is empty, set the list of members to be documented to an empty list.

### Detailed Steps and Modifications
1. **Check for `__all__` in Module**
   - Identify where the `__all__` attribute of a module is fetched and processed (typically within the initialization or setup phase of the `autodoc` extension).

2. **Handle Empty `__all__`**
   - Apply a condition to verify if the fetched `__all__` attribute is an empty list or tuple. If it is empty, ensure that no members of the module are included in the documentation list.

**Changes**:
- In the relevant function where the moduleâ€™s members are extracted, add logic to handle the empty `__all__` attribute.

**Example**:
- Update logic where `__all__` is checked to:
  
  
By making these changes, if `__all__` is found to be empty, `members` will also be an empty list, and thus no module members will be shown in the documentation. This effectively resolves the issue where an empty `__all__` is currently ignored.
