**Title**: Adjust Sphinx autodoc to respect empty `__all__` attribute

**Problem**: 
The Sphinx autodoc extension is ignoring an empty `__all__` attribute in modules, causing it to document all functions and objects within the module. This is incorrect behavior because, according to the Python documentation standard, if the `__all__` attribute is present and is an empty list, it should prevent any of the module's members from being automatically documented unless explicitly specified.

**Analysis**:
The issue is located within the `autodoc` functionality of Sphinx, which is responsible for fetching the members of a module to document. The current logic does not correctly handle cases where the `__all__` attribute is set but is an empty list. The `__all__` attribute should specifically control which members are publicly accessible and documented. An empty list should indicate that no members are to be documented.

To resolve this, adjustments need to be made to the code fetching and interpreting the `__all__` attribute within the module. Specifically, when `__all__` is an empty list, it should result in no members being automatically documented.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`

   Modify the logic where the members of a module are collected and filtered based on the `__all__` attribute. Ensure that if `__all__` is present and is an empty list, no members are included for documentation.

   - Locate the portions of the code where `__all__` is checked.
   - Add a condition to explicitly handle the case where `__all__` is an empty list by preventing any members from being added to the documentation list.
   - Ensure this condition is well-tested to avoid any unintended side effects.

**Detailed Description**:
1. Locate the function responsible for member filtering in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file. Typically, this will be the part of the code where `__all__` is checked, and members are either included or excluded based on its presence.

2. Introduce the following pseudocode logic:
   - If `__all__` exists:
     - If `__all__` is an empty list, then return an empty list (or equivalent) of members.
     - Otherwise, filter the members based on the contents of `__all__`.

3. Ensure that the handling of `__all__` is correctly integrated with the rest of the member-fetching logic.

4. Update related documentation if necessary to clarify the new behavior.

This approach will ensure that the empty `__all__` attribute is properly respected, thereby aligning the Sphinx autodoc behavior with Python's documentation standards.
