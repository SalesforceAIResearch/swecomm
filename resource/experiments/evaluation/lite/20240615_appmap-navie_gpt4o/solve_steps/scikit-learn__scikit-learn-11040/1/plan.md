**Title**: Add Integer Validation for `n_neighbors` in Neighbors Estimator

**Problem**: 
The `NearestNeighbors` estimator in scikit-learn raises a `TypeError` when a float is provided to the `n_neighbors` parameter, which expects an integer. This exception occurs deep in the code during the NeighborsHeap initialization, making it difficult to diagnose. The solution should catch this earlier and raise a more helpful error message or validate and convert the parameter accordingly.

**Analysis**:
The root of the problem is that the `n_neighbors` parameter is used directly without validation in multiple methods, leading to a `TypeError` when it gets interpreted as an integer in a compiled extension. To solve this, we should ensure the parameter type is validated early, ideally during initialization or at the beginning of methods that utilize this parameter (`fit`, `kneighbors` etc.).

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Add Validation in `__init__` Method**:
   Update the `__init__` methods of relevant classes (`NearestNeighbors`, `KNeighborsClassifier`, `KNeighborsRegressor`, `RadiusNeighborsClassifier`, `RadiusNeighborsRegressor`, and other relevant estimators) to include a type check for `n_neighbors`. If `n_neighbors` is not an integer, raise a `ValueError`.

2. **Ensure Validation in `kneighbors` Methods**:
   Any methods which use `n_neighbors` should also validate the type if it is provided as a parameter. Convert to integer if it can be inferred from a float directly.

3. **Refactor `_check_algorithm_metric` Method**:
   Enhance the validation in `_check_algorithm_metric` or create a new dedicated validation method to check this parameter efficiently.

**Example of Changes in File** (`sklearn/neighbors/base.py`):
- Update the `__init__` method of `NeighborsBase`.
- Add a new validation function `_validate_n_neighbors`.

`sklearn/neighbors/base.py`

1. **Update `__init__` Method**:
   - Modify the `__init__` method to validate `n_neighbors`.

2. **Add `_validate_n_neighbors` Method**:
   - Introduce a helper function `_validate_n_neighbors` that checks if `n_neighbors` is an integer and raises a `ValueError` if not. This method can be used in the constructors and relevant methods.

3. **Update Methods which Accept `n_neighbors`**:
   - Ensure methods accepting `n_neighbors` parameter also perform this validation, either by calling `_validate_n_neighbors`.

---

These changes require minimal updates to the existing logic and ensure that `n_neighbors` is validated at the right places to provide more informative error messages early in the execution flow. Here are follow-up details:

### Detailed Proposed Changes

**1. Update `__init__` method**:
- Ensure the constructor of relevant classes validates `n_neighbors`.

**2. Add `_validate_n_neighbors` method**:
- Define a method to validate the type of `n_neighbors`.

   

**3. Use `_validate_n_neighbors` in Methods**:
- Call this validation method in constructors and wherever `n_neighbors` is used.

   

   

In summary, the objective is to implement early and clear validation of `n_neighbors` to prevent ambiguous and late exceptions, thus improving the user experience and debugging process.
