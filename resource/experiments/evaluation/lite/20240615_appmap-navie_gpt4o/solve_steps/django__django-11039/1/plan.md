**Title**: Modify `sqlmigrate` to conditionally include BEGIN/COMMIT based on transactional DDL support

**Problem**: 
The `sqlmigrate` command in Django incorrectly wraps its output in `BEGIN/COMMIT` even if the database backend doesn't support transactional DDL. Currently, `sqlmigrate` only considers whether a migration is marked as atomic (`migration.atomic`) to determine if it should wrap the output. However, it should also check if the database backend supports rolling back DDL operations (`connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`).

**Analysis**:
The current logic in `sqlmigrate` needs to be updated to account for databases that do not support transactional DDL. This means that the assignment of `self.output_transaction` should be updated to also verify if `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` is `True`. The execution should skip wrapping DDL statements in `BEGIN/COMMIT` if the backend can't rollback DDL, thus avoiding potential errors and misbehavior.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/executor.py`

    - **Change**: Modify the `apply_migration` and `unapply_migration` methods to incorporate a check for `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` along with `migration.atomic`.

    - **Details**:
        - Locate the logic where `self.output_transaction` is assigned, which currently only checks `migration.atomic`. Here, the inclusion of the `BEGIN/COMMIT` statements should also take `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` into account.
        - Adjust the conditions to ensure both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` must be `True` for `self.output_transaction` to be assigned as `True`.

2. **File**: `django/db/backends/base/features.py`

    - **Change**: Ensure `can_rollback_ddl` is correctly set for all backend features.
    
    - **Details**:
        - Review and confirm that `can_rollback_ddl` is implemented properly across different backend features, if not already done.

3. **Additional Steps**:
   
    - Although changes to the tests are beyond our scope here, mention the importance of writing a test in `tests/migrations/test_commands.py` to simulate this scenario. Specifically, mock `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to `False` and ensure that `sqlmigrate` does not wrap the output in `BEGIN/COMMIT`.

By implementing the above changes, `sqlmigrate` will properly account for the database's capabilities and avoid wrapping DDL statements in `BEGIN/COMMIT` when the backend does not support rolling back DDL operations.
