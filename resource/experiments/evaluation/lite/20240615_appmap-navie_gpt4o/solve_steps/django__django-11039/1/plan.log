**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**

        Enable or disable autocommit.

        The usual way to start a transaction is to turn autocommit off.
        SQLite does not properly start a transaction when disabling
        autocommit. To avoid this buggy behavior and to actually enter a new
        transaction, an explcit BEGIN is required. Using
        force_begin_transaction_with_broken_autocommit=True will issue an

sqlmigrate wraps it's outpout in BEGIN/COMMIT even if the database doesn't support transactional DDL
Description
	 
		(last modified by Simon Charette)
	 
The migration executor only adds the outer BEGIN/COMMIT ​if the migration is atomic and ​the schema editor can rollback DDL but the current sqlmigrate logic only takes migration.atomic into consideration.
The issue can be addressed by
Changing sqlmigrate ​assignment of self.output_transaction to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl as well.
Adding a test in tests/migrations/test_commands.py based on ​an existing test for non-atomic migrations that mocks connection.features.can_rollback_ddl to False instead of overdidding MIGRATION_MODULES to point to a non-atomic migration.
I marked the ticket as easy picki... (921)
