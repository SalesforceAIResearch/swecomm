**Title**: Handle Exception in `__repr__` Method During Test Report Generation

**Problem**: 
When an exception occurs in the `__repr__` method while generating test reports, an `INTERNALERROR` is raised, causing the test suite to crash. This issue needs to be fixed to ensure proper error handling and error messages in test reports.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the issue is the failure to manage exceptions in the `__repr__` method when generating failure reports. The traceback indicates that the error occurs in the `saferepr` function within `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`, which tries to generate a safe representation of objects while creating the test report. If an exception occurs in `__repr__`, `_format_repr_exception` tries to format the exception, but this fails if no active exception is present.

To resolve this, an additional error-handling mechanism should be implemented within the `saferepr` function to catch exceptions raised by `__repr__` and process them appropriately. This involves wrapping the call to the `__repr__` method in a try-except block to safely handle any exceptions.

**Proposed Changes**: 
1. **File**: `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`
   - **Function**: `repr_instance`
     - **Changes**: Add a try-except block around the call to `repr(obj)` to handle potential exceptions raised by the `__repr__` method. In the except block, format the exception using `_format_repr_exception` to ensure a readable error message is produced.

Detailed description of changes:
- In `repr_instance`, instead of directly calling `repr(obj)`, enclose the call in a try-except block.
- Catch the exception and use `_format_repr_exception` to log and format the exception details.
- Ensure that the application continues its execution without crashing due to the exception in `__repr__`.

This change will ensure that if an exception occurs within the `__repr__` method, it is caught and a meaningful message is displayed in the test report, instead of causing an internal error and halting the test suite.

Review and implement the proposed changes to handle exceptions in the `__repr__` method correctly during test report generation. Ensure that the new error-handling logic enhances robustness without introducing additional issues.
