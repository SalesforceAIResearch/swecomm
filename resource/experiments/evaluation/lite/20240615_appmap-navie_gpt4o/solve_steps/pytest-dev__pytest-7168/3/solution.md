Let's implement the proposed changes to handle exceptions in the `__repr__` method correctly during test report generation.

**File**: `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`
**Function**: `repr_instance`
**Changes**: Add a try-except block around the call to `repr(obj)` to handle potential exceptions raised by the `repr` method. In the except block, format the exception using `_format_repr_exception` to ensure a readable error message is produced.

Here are the changes:

    return _ellipsize(s, self.maxsize)

def repr_instance(self, x: Any, level: int) -> str:
    try:
        s = repr(x)
    except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
        raise
    except BaseException as exc:
        s = _format_repr_exception(exc, x)
    return _ellipsize(s, self.maxsize)
]]></modified>
</change>

**Explanation**:
1. Wrapped the call to `repr(x)` inside a try-except block.
2. In case of a `BaseException`, format the exception using `_format_repr_exception`.

We maintain the original intent and behavior of the function while adding robustness by handling exceptions that can occur in the `__repr__` method of objects.

This solves the issue described in the problem statement by ensuring that exceptions in `__repr__` do not propagate and cause internal errors in the test reports. Instead, a meaningful error message is generated and included in the report.
