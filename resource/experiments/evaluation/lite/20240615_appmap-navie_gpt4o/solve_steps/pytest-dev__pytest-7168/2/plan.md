**Title**: Handle Exceptions in __repr__ During Exception Reporting.

**Problem**: 
When an exception occurs within the `__repr__` method of a class, it causes an `INTERNALERROR` in pytest during exception reporting. The provided sample code demonstrates that pytest fails with an `INTERNALERROR` when encountering an exception during the `__repr__` method of an object while collecting traceback information.

**Analysis**:
In the `_pytest/_code/code.py` file, during the process of creating a readable representation of an exception (`repr_excinfo`), pytest attempts to get the `__repr__` method of objects involved in the exception. If the `__repr__` method itself raises an exception, it leads to a runtime error within the pytest framework.

To solve this issue, the code that formats object representations for exceptions needs to be robust against exceptions raised by `__repr__`. This can be done by wrapping calls to `__repr__` in a try-except block, so that if `__repr__` fails, a safe fallback representation is used instead.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `_pytest/_code/code.py` file to add exception handling around the section where `__repr__` is called during exception reporting.

1. **Enhance `repr_args` Method**:
   - Locate the `repr_args` method, which is responsible for obtaining the string representation of function arguments.
   - Wrap the call to `saferepr(argvalue)` in a try-except block to catch any exceptions raised by `__repr__` and provide a safe fallback representation.

2. **Modify `repr_instance` Method in `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`**:
   - If encountered, ensure that any exceptions raised when trying to obtain the string representation of an object fall back to a safe representation.

### Changes in the `_pytest/_code/code.py` file:
1. **In function `repr_args`** (around line 693):
    - Add a try-except block around `saferepr(argvalue)` to safely handle any potential exceptions.

    

### Changes in the `_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` file:
2. **In the function `_format_repr_exception`** (around line 23):
    - Ensure it safely captures exceptions and provides a fallback representation.

    

3. **In the method `repr_instance`** (around line 60):
    - Ensure it safely captures exceptions and provides a fallback representation.

    

These changes should effectively handle exceptions raised by `__repr__` and prevent `INTERNALERROR` during pytest's exception reporting. This will provide a safer and more user-friendly error reporting mechanism within pytest.
