### Update Exception Handling in `saferepr` to Prevent INTERNALERROR

#### Problem
An `INTERNALERROR` occurs when an exception is raised in the `__repr__` method of an object. The traceback shows that the error arises while pytest tries to safely represent the object using the `saferepr` function. This leads to a traceback loop as the `__repr__` of the object re-raises an exception.

#### Root Cause
The root cause of this issue is the unhandled exception during the `repr` call in the `saferepr.py` module. This results in an INTERNALERROR instead of a graceful error report.

#### Analysis
To resolve this, the `saferepr` function should be modified to handle exceptions more gracefully. Specifically, we need to catch exceptions that occur within the `repr` call and provide a fallback representation to avoid crashing the test session.

#### Proposed Changes
The file to be modified is `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`.

1. **Add Exception Handling in `saferepr`**:
    - Modify the `SafeRepr` class to include exception handling within the `repr` method.
    - Catch any exceptions that occur during the `repr` call and handle them by providing a fallback representation.

Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Modify `saferepr.py`**:
    - Update the `SafeRepr` class to include a try-except block when calling `super().repr(x)`.

**Detailed Description:**

- Add a try-except block within the `SafeRepr.repr_instance` method to catch exceptions.
- Use a fallback representation method to handle objects that cause exceptions within their `__repr__` method.

The specific details to be changed:

- **Location**: In the `saferepr.py` file:
  - Find the class `SafeRepr`.
  - Locate the method `repr_instance`.

**File**: `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`

**Changes**:
- Modify `SafeRepr` class:
  - Add exception handling in the `repr_instance` method.

### Example Modification:
(Do not include as code but describe the modification)
- In the `SafeRepr` class' `repr_instance` method, add a try-except block:
  - Try to call `super().repr(x)`.
  - In the except block, catch the exception and provide a fallback string representation such as `"<unrepresentable object>"`.

By implementing these changes, exceptions that occur during the representation of objects will be caught, preventing the INTERNALERROR and ensuring a more robust error reporting system.

Again, ensure to implement these changes in the `saferepr.py` file. This will localize the fix and resolve the issue without widespread modifications to unrelated sections of the codebase.
