To address the issue of INTERNALERRORs occurring when an exception is raised in the `__repr__` method of an object, we need to update the `SafeRepr` class in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` to handle exceptions more gracefully. Specifically, we'll add a try-except block in the `repr_instance` method to catch any such exceptions and provide a fallback representation.

Here's the proposed change to the `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` file:

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py</file>
<original line-count="14" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class SafeRepr(reprlib.Repr):
    """subclass of repr.Repr that limits the resulting size of repr()
    and includes information on exceptions raised during the call.
    """

    def __init__(self, maxsize: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.maxstring = maxsize
        self.maxsize = maxsize

    def repr(self, x: Any) -> str:
        try:
            s = super().repr(x)
        except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
            raise
        except BaseException as exc:
            s = _format_repr_exception(exc, x)
        return _ellipsize(s, self.maxsize)

    def repr_instance(self, x: Any, level: int) -> str:

<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class SafeRepr(reprlib.Repr):
    """subclass of repr.Repr that limits the resulting size of repr()
    and includes information on exceptions raised during the call.
    """

    def __init__(self, maxsize: int) -> None:
        super().__init__()
        self.maxstring = maxsize
        self.maxsize = maxsize

    def repr(self, x: Any) -> str:
        try:
            s = super().repr(x)
        except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
            raise
        except BaseException as exc:
            s = _format_repr_exception(exc, x)
        return _ellipsize(s, self.maxsize)

    def repr_instance(self, x: Any, level: int) -> str:
        try:
            s = super().repr_instance(x, level)
        except (KeyboardInterrupt, SystemExit):
            raise
        except BaseException as exc:
            s = _format_repr_exception(exc, x)
        return _ellipsize(s, self.maxsize)
]]></modified>
</change>
```

With this update, the `repr_instance` method will catch any exceptions that occur when calling `super().repr_instance(x, level)`, prevent the `INTERNALERROR`, and provide a more user-friendly fallback representation for the object.

### Testing the Change

To ensure that our modifications work as expected, we will write a test case that triggers an exception in the `__repr__` method of an object and check that the `saferepr` function handles it gracefully.

Here's a test case that you can add to your test suite:

```python
def test_saferepr_handles_exception_in_repr():
    class FaultyRepr:
        def __repr__(self):
            raise ValueError("faulty repr")

    obj = FaultyRepr()
    safe_rep = saferepr(obj)
    assert "ValueError('faulty repr')" in safe_rep
    assert "<[ValueError(" in safe_rep
```

This test case creates a class with a `__repr__` method that raises a `ValueError`. When we pass an instance of this class to the `saferepr` function, we expect it to catch the exception and return a string that includes the exception information in a formatted way.
