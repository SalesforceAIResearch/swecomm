**Title**: Modify inverse trigonometric function table and handling in `VectorLatexPrinter` to support `acsc` and `asec`

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `VectorLatexPrinter` in SymPy's printing module doesn't fully support the "full" style for inverse trigonometric functions `acsc` and `asec`. Specifically, the `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style="full")` function call should return `'\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'`, but it currently returns `'\\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'`. An update in the handling logic for these functions is needed.

**Analysis**:
The root of the problem lies in the `VectorLatexPrinter` class found in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`, which only includes a subset of inverse trigonometric functions (`asin`, `acos`, `atan`, `acot`) in its logic for handling full inverse trig function names. Consequently, when functions like `acsc` and `asec` are processed, they fail to transform correctly under the "full" style configuration. 

The solution is to extend the list of supported inverse trig functions to include `acsc` and `asec`, and ensure the corresponding handling logic is updated to perform the desired name transformation properly.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`

    - Extend the `inv_trig_table` list to include `acsc` and `asec`:

        Modify the line where `inv_trig_table` is defined to:
        `inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acsc", "asec", "acot"]`

    - Ensure that the definition and handling for `acsc` and `asec` correctly follow the "full" style:
  
        Find and modify sections where `inv_trig_style == "full"` to include the transformation for `acsc` and `asec`. Ensure that these new functions follow the same pattern as the existing ones for transforming names:

        Modify the logic in the `_print_Function` method within the `VectorLatexPrinter` class to check for `acsc` and `asec` and apply the appropriate transformation (e.g., `arcfunc[1:]`).

2. **Ensure the logic for transforming these names is consistent** such that:
   
    - `"acsc"` translates to `"arccsc"`
    - `"asec"` translates to `"arcsec"`

    Note: Any downstream effects or additional references to inverse trigonometric functions beyond the scope of `VectorLatexPrinter` should be considered, but modifications should be localized to this file as per the requirement.

By applying these changes, the `latex` function should correctly output the full form of `acsc` and `asec` names, satisfying the requirement.
