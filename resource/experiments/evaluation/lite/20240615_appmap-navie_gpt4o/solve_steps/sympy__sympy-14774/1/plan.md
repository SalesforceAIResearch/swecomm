**Title**: Update inverse trig function names for Latex printer to support full names for acsc and asec

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `latex()` function in the SymPy project does not support full inverse trigonometric function names for `acsc` (arccosecant) and `asec` (arcsecant). While functions like `asin` have their full names expanded correctly, `acsc` and `asec` are output as `\\operatorname{acsc}` and `\\operatorname{asec}` instead of the preferred `\\operatorname{arccsc}` and `\\operatorname{arcsec}`, respectively.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue lies in the incomplete list of inverse trigonometric functions within the `inv_trig_table` variable in the latex printer code. Currently, this table includes `asin`, `acos`, `atan`, and `acot`, but it omits `acsc` and `asec`.

To fix this, we simply need to extend the `inv_trig_table` with the missing inverse trig function names. 

**Proposed Changes**:
Update the `inv_trig_table` in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to include `acsc` and `asec` along with the existing inverse trig function names.

1. **sympy/printing/latex.py**:
    - Locate the definition of `inv_trig_table`.
    - Extend the list to include `"acsc"` and `"asec"`, so it becomes `["asin", "acos", "atan", "acsc", "asec", "acot"]`.

This change will ensure that when `inv_trig_style="full"` is specified, the functions `acsc` and `asec` will be printed correctly as `\\operatorname{arccsc}` and `\\operatorname{arcsec}`.

**Expected Outcome**:
After the proposed change, calling `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style="full")` and `latex(asec(x), inv_trig_style="full")` should output the full names `\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}` and `\\operatorname{arcsec}{\\left (x \\right )}`, matching the behavior for other inverse trig functions like `asin`.
