To address the issue of the LaTeX printer not supporting full inverse trigonometric function names for `acsc` and `asec`, we need to update the `inv_trig_table` in the `VectorLatexPrinter` class within the `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` file. This will involve adding the `acsc` and `asec` functions to this table and ensuring that the LaTeX printer handles these functions correctly when `inv_trig_style` is set to "full".

Here's the modified code:

```xml
<change>
  <file change-number-for-this-file="1">sympy/physics/vector/printing.py</file>
  <original line-count="24" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
            inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acot"]
]]></original>
  <modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
            inv_trig_table = ["asin", "acos", "atan", "acot", "asec", "acsc"]
]]></modified>
</change>
```

With this change, the `inv_trig_table` now includes `asec` and `acsc`, enabling the LaTeX printer to handle these functions correctly when the `inv_trig_style` is set to "full".

If there are any additional changes necessary for logic relying on this table, they should also be considered. However, the primary adjustment required for including these functions within the LaTeX printer is updated with the above change. 

Please review the change and test to ensure full inverse trigonometric function names are converted correctly in LaTeX.
