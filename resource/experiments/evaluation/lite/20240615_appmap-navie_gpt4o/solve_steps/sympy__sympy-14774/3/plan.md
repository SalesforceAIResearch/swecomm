### Update the Inverse Trigonometric Functions Table for Full Name Conversion

**Problem**

The LaTeX printer does not support full inverse trigonometric function names for `acsc` and `asec`. For example, `latex(asin(x), inv_trig_style="full")` correctly returns `'\arcsin{\\left (x \\right )}'`. However, `latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style="full")` incorrectly gives `'\operatorname{acsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'` instead of `'\operatorname{arccsc}{\\left (x \\right )}'`.

**Analysis**

The issue arises because the list of inverse trigonometric functions (`inv_trig_table`) does not include `acsc` and `asec`. Consequently, the LaTeX printer does not know how to handle these functions when the `inv_trig_style` is set to "full".

To resolve this, the list needs to be updated to include these missing functions. This involves modifying the corresponding list so that the LaTeX printer can appropriately handle the "full" naming convention for all inverse trigonometric functions.

Additionally, ensure that any logic relying on this list is compatible with the added functions.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **Update `inv_trig_table` in `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`**

   **File:** sympy/physics/vector/printing.py

   Modify the `inv_trig_table` to include `acsc` and `asec`.

   **Detailed Changes:**

   - Locate the `inv_trig_table` within the given code snippet and update it as follows:

     

2. **Verify the Full Name Conversion Logic**

   Ensure that the logic converting the function names to the "full" style is compatible with the new entries. This typically means confirming that the function names are updated correctly following the set rules.

3. **Check for Any Additional Adjustments**

   Review the code to make sure no other changes are required as a result of this update. For example, make sure that the functions are covered under any further logic that handles inverse trigonometric functions.

**Contextual Code Changes**

1. **sympy/physics/vector/printing.py**: 

   Modify the `inv_trig_table` initialization as described above from around line 89-110.
   
   

2. **sympy/physics/vector/printing.py**: 

   Ensure proper conditional branches are correctly handling new additions around `inv_trig_style` logic from line 89-110, focusing on parts that were initially controlling the rename logic.

In this way, the printer will be able to handle and convert the styles for `acsc` and `asec` as intended when the `inv_trig_style` is set to "full".
