To address the failing test case `test_ambiguous_relationship_model` in the `RelativeFieldTests` test suite, we need to resolve the ambiguity in field relationships, specifically when using `ManyToManyField`. Based on the error output and provided context, the test is complaining about an ambiguous relationship model which might be due to incorrect usage or checking of `ManyToManyField` and its related fields.

The failure indicates that the error checking is expecting a `ForeignKey` relation where a `ManyToManyField` might be passed. This mismatch needs correction in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file.

## Required Changes:

1. Update the error handling to ensure that the type of field being checked matches with the type expected in the test (e.g., if it expects `ForeignKey` instead of `ManyToManyField`).

Explanation: 
- The original code validates fields that are supposed to be foreign keys, but it can be generalized to relationship keys which could be `ForeignKey` or `ManyToManyField`.
- This modifies the error message in a generic form to handle various relationship fields, not just `ForeignKey`.

Please apply this change and re-run the tests to check if the error is resolved. If there are any other specific test failures with more details, we can further refine our approach.
