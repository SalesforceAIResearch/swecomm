**Title**: Correct hint message for recursive relationship in intermediary m2m model

**Problem**: 
When an intermediary model in a many-to-many (m2m) field has more than two `ForeignKeys`, and no `through_fields` are set, Django provides an incorrect hint suggesting the use of `ForeignKey` keyword arguments which are actually meant for `ManyToManyField`. Additionally, `symmetrical=False`, which was a required argument in older versions (prior to Django 3.0), is no longer necessary for defining recursive relationships with intermediary models.

**Analysis**:
The hint message is misleading. The correct arguments (`symmetrical` and `through`) are not relevant to `ForeignKey`. The purpose of the hint is to guide the user to correctly define recursive relationships using a Many-to-Many field with an intermediary model. However, the current hint incorrectly mentions `ForeignKey` instead of `ManyToManyField`.

The error message is likely generated during validation checks when the fields of a Model are being inspected. The function or method responsible for this validation should output the correct hint message.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Django Codebase**:
    - Identify where the exception error with the hint message is raised. This could be within the model field validation logic or the Many-to-Many field processing logic.
    - Update the incorrect hint message to correctly refer to `ManyToManyField` and remove the outdated requirement of `symmetrical=False`.

2. **Files to Change**:
    - **File**: `django/db/models/fields/related.py` (location is hypothetical and may vary; ensure to pinpoint the actual location where the exception message is generated)
        - **Changes**:
            - Locate the function or method generating the error hint for recursive relationships in intermediary models.
            - Modify the hint message from:

              

              To:

              
              - Remove any references to `symmetrical=False`.

**Summary**: By updating the incorrect hint message to correctly reference `ManyToManyField` instead of `ForeignKey` and removing outdated arguments, we align the hint with Django's current requirements and usage, thereby preventing user confusion and guiding them correctly on how to set up recursive relationships with intermediary models.
