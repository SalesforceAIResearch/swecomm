**Title**: Correct the hint about recursive relationship to reference ManyToManyField instead of ForeignKey and remove outdated requirement.

**Problem**:
When there's more than two ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a many-to-many (m2m) field and no through_fields have been set, Django shows an error with an incorrect hint. The hint suggests using ForeignKey with 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters, but these are actually m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey arguments. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' requirement for recursive relationships with intermediary models is outdated and has not been required since Django 3.0.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises from an incorrect error message in the Django codebase. Specifically, the hint incorrectly references the `ForeignKey` and suggests using 'symmetrical' and 'through' parameters, which are specific to the `ManyToManyField`. Additionally, the 'symmetrical=False' parameter for m2m recursive relationships with intermediary models has been obsolete since Django 3.0.

To resolve this issue, we need to:
1. Modify the hint to correctly reference the `ManyToManyField` instead of `ForeignKey`.
2. Remove the 'symmetrical=False' recommendation from the hint as it is no longer required.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/related.py`
   - Locate the code that raises the error and displays the hint.
   - Change the reference from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.
   - Remove the 'symmetrical=False' part of the hint text.

Detailed proposed change:
- Locate the section in the `django/db/models/fields/related.py` file that raises the error message related to recursive relationships.
- Update the hint to read:
  "If you want to create a recursive relationship, use ManyToManyField('%s', through='%s')."

By making this change, the hint will correctly guide the developer to use the appropriate m2m field configuration, and the removal of the obsolete 'symmetrical=False' recommendation will prevent confusion regarding outdated requirements.
