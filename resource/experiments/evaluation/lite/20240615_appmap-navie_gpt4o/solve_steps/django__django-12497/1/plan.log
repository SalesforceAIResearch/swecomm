**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Wrong hint about recursive relationship.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Matheus Cunha Motta)
	 
When there's more than 2 ForeignKeys in an intermediary model of a m2m field and no through_fields have been set, Django will show an error with the following hint:
hint=(
	'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '
	'use ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s").'
But 'symmetrical' and 'through' are m2m keyword arguments, not ForeignKey.
This was probably a small mistake where the developer thought ManyToManyField but typed ForeignKey instead. And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.
Edit: fixed desc... (829)
