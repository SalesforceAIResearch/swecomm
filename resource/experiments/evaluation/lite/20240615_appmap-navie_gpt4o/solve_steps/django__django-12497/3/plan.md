### Correct the Hint for Recursive Relationship Error
**Problem**

When there are more than two `ForeignKeys` in an intermediary model of a `ManyToManyField` and no `through_fields` have been set, Django shows an incorrect error hint indicating the use of `ForeignKey`. The hint suggests using `symmetrical=False` and `through` as keyword arguments for `ForeignKey`, which is incorrect since these are actually `ManyToManyField` keyword arguments. Moreover, as of Django 3.0, `symmetrical=False` is no longer required for recursive relationships with intermediary models to self.

**Analysis**

The incorrect hint appears to guide users towards resolving recursive relationship issues, but it mistakenly suggests using `symmetrical` and `through` with a `ForeignKey` instead of a `ManyToManyField`. This outdated recommendation needs to be revised to avoid confusion among developers and align with current Django practices.

To resolve this, we need to find the logic responsible for generating the hint message and correct it to suggest using `ManyToManyField` instead of `ForeignKey` and remove the reference to `symmetrical=False`.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **File: django/db/migrations/state.py**

    Locate the code that generates the hint for recursive relationships. Considering the context, this is where the incorrect hint is likely generated.

    **Modifications:**
   
    - Update the hint message to correctly refer to `ManyToManyField`.
    - Remove the outdated `symmetrical=False` recommendation.

    **Detailed Instructions:**

    - Look for the section of the code that defines the error hint message, typically involving relationship validation.
    - Replace the incorrect `ForeignKey("%s", symmetrical=False, through="%s")` with the correct `ManyToManyField(to="%s", through="%s")`.
    - Ensure that any references to the outdated `symmetrical=False` requirement are removed.

Following these steps will make sure that the hint provided is accurate and in line with Django's best practices.
