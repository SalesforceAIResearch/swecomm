**Title**: Raise an error when defining a related_name on symmetrical ManyToManyFields

**Problem**: In ManyToManyField, when the symmetrical argument is used (i.e., in self-referential ManyToMany relationships), the related field on the target model is not created. However, developers might inadvertently specify a `related_name` despite the relationship being symmetrical, leading to confusion since the `related_name` parameter will be ignored in such a scenario.

**Analysis**: The intended behavior for ManyToManyField when `symmetrical=True` is that it does not create a reverse relation on the target model (because the relationship's reverse is itself). If a `related_name` is provided by the developer in this configuration, it will be ignored, which could lead to debugging challenges or misunderstandings of the field's behavior.

To prevent such confusion, an error should be raised when a `related_name` is set on a ManyToManyField which is symmetrical. This ensures that developers are made aware of the incompatibility upfront.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`
   - **Change Description**: Modify the initialization logic in the `ManyToManyRel` class to raise a `ValueError` when a `related_name` is provided on a symmetrical relationship.
   - **Specific Modifications**:
     - Inside the `__init__` method of the `ManyToManyRel` class, add a check that raises a `ValueError` if `symmetrical=True` and `related_name` is provided.
   
2. **Code Changes**:
   - **Location**: `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py:280-304`
     - **Add Logic**: Inside the `ManyToManyRel.__init__` method before setting instance attributes, add a condition to check if `self.symmetrical` is `True` and `self.related_name` is set. Raise a `ValueError` if both conditions are true.

     _Detailed Description of Changes_:
     - Ensure that before or after setting the `self.symmetrical` attribute, the check for `related_name` should be done to immediately inform the developer of the issue.
     - Example (non-code snippet):
       
       Place this check at the beginning of the `__init__` method of the `ManyToManyRel` class.

**Summary**: By implementing the check inside the `ManyToManyRel` class constructor, we prevent any attempts to confuse the symmetrical ManyToManyField relationships with a related_name. This change should add clarity and help maintain consistency within the `ManyToManyField` behavior, providing immediate feedback to developers.
