**Title**: Update `_tick_only` function to accommodate callable `axis` attributes in non-default `AxesGrid` axes classes

**Problem**: When creating an `AxesGrid` using a non-default axis class such as `cartopy.GeoAxes`, a `TypeError` is raised. The error occurs because the `_tick_only` method in `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_grid` tries to access keys from the `axis` attribute, which behaves differently in `GeoAxes`.

**Analysis**:
The `GeoAxes` class has a callable `axis` attribute, whereas the default `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.mpl_axes.Axes` class treats `axis` as a dictionary allowing indexing operations. The `_tick_only` method currently assumes the latter and attempts to index `axis` with `"bottom"` and `"left"`, causing a `TypeError` when applied to `GeoAxes`.

To fix this issue, the `_tick_only` method needs to be updated to handle cases where the `axis` attribute is a callable, without directly indexing it. A possible approach is to check if the `axis` attribute is callable and adapt the logic accordingly. 

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py`
   - **Function**: `_tick_only`
   - **Changes**:
     - Add a check to determine if the `axis` attribute is callable.
     - If `axis` is callable, invoke it to retrieve the appropriate axis object before toggling the tick labels and label visibility.
     - Refactor the logic to ensure compatibility with both default `Axes` and non-default `axes_class` implementations like `GeoAxes`.

**Detailed Change Description**:
1. Locate the `_tick_only` function.
2. Modify the code to check the type of `ax.axis`. If it is callable, handle it separately to retrieve the axis objects:
   - For callable `axis`, use the callable to get the proper axis handle.
   - For dictionary-like `axis`, proceed as originally implemented.
3. Ensure that toggling tick labels and label visibility is compatible across different `axis` types.

By implementing these changes, the `AxesGrid` will be able to work with a wider range of `axes_class` types, including those with callable `axis` attributes. This will resolve the `TypeError` and enhance the flexibility of creating grids with custom axes.
