**Title**: Fix TypeError in AxesGrid when using custom `axes_class`

**Problem**: Creating an `AxesGrid` with a custom `axes_class` such as `GeoAxes` results in a `TypeError: 'method' object is not subscriptable`. This error occurs because the `axis` attribute of `GeoAxes` and other custom axes classes is a callable, unlike `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.mpl_axes.Axes`, where `axis` is a dictionary-like object.

**Analysis**: 

The issue arises within the `_tick_only` helper function in `mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py`. This function attempts to access keys from the `axis` attribute of an `Axes` instance:



For `GeoAxes` and potentially other custom classes, `ax.axis` is a method, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix the issue, we need to handle the scenario where `ax.axis` is a method. One potential approach is to check if `ax.axis` is callable and, if so, return early to avoid attempting subscript operations.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py`**

   **Function: `_tick_only`**
   - Add a check to determine if `ax.axis` is callable. If it is, log a message and return early, thereby skipping the toggle operations since they assume `axis` is a dictionary-like structure.

   **Detailed Changes**:
   - At the beginning of the `_tick_only` function, add a check:
     - `if callable(ax.axis):`
       - Use a logger to note that the axis attribute is callable, and custom axle handling is needed.
       - Return early from the `_tick_only` function if the axis attribute is callable.
     
2. **File: `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py`**
   **Function: `set_label_mode`**
   - Ensure that the `set_label_mode` method correctly handles cases where custom `axes_class` instances are used by incorporating the additional handling from `_tick_only`.

**Example Code** (not exact code, just illustrative):



By implementing these changes, we account for the scenario where `ax.axis` is callable, thus avoiding the TypeError when custom `axes_class` instances are used within `AxesGrid`.
