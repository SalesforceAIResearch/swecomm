**Title**: Correct AxesGrid Configuration for Non-Default Axis Classes

**Problem**: 
When creating an `AxesGrid` using a non-default axis class such as Cartopy's `GeoAxes`, a `TypeError` is raised. The error occurs because the `axis` attribute in `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.mpl_axes.Axes` is being accessed in a way that is incompatible with how `axis` is implemented in other classes like `GeoAxes`. Specifically, `axis` is only a callable in some axis classes, leading to the error `'method' object is not subscriptable`.

**Analysis**: 
The `TypeError` is caused by the attempt to subscript `axis` in the method `_tick_only` within the `axes_grid1` module. The `_tick_only` function is trying to access elements of `axis` using dictionary-style access (`axis["bottom"]`, `axis["left"]`), which is not supported by axis classes that only implement `axis` as a method.

The goal is to make the `_tick_only` function resilient to different implementations of `axis` so that it can handle axis classes that do not support subscriptable `axis`.

**Proposed Changes**: 

1. **File**: `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py`
   
   **Location**: Function `_tick_only`, Line 17
   
   **Change**:
   - Modify the `_tick_only` function to check if the `axis` attribute is a dictionary or a method. If it's a method, use `getattr` to access axis properties appropriately.

   **Detailed Description**:
   - Introduce a condition in the `_tick_only` function to verify the type of `axis`.
   - If the axis is a method, refactor the function to use the appropriate method calls to achieve the same result as the dictionary-like access.

   

2. **File**: `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py`
   
   **Location**: Method `set_label_mode` in the `Grid` class, Line 389
   
   **Change**:
   - Ensure that calls to `_tick_only` in the `set_label_mode` method are using the modified `_tick_only` that checks the type of `axis`.

   **Detailed Description**:
   - The root cause call sites need to be adapted to use the updated `_tick_only`.

   

Applying these changes will allow the `AxesGrid` to handle different implementations of `axis`, including those in classes like `GeoAxes`, and avoid the `TypeError`.

Note: No changes to test case files, test cases, or documentation beyond this single-file modification are required for this fix.
