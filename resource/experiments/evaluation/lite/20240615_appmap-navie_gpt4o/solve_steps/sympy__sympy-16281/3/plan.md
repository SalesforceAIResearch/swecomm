**Title**: Improve the Pretty Printing for the `Product` Class

**Problem**: The pretty printing for the `Product` class in SymPy is visually suboptimal. The representation appears too large due to unnecessary empty lines at the bottom and an overly broad product symbol (∏). Moreover, the top bar being too short also affects the visual aesthetics.

**Analysis**: The `pprint` function and its use of `Product` pretty printing need refining for better visual clarity and conciseness. The primary issues are the empty line at the bottom of the product symbol, the overly broad product symbol, and the top bar's visual representation.

To improve the prettification, we need to:

1. Remove the unnecessary empty line at the bottom of the product symbol.
2. Resize the product symbol for better fit and alignment.
3. Extend the top bar of the product symbol to harmonize with the rest of the elements.

This will involve making changes to the logic responsible for rendering the pretty-printed product symbols. Specifically, the formatting and structure adjustments should be applied to ensure improved aesthetic appeal without losing mathematical correctness.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py**
    
    - Modify the function responsible for drawing the product symbol (∏). This function should be updated to remove the bottom empty line and resize the symbol accordingly.
    - Adjust the method that renders the top bar of the product symbol to ensure it is extended properly.

2. **File: sympy/concrete/products.py**
    
    - Review and if necessary adjust any existing formatting logic within the `Product` class that pertains to pretty-printing to align with the changes made in `pretty_symbology.py`.

3. **File: sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py**
    
    - Alter the pretty-printing logic to adopt the new product symbol format. Ensure the changes reflect the skinnier and extended top-bar design.
    - Update any spacing or alignment logic to prevent unnecessary empty lines at the bottom of the product symbol.

Make the following adjustments:

- Refactor product symbol drawing to use a skinnier symbol.
- Remove the bottom empty space.
- Ensure the top bar is extended appropriately to align elements.

These changes should collectively result in a more visually appealing and compact pretty-printed product representation. When executed, the `pprint` function should display the `Product` instances with improved aesthetics as demonstrated in the comparison examples provided.
