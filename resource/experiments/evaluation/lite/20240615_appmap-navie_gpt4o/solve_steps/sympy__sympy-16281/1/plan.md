**Title**: Improve Product Pretty Printing in Sympy

**Problem**: The current pretty printing for the `Product` class in Sympy is suboptimal. It has a few aesthetic issues that can be improved:
1. An unnecessary empty line at the bottom of the `∏` symbol.
2. The `∏` symbol is too wide.
3. Extending the top bar of the `∏` might improve readability.

**Analysis**: Pretty printing in Sympy for mathematical expressions like `Product` involves converting the expression tree into a graphical representation using ASCII or Unicode characters. The current implementation places an extra empty line at the bottom of the `∏`, making it larger than necessary and visually unbalanced. Additionally, the current width and style of the `∏` symbol can be optimized for better aesthetics.

Here are the steps to address these issues:
1. Remove the extra empty line at the bottom of the `∏` symbol.
2. Reduce the width of the `∏` symbol for better visual compactness.
3. Optionally, experiment with extending the top bar of the `∏` to see if it improves readability.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py`**
   - Modify the `vobj` dictionary that defines vertical symbols to remove the extra line from the `∏` symbol.
   - Adjust the width of the `∏` symbol.
   - Optionally, modify the top bar extension for the `∏` symbol.

2. **Logic Changes**:
   - Locate the `vobj` dictionary in `pretty_symbology.py`. This dictionary might look like this:
     
   - Change the representation of the `∏` symbol. Example modification:
     
   - If experimenting with the top bar, adjust the symbol as follows:
     
   - Modify the `prettyForm` generation for the `Product` class accordingly, ensuring that the visual output is as desired.

By making these modifications, the pretty printing for the `Product` class will be more visually appealing and balanced without the unnecessary empty line and with a more compact symbol representation.

These changes do not require modifications to test files as functionality validation and rendering can be tested in the standard REPL or runtime environment provided by the Sympy package.
