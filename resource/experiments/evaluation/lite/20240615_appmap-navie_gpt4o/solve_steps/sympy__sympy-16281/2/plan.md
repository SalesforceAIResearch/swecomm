**Title**: Improve Pretty Printing of `Product` in SymPy

**Problem**:
The current pretty-printing of the `Product` class in SymPy could be visually improved. Specifically:
1. There is always an extra empty line at the bottom of the rendered product, making it look asymmetrical.
2. The product symbol ('∏') is too wide, especially compared to the equivalent sum representation.
3. The top bar might be extended for better visual alignment, but it's uncertain if this would improve the appearance.

**Analysis**:
The pretty-printing functionality for the `Product` class in SymPy can be found in the `pretty.py` module. Specifically, modifications need to be made to the method responsible for rendering the product notation. This method should ensure:
- Removing or minimizing the additional empty line at the bottom of the product rendering.
- Adjusting the width of the '∏' symbol to make it more compact, while still ensuring it doesn't lose its distinctiveness.
- Optionally, experimenting with extending the top bar for visual alignment.

The changes primarily involve modifying the string representations and the positioning logic within the method handling the pretty printing.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py**
   - Function: `PrettyPrinter._print_Product`
     - Modify the method to improve the appearance of the product symbol and align it more closely with other mathematical notations like the sum.
     - Remove or minimize the additional bottom empty line in the product rendering.
     - Adjust the width of the '∏' symbol.
     - Optionally extend the top bar for better visual alignment and check if it enhances the appearance.

   Detailed Modifications:
   - Review the existing logic that handles the height and width of the product symbol.
   - Tweak the conditions and the string concatenations to ensure the symbol's dimensions are visually appealing.
   - Modify how fractions are aligned under the product, ensuring they are tight and aligned properly.

The changes should be carefully tested visually using both Unicode and ASCII representations to ensure cross-platform consistency.

After making these changes, review and test the output in various environments to ensure that the pretty printout is both visually pleasing and consistent across different uses of the `Product` class in SymPy. This improvement will benefit users by providing a clearer and more aesthetically pleasing mathematical notation.
