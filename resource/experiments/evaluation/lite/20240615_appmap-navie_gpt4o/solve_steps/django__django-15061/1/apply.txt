Sure, let's address the issue by removing the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class in `django/forms/widgets.py`. Below are the changes needed to accomplish this.

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">django/forms/widgets.py</file>
<original line-count="20" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
    def id_for_label(self, id_):
        if id_:
            id_ += '_0'
        return id_
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[    # Method id_for_label removed in MultiWidget class

]]></modified>
</change>
```

This change involves removing the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class, so it aligns with the flexibility provided by other widget classes such as `ChoiceWidget`.

Let me know if you need any further changes or additional modifications.
