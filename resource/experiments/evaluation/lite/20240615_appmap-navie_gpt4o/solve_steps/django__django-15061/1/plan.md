**Title**: Remove `id_for_label` Method from `MultiWidget` Class in Django

**Problem**: 
The `MultiWidget` class in Django generates an `id_for_label` in the format `f'{id_}0'`, which can be unnecessary and inflexible. For instance, the `ChoiceWidget` class allows customizing the behavior of the label ID through the method `self.add_id_index`. Therefore, it would be more efficient to remove the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class to allow better control over label IDs.

**Analysis**:
The `id_for_label` method appends an index (like `0`) to the ID, which might not be desired in many use cases. Eliminating this method will allow the label ID to be determined by the default or other customizable means provided by Django's widget framework. This change will align `MultiWidget` with other widgets such as `ChoiceWidget` which provides greater flexibility in handling label IDs.

The root of the issue lies in the `MultiWidget` class where the `id_for_label` method is defined. By removing this method, the default behavior for generating label IDs will take over, which can be further customized if required.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/forms/widgets.py`
   - **Class `MultiWidget`**: Remove the method `id_for_label`.

Steps:
1. Locate the `MultiWidget` class in `django/forms/widgets.py`.
2. Identify and remove the `id_for_label` method from this class.
3. Ensure that `MultiWidget` inherits the default behavior from its parent class or the framework.

This change simplifies the code and enhances flexibility for users who need customized label IDs.

**Example**:
- Before: The method `id_for_label` that generates IDs in the format `f'{id_}0'`.
- After: No `id_for_label` method in `MultiWidget`, allowing for a more flexible generation of label IDs.

By making this change, the `MultiWidget` class will behave consistently with how other widgets, like `ChoiceWidget`, allow more control over the label ID generation process.
