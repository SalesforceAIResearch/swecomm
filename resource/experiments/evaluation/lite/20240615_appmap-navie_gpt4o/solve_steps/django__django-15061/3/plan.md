**Title**: Remove `id_for_label` method from `MultiWidget` class.

**Problem**: The `Raw MultiWidget` class generates `id_for_label` in the format `f'{id_}0'`. This pattern might not make sense in various situations, and users have no straightforward way to customize it. For example, the `ChoiceWidget` class has an `add_id_index` property, providing flexibility for deciding label_id with or without the index. Thus, having a hardcoded `id_for_label` pattern in `MultiWidget` can lead to inconsistencies and a lack of flexibility.

**Analysis**: The method `id_for_label` in the `MultiWidget` class currently generates an `id` for the label using an inflexible pattern. Given the description, it seems more beneficial to remove this method entirely, allowing for greater customization like in the `ChoiceWidget` class. This change will lead to a more flexible and cohesive system for generating IDs for labels in `MultiWidget` instances. When `id_for_label` is removed, widgets that subclass `MultiWidget` should use a more flexible or context-appropriate mechanism to generate their label IDs.

**Proposed Changes**: The focus should be on the `MultiWidget` class and its `id_for_label` method.

1. **`django/forms/widgets.py`**:
    - **Remove** the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class.
    - **Update** any references to `id_for_label` within the `MultiWidget` class to use a more flexible or context-appropriate mechanism for generating label IDs if needed (e.g., checking for an `add_id_index` property).

**Changes in** `django/forms/widgets.py`:

1. **Remove** `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class.
2. **Audit and update** connected methods/attributes referencing `id_for_label` (e.g., add an `add_id_index` attribute or similar to handle ID generation).

By implementing these changes, we ensure that the `MultiWidget` class does not enforce an inflexible `id` pattern, allowing for better cohesion and flexibility similar to the `ChoiceWidget` class.
