### Remove `id_for_label` Method from `MultiWidget` Class

**Problem**: The current implementation of the `id_for_label` method in the `MultiWidget` class generates an ID for the label using a format like `f'{id_}0'`, which is not always desirable. Other widgets such as `ChoiceWidget` allow more flexibility by using methods like `self.add_id_index` to decide how the label ID should be displayed. It would be better to remove the `id_for_label` method completely from the `MultiWidget` class to allow for more customization and consistency.

**Analysis**: The `id_for_label` method in the `MultiWidget` class currently formats the label's ID in a way that appends a specific index to the base ID, which might not be suitable for all use cases. In contrast, the `ChoiceWidget` uses a more flexible method (`add_id_index`) that allows the developer to control the ID format. Removing the `id_for_label` method from `MultiWidget` can provide a cleaner and more flexible approach.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Locate the `MultiWidget` class within the codebase.
2. Identify the `id_for_label` method within this class.
3. Remove the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class.
4. Ensure that the removal does not affect other parts of the code where `MultiWidget` is used.

**Detailed Description**:
- **File**: `django/forms/widgets.py` (Assuming `MultiWidget` class is defined here)
  - **Remove `id_for_label` Method**:
    - Identify and remove the `id_for_label` method from the `MultiWidget` class.
    - Ensure that the removal does not disrupt any other method or property within the `MultiWidget` class.

By removing this method, users of the `MultiWidget` class will need to implement their own logic, if necessary, for generating the label ID or use alternative approaches provided by Django.

This change will make the `MultiWidget` class more flexible and in line with other widgets like `ChoiceWidget`, enhancing overall customization and consistency.
