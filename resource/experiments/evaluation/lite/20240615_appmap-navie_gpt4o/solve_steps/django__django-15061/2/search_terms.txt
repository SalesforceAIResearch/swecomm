<issue>
Remove "for = ..." from MultiWidget's <label>.
Description
	
The instance from Raw MultiWidget class generate id_for_label like f'{id_}0'
It has not sense.
For example ChoiceWidget has self.add_id_index and I can decide it myself, how I will see label_id - with or without index.
I think, it is better to remove completely id_for_label method from MultiWidget Class.
