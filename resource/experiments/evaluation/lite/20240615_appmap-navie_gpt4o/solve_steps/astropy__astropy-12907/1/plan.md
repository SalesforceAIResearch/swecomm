**Title**: Fix incorrect computation of `separability_matrix` for nested CompoundModels

**Problem**:
The `separability_matrix` function in Astropy's modeling module does not compute the separability matrix correctly for nested `CompoundModel` instances. When models are nested, the function incorrectly indicates that the outputs are not separable, even when they actually are.

**Analysis**:
The `separability_matrix` function is designed to compute a boolean correlation matrix that indicates the dependence of outputs on inputs for a given model. It essentially checks whether a model's outputs are independent (separable) such that each output depends on only one input.

The issue arises when the function processes nested `CompoundModels`. For nested models, the internal `_separable` function appears to incorrectly populate the separability matrix, failing to correctly handle models that are deeper in the composition hierarchy. This results in a matrix that wrongly indicates dependencies where there should be none.

The root cause stems from the `_separable` function, which recursively calculates separability based on the model's internal structure. Specifically, it seems the function does not correctly combine separability information from component models when they are nested.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: `astropy/modeling/separable.py`**
    - **Function: `_separable(transform)`**:
      - Update the logic within this function to correctly combine separability matrices for nested models.
      - Ensure the correct handling of both left and right models at each level of a compound model.

2. **Detailed Changes**:
    - Within the `_separable` function, ensure that when handling `CompoundModel` instances, the separability matrices of the left and right components are correctly merged.
    - Modify the logic so that when combining models using the `|` and `&` operators, the resulting separability matrix accurately reflects the independence of outputs for nested structures.
  
**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File: `astropy/modeling/separable.py`**:
    - **Function**: `_separable(transform)`
      - **Update Logic**: Improve the recursive handling of nested `CompoundModel` objects.
      - Ensure that separability matrices are correctly computed and combined for nested structures.
      - When processing a `CompoundModel`, correctly merge the separability matrices of the left and right components, taking the structure into account and retaining the correct dimensions.
