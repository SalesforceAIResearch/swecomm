**Title**: Ensure 'seaborn-colorblind' style is correctly loaded in matplotlib style library

**Problem**: Users are experiencing a `KeyError` when attempting to access the 'seaborn-colorblind' style from `matplotlib.pyplot.style.library` in version 3.6.1, which works in version 3.4.3. This issue suggests that the style is not being correctly loaded into the style library.

**Analysis**: 
- The root cause of the issue is likely that the 'seaborn-colorblind' style is not being loaded due to changes between versions 3.4.3 and 3.6.1.
- The style library is updated via the `reload_library` function, which calls `update_user_library(_base_library)` to load user-defined styles into the `library`.
- The function `read_style_directory` reads the styles from the specified directory and returns a dictionary of these styles. This function might need to be updated or verified to ensure it correctly reads all styles, including 'seaborn-colorblind'.
- The style 'seaborn-colorblind' might not be included in the base styles directory or it might not be correctly updated into the `library`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: lib/matplotlib/style/core.py**
   - **Function: `reload_library`** 
     - Update the `reload_library` function to ensure it includes external or modified styles like 'seaborn-colorblind'.
     - Ensure that during reloading, all styles present in the given paths (base library path and user library paths) are included.

2. **Function: `update_user_library`**
    - Before returning the updated `library`, ensure that a join operation on the `BASE_LIBRARY_PATH` and any additional `USER_LIBRARY_PATHS` correctly updates all user-defined styles, including 'seaborn-colorblind'.

3. **Function: `read_style_directory`**
    - Ensure that all styles, including 'seaborn-colorblind', are correctly parsed and loaded from the provided directories.

**Steps to be taken**:

1. **Extend `reload_library` Functionality**
   - Extend the `reload_library` function to:
     - Load both the default and user style libraries.
     - Ensure the base styles are also included.

2. **Ensure Complete Style Directory Reading**
   - Modify `update_user_library` and `read_style_directory` to ensure they capture all styles and include necessary debug information if styles are skipped or not loaded.

**Detailed Changes**:

1. **Modify `reload_library` in `lib/matplotlib/style/core.py`:**
   - Ensure it combines both base and user libraries.
2. **Modify `update_user_library`:**
   - Ensure it correctly updates all necessary styles from the directories.
3. **Verify `read_style_directory` functionality:**
   - Ensure it captures all necessary styles, including 'seaborn-colorblind' and logs warnings if certain styles are not found.
  
By following these proposed changes, we can ensure that the 'seaborn-colorblind' style, along with other styles, is loaded correctly into the library, thus fixing the `KeyError` issue observed in version 3.6.1.

Please make these changes in the relevant parts of the `lib/matplotlib/style/core.py` file and verify that the issue is resolved.
