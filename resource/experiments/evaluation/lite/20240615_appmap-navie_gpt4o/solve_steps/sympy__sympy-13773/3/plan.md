**Title:** Modify `__matmul__` Method to Restrict Non-Matrix Arguments

**Problem:**
The `__matmul__` method currently allows scalar values to participate in matrix multiplication, which deviates from the expected behavior defined for matrix multiplicationâ€”where both operands should be matrices. This behavior should be restricted to ensure that the `@` (matrix multiplication) operator only works for matrix-matrix multiplications.

**Analysis:**
The current implementation of `__matmul__` simply calls `MatMul(self, other).doit()`, allowing for any type of operand to be included in the matrix multiplication operation. To enforce the correct behavior:
- The `__matmul__` method should be updated to check if both operands are instances of matrix types (e.g., `MatrixBase`).
- If either operand is not a matrix, the method should raise a `TypeError` to indicate that only matrices are allowed in matrix-matrix multiplication.
- This aligns the behavior with NumPy's matrix multiplication rules.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File to Change:** `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`
    - **Method:** `__matmul__`
    - **Logic:** Update the method to include a type check for both `self` and `other` to ensure they are matrix types before proceeding with the multiplication. If either operand is not a matrix, raise a `TypeError`.

  **Detailed Description of Changes:**
  
  - **Validate Types:** Introduce a check that verifies both operands are instances of a matrix type (`MatrixBase`).
  - **Raise Error:** If either operand is not of the correct type, raise a `TypeError` with an appropriate error message.

  Specifically, in the `__matmul__` method:
  - Add type checking for `self` and `other`.
  - Update the method to raise an error when the type check fails.



**Outcome:**
By implementing these changes, the `__matmul__` method will enforce that matrix multiplication is only performed between matrix objects, raising errors when non-matrix operands are used, thus conforming to the expected matrix multiplication behavior.
