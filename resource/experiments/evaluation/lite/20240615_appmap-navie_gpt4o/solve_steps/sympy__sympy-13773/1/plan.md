**Title**: Restrict `__matmul__` to only allow matrix operands

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `@` operator (`__matmul__`) in the `MatrixExpr` class does not enforce that both operands are matrices. As a result, scalar operands are incorrectly allowed, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior and standards, such as those followed by NumPy.

**Analysis**:
The issue lies in how the `__matmul__` operator is currently implemented. It reuses the multiplication logic (`__mul__`), which does not distinguish between scalar and matrix operands. To rectify this, the `__matmul__` logic should impose a check to ensure that both operands are indeed matrices. If either operand is not a matrix, a `ValueError` should be raised. This will ensure that matrix multiplication using the `@` operator behaves consistently and as expected.

**Proposed Changes**:
To enforce that both operands of the `__matmul__` operator are matrices, we need to modify the `__matmul__` method in the `MatrixExpr` class. Specifically, we will add a check to confirm that both operands are instances of matrix classes. If not, a `ValueError` will be raised.

File: `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`

1. **Modify the `__matmul__` Method**:
   - Add type checks to verify that both operands are instances of matrix classes.
   - Raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message if either operand is not a matrix.

Here are the specific changes:

- **File**: `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`
  - **Function**: `__matmul__(self, other)`

Update the `__matmul__` method as follows:

1. **Add Type Check for Matrix Operands**:
   - After fetching the `self` and `other` operands, check if both are instances of matrix classes (`Matrix`, `MatrixExpr`, etc.).
   - If either operand is not a matrix, raise a `ValueError`.

2. **Raise Error if Operands Are Not Matrices**:
   - Raise an error message similar to NumPy's implementation: `"Scalar operands are not allowed; use '*' instead"`.

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Open the `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py` file.**

2. **Locate the `__matmul__` Method Definition**:
   - The method is defined around lines 120-130.

3. **Add Type Check**:
   

4. **Save the Changes**:
   - Ensure the changes are saved to enforce the new behavior.

By making these modifications, the `@` operator will only work for matrix multiplication and will raise an error for scalar operands, aligning its behavior with expectations and standards like those of NumPy.
