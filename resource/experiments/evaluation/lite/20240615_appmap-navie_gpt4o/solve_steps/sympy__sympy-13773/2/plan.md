**Title**: Update `__matmul__` to Restrict Arguments to Matrix Types

**Problem**:
The `__matmul__` method in the Sympy `Matrix` class currently allows scalar operands, which is inconsistent with the behavior of matrix multiplication. Specifically, Sympy's `@` (matrix multiplication) operator works with scalars, which is incorrect. It should raise an error if one of the operands is not a matrix, similar to how NumPy behaves.

**Analysis**:
The current implementation of the `__matmul__` method copies the behavior of the `__mul__` method, allowing scalar multiplication. However, matrix multiplication should only be valid between two matrix types. 

To align with expected behavior, a validation step should be introduced in `__matmul__` to ensure both operands are matrices. If a scalar is detected, the method should raise a `ValueError`, instructing users to use the `*` operator for scalar multiplication instead.

**Proposed Changes**:
File to be modified: `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`

1. **Modify `__matmul__` Method**:
   - Add a check to ensure that both `self` and `other` are of matrix types.
   - If `other` is not a matrix, raise a `ValueError` with an appropriate message.

Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Edit `__matmul__` Method in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`**:
   - Before performing the multiplication, add a check to ensure `other` is a matrix type (e.g., an instance of `MatrixBase`).
   - Raise a `ValueError` if `other` is not a matrix type.

   
   
   **Example Changes**:

   - Modify the existing `__matmul__` method to include type checking:
      - Introduce a type check for `self` and `other`
      - Raise a `ValueError` if `other` is not an instance of `MatrixBase`.

2. **Error Message**:
   - Ensure that the `ValueError` message is clear and suggests using the `*` operator for scalar multiplication. This will help users understand how to correctly perform scalar multiplications.

This change maintains consistency within the Sympy library and aligns its matrix multiplication behavior with that of NumPy, making it more predictable and easier to use for those familiar with standard matrix operations.
