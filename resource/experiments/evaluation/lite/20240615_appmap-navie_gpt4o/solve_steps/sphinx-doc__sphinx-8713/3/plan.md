**Title**: Synchronize "Other Parameters" Section Formatting with `napoleon_use_param` Configuration

**Problem**
Currently, the "Other Parameters" section in the Sphinx Napoleon extension is always formatted as if `napoleon_use_param` was set to `False`, which results in inconsistent formatting compared to the "Parameters" section. This discrepancy can lead to confusion when reading the generated documentation.

**Analysis**
The `napoleon_use_param` configuration flag controls whether individual parameters are formatted using the `:param:` and `:type:` roles or a single consolidated field for all parameters. This logic is correctly applied to the "Parameters" section but not to the "Other Parameters" section. The relevant parsing functions should exhibit uniform behavior based on the `napoleon_use_param` setting.

**Proposed Changes**
To address this issue, the `_parse_other_parameters_section` method should be updated to format the "Other Parameters" section similarly to how the "Parameters" section is formatted, respecting the `napoleon_use_param` flag.

1. **File**: `sphinx/ext/napoleon/docstring.py`

   **Changes**:
   
   - Update the `_parse_other_parameters_section` to check the `napoleon_use_param` configuration and format the fields accordingly.
   
   
   
 
   The function will now follow the same logic as `_parse_parameters_section`. This ensures consistency in how both sections are rendered, based on the `napoleon_use_param` configuration. With this change, the functionality for handling the `napoleon_use_param` flag becomes uniform across different sections.

By making the above change, the "Other Parameters" section will respect the `napoleon_use_param` flag, resulting in consistent formatting across the entire documentation.

**Conclusion**
Applying this change will enhance the readability and consistency of the generated documentation, aligning the formatting of the "Other Parameters" section with the rest of the parameter sections when `napoleon_use_param` is enabled.
