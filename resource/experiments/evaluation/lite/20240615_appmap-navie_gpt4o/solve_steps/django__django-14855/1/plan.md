### Update the get_admin_url Method to Include current_app Parameter

**Problem:**
When a model containing a ForeignKey field is viewed or edited in a custom Admin Site, and that ForeignKey field is listed in `readonly_fields`, the URL generated for the link defaults to `/admin/...` instead of the custom admin site prefix `/custom-admin/...`.

**Analysis:**
The issue stems from the `get_admin_url` method in `django.contrib.admin.helpers` which uses:

This lacks the `current_app` parameter, causing the URL to fall back to the default admin site prefix.

**Proposed Changes:**
To resolve the issue and ensure the URL points to the correct custom admin site prefix, the `get_admin_url` method should be updated to include the `current_app` parameter. The correct Admin Site name will be derived from `self.model_admin.admin_site.name`.

Here are the changes you need to make:

1. **File: django/contrib/admin/helpers.py**
   - **Method to Modify: `get_admin_url`**

Update the current implementation of the method to include the `current_app` parameter while calling the `reverse` function.

#### Updated Method Logic:
1. **Retrieve the Admin Site name:** Extract the current Admin Site name from `self.model_admin.admin_site.name`.
2. **Add current_app parameter:** Update the `reverse` function call to include the `current_app` parameter.
  
#### Change:


By including `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name`, you ensure that the correct URL prefix is used, accurately reflecting the current Admin Site.

Make the proposed change in the specified file and method. Test the updated functionality to ensure it resolves the issue without introducing any side effects.

### Conclusion:
This update will modify the `get_admin_url` method to respect the custom Admin Site prefix by correctly using the `current_app` parameter in the `reverse` function call. This ensures that URLs generated for readonly ForeignKey fields in custom Admin Sites will be accurate.
