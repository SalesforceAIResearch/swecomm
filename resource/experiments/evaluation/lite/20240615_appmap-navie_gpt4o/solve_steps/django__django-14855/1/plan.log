according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

Wrong URL generated by get_admin_url for readonly field in custom Admin Site
Description
	
When a model containing a ForeignKey field is viewed (or edited) in a custom Admin Site, and that ForeignKey field is listed in readonly_fields, the url generated for the link is /admin/... instead of /custom-admin/....

url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])

I have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:
url = reverse(
