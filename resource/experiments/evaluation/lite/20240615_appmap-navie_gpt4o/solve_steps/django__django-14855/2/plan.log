according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

Wrong URL generated by get_admin_url for readonly field in custom Admin Site
Description
	
When a model containing a ForeignKey field is viewed (or edited) in a custom Admin Site, and that ForeignKey field is listed in readonly_fields, the url generated for the link is /admin/... instead of /custom-admin/....
This appears to be caused by the following line in django.contrib.admin.helpers get_admin_url:
url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])
Other parts of the admin use the current_app keyword parameter to identify the correct current name of the Admin Site. (See django.contrib.admin.options.ModelAdmin response_add as just one example)
I have been able to correct this specific issue by replacing the above line with:
url = reverse(
	url_name,
	args=[quote(... (1053)
