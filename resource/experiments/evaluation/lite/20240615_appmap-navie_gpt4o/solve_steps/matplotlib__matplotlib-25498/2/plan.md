**Title**: Fix colorbar update issue after changing the norm instance of a mappable object

**Problem**: 
When updating the norm instance of a `ScalarMappable` object and then attempting to update its associated colorbar, the method `colorbar.update_normal(mappable)` has no effect. Using `colorbar.update_bruteforce(mappable)` throws a `ZeroDivisionError` exception. The colorbar does not reflect the changes made to the normalization.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue lies in how the norm is being updated and subsequently processed by the colorbar in Matplotlib. Specifically, the `colorbar.update_normal(mappable)` method is not designed to handle changes to the norm dynamically. Additionally, `colorbar.update_bruteforce(mappable)` leads to a `ZeroDivisionError` when it tries to perform calculations involving the previous norm values that are now outdated or invalid due to the changed norm instance.

The intended method to update the norm is to ensure the norm is set correctly and then call internally consistent colorbar update methods. 

**Proposed Changes**:
The file `lib/matplotlib/cm.py` should be modified to handle changes in the norm of a `ScalarMappable` object and ensure that the associated colorbar reflects these changes correctly. Specifically, update the `changed` and norm-handling logic to manage norm updates gracefully.

1. **lib/matplotlib/cm.py:**
   - Update the `changed` method to handle new norm values without causing errors:
     
   - Modify the initialization method of `ScalarMappable` to handle cases where `norm` is set dynamically and ensure it uses updated limits if provided:
     

Applying these changes should ensure that when the norm of a `ScalarMappable` object is updated, the colorbar can correctly adapt to the new norm values without causing errors, such as `ZeroDivisionError`.
