### Title
Fix the limit computation for Bell numbers to return infinity

### Problem
`bell(n).limit(n, oo)` should evaluate to infinity (`oo`), but the current implementation returns an unevaluated expression `bell(oo)`. For large values of `n`, the Bell numbers (representing the number of ways to partition a set of `n` elements) should naturally tend towards infinity. A similar issue was recently fixed for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers.

### Analysis
The root cause of the issue lies in the limit computation for the Bell numbers within the Sympy library. The current implementation does not consider the growth behavior of the Bell numbers as `n` approaches infinity. To resolve this, we need to modify the function responsible for evaluating Bell numbers and ensure it correctly returns `oo` when the limit is taken as `n` approaches infinity.

**Steps to resolve the issue:**
1. Check for any existing limit handling functions for special sequences like Fibonacci and Lucas numbers as a reference.
2. Modify the Bell number function to handle the limit evaluation specifically for when `n` tends to infinity.
3. Ensure that the `limit` method for the Bell number function is overridden if necessary to return `oo` directly for `n` tending to infinity.

### Proposed Changes
The changes should be made in the `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py` file, where the Bell numbers are likely implemented. 

1. **Modify Bell Function Class:**
   - Locate the class definition for the Bell numbers in `sympy/functions/combinatorial/numbers.py`.
   - Add or modify the `_eval_as_leading_term` method to return `oo` when the argument tends to infinity.
   - If a similar mechanism as the one used for Fibonacci and Lucas numbers exists, replicate or adapt that logic.



2. **Handle Limit Evaluations:**
   - Override the `_eval_limit` method if it exists, or directly handle within `_eval_as_leading_term` to check for the limit case where the argument is infinity (`oo`).

By implementing the above changes, the Bell number limit computation will be corrected to return `oo` when `n` tends to infinity.
