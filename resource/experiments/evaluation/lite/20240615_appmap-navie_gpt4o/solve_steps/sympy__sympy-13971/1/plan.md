**Title**: Modify SeqFormula rendering to prevent backslash escaping of square brackets

**Problem**: The current rendering of `SeqFormula` in Jupyter notebooks backslash-escapes square brackets, resulting in improper rendering when the output is copied to a markdown cell. The backslash-escaped brackets `\left\[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots\right\]` do not render correctly in markdown cells, whereas `[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots ]` renders properly.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the square brackets used for the sequence output in `SeqFormula` are being backslash-escaped due to the LaTeX rendering settings. The escape characters for brackets are causing errors in markdown cells where such escaping is not required or expected. To resolve this, the method in the sympy library responsible for the LaTeX printing of sequences needs to be adjusted to avoid escaping square brackets.

Modifying the code to avoid backslash-escaping square brackets for sequences while utilizing `SeqFormula` will retain the correct rendering in both Jupyter notebooks and markdown cells. 

**Proposed Changes**:
To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the `SeqFormula` rendering logic. We'll focus on changing the rendering logic within the `sympy` library, specifically targeting the method responsible for converting the `SeqFormula` to LaTeX format.

1. **File**: `sympy/printing/latex.py`
   - **Function**: `_print_SeqFormula`
   - **Modification**: Update the LaTeX representation logic for `SeqFormula` to prevent backslash-escaping of square brackets.

   Steps:
   - Locate the `_print_SeqFormula` or equivalent function which handles the LaTeX conversion of `SeqFormula`.
   - Adjust the string construction to use standard square brackets `[ ]` instead of their escaped versions `\[ \]`.

This adjustment ensures that output from `SeqFormula` follows the correct LaTeX conventions for sequences and prevents backslash escaping of brackets which is not needed in typical usage environments.

2. **Example**: 
   

By performing this change, outputs like `\left[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots\right]` will no longer contain unnecessary backslashes, resolving the rendering issue in markdown cells while maintaining proper display in LaTeX.

Make sure to thoroughly test this change within a Jupyter notebook, including copying the output to markdown cells, to confirm that the rendering behaves as expected.

**Note**: Adjustments should be carefully tested to ensure that the rendering of other LaTeX components is not adversely affected.
