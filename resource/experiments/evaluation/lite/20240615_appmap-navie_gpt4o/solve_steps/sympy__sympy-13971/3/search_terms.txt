Generate a list of all file names, module names, class names, function names and varable names that are mentioned in the
described issue. Do not emit symbols that are part of the programming language itself. Do not emit symbols that are part

Display of SeqFormula()
```
import sympy as sp
k, m, n = sp.symbols('k m n', integer=True)
sp.init_printing()

sp.SeqFormula(n**2, (n,0,sp.oo))
```

The Jupyter rendering of this command backslash-escapes the brackets producing:

`\left\[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots\right\]`

Copying this output to a markdown cell this does not render properly.  Whereas:

`[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots ]`

does render just fine.  

So - sequence output should not backslash-escape square brackets, or, `\]` should instead render?
