**Title**: Fix `SeqFormula` Display to Avoid Escape of Square Brackets

**Problem**:
When displaying sequences using `SeqFormula` in a Jupyter notebook with SymPy, the output uses backslash-escaped square brackets (`\[` and `\]`). This output does not render properly when copied to a markdown cell. Instead, the sequence should display with plain square brackets (`[0, 1, 4, 9, \ldots]`) which render correctly in most markdown environments.

**Analysis**:
The output formatting issue for `SeqFormula` is likely due to the way the `str` or `repr` function is implemented within the SymPy library, specifically within the relevant printer class that handles sequence formatting. The escaping is redundant and affects the display when copying the output to different environments like markdown cells in Jupyter notebooks. 

The main objective is to ensure that the printing method for `SeqFormula` or its underlying structures does not escape the square brackets.

**Proposed Changes**:
The `SeqFormula` class' output formatting logic that introduces the backslash escape characters needs modification. The fix involves ensuring that the print method for sequences does not apply escaping to square brackets.

This change also likely needs to be applied at the level where sequences are printed, possibly within a related printing class (e.g., `StrPrinter` or a subclass specifically handling sequences) to ensure that all sequences are output in an appropriate format. Below are the required changes:

1. **File: sympy/printing/python.py**
  - Modify the `_print_SeqFormula` method or introduce one if not present. This method should format the sequence output with plain square brackets and no backslashes.

Suggested Change:


2. **File: sympy/printing/codeprinter.py**
  - Verify or create a similar `_print_SeqFormula` method in `CodePrinter` or the respective printer class responsible for sequence formatting. This ensures consistency across different backends that may use code-based printers.

Suggested Change:


The change should involve:


By making these changes, the sequence will be displayed with plain square brackets, solving the issue of incorrect rendering in markdown cells.
