**Title**: Fix URLField to Raise ValidationError Instead of ValueError

**Problem**:
The `forms.URLField.clean()` method throws a `ValueError` instead of a `ValidationError` when provided with certain invalid URLs, such as '////]@N.AN'. This issue occurs specifically during the URL validation process where invalid IPv6 addresses are not properly captured and converted into a `ValidationError`.

**Analysis**:
The root of the issue lies in the `django.core.validators.URLValidator` class, where the `__call__` method does not properly handle ValueErrors thrown when parsing the URL. The `urlsplit` function from the `urllib.parse` module throws a `ValueError` for corrupted URLs, but this error is not caught and transformed into a `ValidationError` as it should be. 

The solution involves modifying the `__call__` method of `URLValidator` to catch the `ValueError` and raise a `ValidationError` instead. 

**Proposed Changes**:
The file to be modified: `django/core/validators.py`.

1. Locate the `URLValidator` class. This class inherits from `RegexValidator` and validates URLs using a regex pattern and additional logic.
   
2. In the `__call__` method of `URLValidator`, find the section where the URL is split using `urlsplit`.

3. Update the try-except block that catches `ValidationError` to also catch `ValueError`.

4. Transform any caught `ValueError` into a `ValidationError` with an appropriate error message, code, and params.

Detailed proposed change to `django/core/validators.py`:

- Modify the `__call__` method:
  - Inside the try-except block where `urlsplit` is called, add a new except clause to catch `ValueError`.
  - Raise a `ValidationError` within this new except clause, providing a meaningful message and the relevant invalid value.

This modification will ensure that any `ValueError` encountered during URL parsing will be converted into a `ValidationError`, thus maintaining consistent behavior for invalid input handling in `forms.URLField.clean()`.

The developer should verify existing behavior with appropriate test cases to ensure the modification works as intended and does not introduce side effects. If there are no existing test cases for this scenario, adding them would be beneficial. However, adding or modifying test case files is beyond the scope of this change plan.
