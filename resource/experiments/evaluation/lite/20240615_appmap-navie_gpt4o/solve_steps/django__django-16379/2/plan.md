**Title:** Fix Race Condition in FileBasedCache `has_key` Method

**Problem:**
The `has_key` method in the `FileBasedCache` class is prone to a race condition. This occurs because there is a window between checking for the existence of the cache file and attempting to open it. During this window, the file could be deleted or altered by another thread or process, leading to a `FileNotFoundError`.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the race condition is the time gap between calling `os.path.exists()` and `open()`. During this gap, the cache file might be deleted, potentially by the `_is_expired` method or another external process. This situation frequently leads to `FileNotFoundError`.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that once the file's existence is confirmed, any subsequent operations on it (like reading its content) are safe. This can be achieved by handling exceptions properly when opening the file and checking within the open block whether the file is actually expired.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. Modify the `has_key` method:
   - Avoid relying solely on `os.path.exists` to verify file existence.
   - Handle the `FileNotFoundError` exception during file open.
   - Within the open block, check the expiration status and return the result accordingly.

**Suggested Code Changes:**

*File: django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py*

1. **Update Method: `has_key`**

   **Current Method:**
   

   **Proposed Updated Method:**
   

   **Detailed Description of Changes:**
   - In the updated `has_key` method, the existence check (`os.path.exists`) is removed.
   - The file is directly opened inside a try block, and any `FileNotFoundError` is caught and handled.
   - Within the try block, the `_is_expired` method is called to check if the cache is expired. If it is not expired, `True` is returned. If the file is either non-existent or expired (which leads to its deletion within `_is_expired`), `False` is returned.

2. **Testing the Changes:**
   - Ensure manual testing of the method to check behavior in multi-threaded scenarios.
   - Verify all existing tests pass, as existing test cases for `has_key` should cover general behavior.
   - Add or verify test cases to ensure race conditions are handled correctly (though this should be handled outside this task scope).

By implementing the above changes, the `has_key` method should reliably avoid race conditions, ensuring the cache file operations are safer and more robust.
