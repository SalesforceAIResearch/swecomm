**Title:** Fix Race Condition in FileBasedCache `has_key` Method

**Problem:**  
The `has_key` method in `FileBasedCache` is vulnerable to a race condition. Specifically, a file can be deleted between the check for its existence (`os.path.exists(fname)`) and its subsequent opening (`open(fname, "rb")`). This leads to a `FileNotFoundError`. The issue is exacerbated by the `_is_expired` method, which can delete the file if it's expired, making the problem more likely in multi-threaded environments.

**Analysis:**  
The root cause of the issue is the time interval between checking for the file's existence and attempting to open it. During this interval, there's no guarantee that the file will remain, leading to a possible `FileNotFoundError` when the `open` call executes.

To resolve this, we need a mechanism that atomically checks for the file's existence and its validity (non-expiration) within a single critical section, ensuring no deletions happen in between. This can be achieved by implementing file locking before checking for the file's existence and maintaining the lock through the file opening and expiration check process.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Import File Locking Utilities:** Utilize Django's `locks` utilities for file locking.
2. **Revise `has_key` Method:**
   - Acquire an exclusive lock on the file.
   - Check if the file exists.
   - Open the file and check if it is expired.
   - Ensure locks are properly released in a `finally` block to avoid deadlocking.

**djangp/core/cache/backends/filebased.py:**
- **Function `has_key`:** 
  1. Acquire a lock on the file.
  2. Modify the existing logic to include file locking before the existence check and while handling the file.
  3. Release the lock after the check.

**Detailed changes:**

1. **Add `from django.core.files import locks` import**:
   - Ensure the file locking utilities are available in `filebased.py`.

2. **Modify the `has_key` method**:
   - Integrate file locking to ensure atomic operations around existence check and file open.

Here is a step-by-step description of what the logic should look like:

**Before Changes:**


**After Changes:**
- Wrap the existence check and open in a try-except block, ensuring file locks are acquired before checking and maintained until done with the file.



This change ensures that between checking if the file exists and opening it, there is no window for the file to be deleted by another process, fixing the race condition and preventing `FileNotFoundError`.

By making these changes, the `has_key` method is less prone to race conditions due to atomic locking, ensuring thread safety in multi-threaded environments.
