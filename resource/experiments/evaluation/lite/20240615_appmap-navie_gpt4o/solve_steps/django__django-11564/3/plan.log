**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Add support for SCRIPT_NAME in STATIC_URL and MEDIA_URL
Description
	 
		(last modified by Rostyslav Bryzgunov)
	 
By default, {% static '...' %} tag just appends STATIC_URL in the path. When running on sub-path, using SCRIPT_NAME WSGI param, it results in incorrect static URL - it doesn't prepend SCRIPT_NAME prefix.
This problem can be solved with prepending SCRIPT_NAME to STATIC_URL in settings.py but that doesn't work when SCRIPT_NAME is a dynamic value.
This can be easily added into default Django static tag and django.contrib.staticfiles tag as following:
def render(self, context):
	url = self.url(context)
	# Updating url here with request.META['SCRIPT_NAME'] 
	if self.varname is None:
		return url
	context[self.varname] = url
		return ''
