**Title**: Ensure ModelForm fields with callable defaults correctly propagate default values in Django admin inlines

**Problem**:
When creating objects via Django admin using inlines that contain a field with a callable default value (like `ArrayField`), if the form submission initially fails due to a validation error, the inline fields are incorrectly reset on the subsequent submission, causing loss of the initial value.

**Analysis**:
The root of the problem is that the second form submission skips validation for the inline due to the incorrect handling of initial values in hidden input fields. Specifically, when the initial value is a callable (e.g., `list`), Django does not correctly propagate this default value on form re-render when it's marked as hidden.

The field's `show_hidden_initial` attribute causes the issue because the hidden inputs created for initial values may not correctly represent callable defaults. This leads to instances where the form appears clean even when it isn't, effectively bypassing validation for the inline.

To solve this, the attribute `show_hidden_initial` needs to be explicitly set to `False` for fields with callable defaults in the form's initialization process. This will ensure that the initial values are correctly handled and presented on subsequent form submissions.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/forms/formsets.py`
    - Modify the form initialization to detect fields with callable defaults and set `show_hidden_initial` to `False`.
    - Specifically, in the method where the form is constructed (`_construct_form`), update the field definitions if they are callable and set the `show_hidden_initial` attribute.

Example steps:
  - In the `_construct_form` method:
    - Iterate through form fields and check if the default value is callable.
    - If so, set `show_hidden_initial` to `False`.

In the file `django/forms/formsets.py`, adopt the following modification:

### Method: `_construct_form`:
- Add logic to check if a field's default is callable and set `show_hidden_initial`.

**Suggested Changes**:


    # Allow extra forms to be empty, unless they're part of
    # the minimum forms.
    if i >= self.initial_form_count() and i >= self.min_num:
        defaults["empty_permitted"] = True
    defaults.update(kwargs)
    form = self.form(**defaults)
    
    # New logic: Adjust show_hidden_initial for callable defaults
    for field_name, field in form.fields.items():
        if callable(field.initial):
            field.show_hidden_initial = False
    
    self.add_fields(form, i)
    return form
```

By explicitly setting `show_hidden_initial` to `False`, callable default values will correctly propagate on subsequent form submissions, ensuring form validation behaves as expected.

**Conclusion**:
With these changes, the issue of callable default values not propagating in Django admin inlines on subsequent form submissions will be resolved, preserving the initial values correctly and ensuring valid behavior across form submissions.
