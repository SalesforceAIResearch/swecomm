### Title

Fix DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD subclass check to include subclasses of BigAutoField and SmallAutoField

### Problem

When setting the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to a custom subclass of `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField`, Django crashes with a `ValueError` indicating that the primary key must subclass `AutoField`.

### Analysis

The problem trace reveals that the error occurs during the model preparation phase when Django checks if the default auto field specified in `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is a valid subclass of `AutoField`. The current check does not recognize that `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`, which are themselves subclasses of `AutoField`, can have their own subclasses that should be valid primary keys. 

The error message is generated by the method `_get_default_pk_class` in the `django.db.models.options.Options` class, which likely relies on Python's `issubclass` check. This check falls back on the `__subclasscheck__` method of the metaclass `AutoFieldMeta`. Here, the `_subclasses` property of `AutoFieldMeta` seems to only include `AutoField` but not its descendants `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.

To solve this, the `__subclasscheck__` implementation in `AutoFieldMeta` needs to be adjusted to recognize subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid.

### Proposed Changes

**File:** `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`

1. **Locate the AutoFieldMeta class**:
   - Find the `AutoFieldMeta` class used as a metaclass for `AutoField`.

2. **Enhance the __subclasscheck__ function**:
   - Update its logic to ensure that subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are recognized as valid subclasses of `AutoField`.
   
   Modify the `_subclasses` property to include references to `BigAutoField`, `SmallAutoField`, and their subclasses:
   
   

3. **Verify that BigAutoField and SmallAutoField are being used in the check**:
   - Ensure that the `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` classes are imported in `django.db.models.options` where required.

By ensuring these subclass checks accommodate `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` and their subclasses, the issue with `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` validation will be resolved, and thus Django will handle such configurations without raising an exception.

Implementing this fix will make sure that custom fields inheriting from `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are recognized properly, thus preventing the erroneous `ValueError` when setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`.
