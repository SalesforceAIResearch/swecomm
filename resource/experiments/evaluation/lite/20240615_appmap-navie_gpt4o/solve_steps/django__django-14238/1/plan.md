**Title**: Fix `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` subclass check for `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` subclasses

**Problem**: The current implementation of the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` check does not properly recognize subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid primary keys. When attempting to set `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to a custom subclass of `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField`, Django raises a `ValueError`, preventing the application from starting.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue lies in the `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` method. This method is responsible for verifying whether a given class is a subclass of `AutoField`. However, it does not account for subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. To resolve this issue, we need to modify the logic in `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` to consider these subclasses as valid.

**Proposed Changes**: 

1. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`
   - Modify the `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` method to include a check for subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.

2. **Implementation Details**:
   - Identify the `_subclasses` property within the `AutoFieldMeta` class.
   - Update the logic to recognize subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid subclasses of `AutoField`.

Here is a detailed description of the necessary change:

- Locate the `AutoFieldMeta` class within `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`.
- In the `__subclasscheck__` method, extend the `_subclasses` property to include `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.
- Ensure that the custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` will be recognized during the type-check process.

By performing these changes, custom primary keys defined as subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` will be correctly identified, resolving the issue.
