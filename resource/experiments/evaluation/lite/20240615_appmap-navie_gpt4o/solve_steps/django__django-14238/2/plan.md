### Title
Fix DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD subclass check to allow subclasses of BigAutoField and SmallAutoField

### Problem
When setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in Django to a subclass of `models.BigAutoField` or `models.SmallAutoField`, Django crashes with a `ValueError` during the application startup. The error indicates that the primary key referred to by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`.

### Analysis
The root cause of the issue lies in how Django checks if the specified `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is a valid subclass of `AutoField`. Currently, the check validates directly against `AutoField`, but does not account for subclasses such as `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. This check needs to be updated to allow subclasses of these fields by including them in the `_subclasses` property of `AutoFieldMeta`.

### Proposed Changes
Modify the subclass check mechanism in `AutoFieldMeta` to include subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.

Update the following file:

#### File: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`
1. Update the `_subclasses` set in the `AutoFieldMeta` to include `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.
2. Ensure that the `__subclasscheck__` method accounts for these new classes.

Description of necessary changes:
1. Locate the `AutoFieldMeta` class definition.
2. Update the `_subclasses` set to include `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` along with the `AutoField`.
3. Ensure that the `__subclasscheck__` method checks against the updated `_subclasses` set which now includes `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as well.

By making these changes, the validation will correctly recognize subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid settings for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD`, preventing the application from crashing during startup.
