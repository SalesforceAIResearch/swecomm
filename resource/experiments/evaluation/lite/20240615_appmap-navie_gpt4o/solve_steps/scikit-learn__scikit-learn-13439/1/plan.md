**Title**: Implement `__len__` method for the Pipeline class

**Problem**: 
Currently, the `Pipeline` class in scikit-learn does not support the `__len__` method. Consequently, the user cannot directly determine the length of a `Pipeline` object, and attempting to use indexing such as `pipe[:len(pipe)]` will result in an error. This issue needs a change to implement the `__len__` method for the `Pipeline` class.

**Analysis**:
The lack of the `__len__` method in the `Pipeline` class means the user cannot determine the number of steps in the pipeline using the Pythonic `len` function. Adding support for this method can improve usability by allowing straightforward length querying and by enabling Python's slicing capabilities to work as expected.

The `Pipeline` object consists of a list of tuples, with each tuple containing the name and the instance of the component. For example, in a pipeline defined as `Pipeline([('step1', transformer1), ('step2', transformer2)])`, the internal storage might look like `[('step1', transformer1), ('step2', transformer2)]`.

**Proposed Changes**:
We will modify the `Pipeline` class to include a `__len__` method that returns the length of its internal list of steps.

1. **File to Modify**:
   - `sklearn/pipeline.py`

2. **Changes**:
   - Locate the `Pipeline` class.
   - Add the `__len__` method to the class.
   - This method should return the length of the internal list that holds the pipeline steps (`self.steps`).

**Detailed Steps**:

1. **Locate the Pipeline Class**:
   - Open the `sklearn/pipeline.py` file.
   - Locate the definition of the `Pipeline` class.

2. **Add `__len__` Method**:
   - Implement the `__len__` method in the `Pipeline` class.
   - This method should return the length of `self.steps`.



By implementing the above change, the `Pipeline` class will now support the `__len__` method, and the user will be able to call `len(pipe)` to get the number of steps in the pipeline, resolving the reported issue.
