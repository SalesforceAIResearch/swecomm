**Title**: Fix the `eval_expr` method to prevent executing `repr` outputs of unknown objects

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `eval_expr` function in SymPy uses the `eval` function to execute code, which can execute `repr` outputs of unknown objects passed to SymPy functions. This is unsafe and can lead to unexpected `AttributeError`s when attributes are not found or worse, arbitrary code execution.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is within the `eval_expr` function that executes the code string using `eval`:

By executing this code string, any malicious or erroneous string can cause unintended behavior. Specifically, the `eval` function could attempt to access attributes that do not exist on objects, leading to `AttributeError`, as seen in the user's report.

To avoid this, the `eval_expr` function should be modified to safely parse and evaluate only valid SymPy expressions. Strings produced by unknown objects' `repr` method should be treated cautiously.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py - `eval_expr` function**: Modify the `eval_expr` function to ensure it only evaluates safe expressions by:
    - Validating the `code` string before evaluation.
    - Using a safer method to interpret the string for SymPy expressions.

**Details of Changes**:
1. **sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py - `eval_expr` function**:
    - Introduce a validation step to ensure that the code string contains only valid SymPy expressions.
    - Convert the code string into a SymPy expression in a safe manner, avoiding the direct use of `eval`.

    Change the `eval_expr` function as follows:
    
    Modify the current code as follows:
    
    - Validate the `code` string using SymPy's own parsing functions to ensure it contains only acceptable content.
    - Use SymPy's safe evaluation methods after validation.
    
    Detailed Steps:
    
    1. Parse the `code` string using SymPy's parser to ensure it is a valid expression.
    2. Replace direct `eval` usage with SymPy's internal methods for converting strings to expressions safely.
    
    

By validating the code string before evaluation and using secure code execution practices, we mitigate the risk associated with `repr` outputs of unknown objects leading to unintended behaviors or errors.

This change ensures only valid SymPy expressions are evaluated, making the parser robust against potentially malicious input.
