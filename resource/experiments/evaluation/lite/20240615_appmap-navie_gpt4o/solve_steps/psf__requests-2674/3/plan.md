**Title**: Wrap urllib3 exceptions DecodeError and TimeoutError in requests.exceptions

**Problem**

When using the requests API, some exceptions from the underlying urllib3 library, specifically `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`, are not wrapped in corresponding `requests.exceptions` types. This requires users to catch both urllib3 and requests exceptions, which is not ideal for API consistency.

**Analysis**

To provide a more seamless exception handling experience for users of the requests library, it would be beneficial to wrap these urllib3 exceptions in requests-specific exceptions. This practice ensures that users only need to handle exceptions from the requests library and not worry about the underlying urllib3 implementation details.

The exceptions that need wrapping are:

1. `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`
2. `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`

We should create corresponding exceptions in `requests.exceptions` and ensure that any place in the requests library where these exceptions might be raised, they are caught and re-thrown as their requests equivalents.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **Define New Exceptions in `requests.exceptions`:**

   Add new exception classes in the `requests.exceptions` module to represent `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.

   - Add a class `RequestsDecodeError` inheriting from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`.
   - Add a class `RequestsTimeoutError` inheriting from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError`.

2. **Wrap Exceptions in Appropriate Locations:**

   Identify locations where `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` might be raised and wrap them with the newly defined exceptions.

### Detailed Changes:

**File: `requests/exceptions.py`**

1. Add new exception classes:

   

**In appropriate places within the `requests` package (e.g., `requests.adapters.py`, `requests.sessions.py`, etc.):**

1. Look for code blocks where urllib3's `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are raised and wrap them in the corresponding requests exceptions:

   

By making these changes, the user will only need to deal with exceptions from the `requests.exceptions` module, making exception handling much simpler and more consistent.

This approach maintains clear separation and encapsulation, adhering to the principle of hiding the complexity of underlying libraries from the end-users of the `requests` library.
