The test error details suggest that we are failing on `test_requests.py::RequestsTestCase::test_conflicting_post_params`. This implies a possible issue with handling conditions where POST parameters conflict in the `requests` library. The issue might be deeply related to exception handling. 

Given the exceptions described, it seems there might be a conflict or inconsistency in one of `HTTPError`, `ConnectionError`, or other related exceptions. We need to ensure that these are correctly handled in all scenarios, especially the ones which `requests` library deems crucial (like timeouts, SSL errors etc.).

Reviewing the provided snippets, a potential improvement in exception handling modules can be to ensure those have a more comprehensive message considering conflicting scenarios and parameters (if not already covered).

Here's a case where `RetryError` involved can be a composite of various other exceptions also giving way to this failure as RequestException could be too ambiguous. Updating `RequestException` class to appropriately draw/bifurcate causes/reasons could be helpful:

        return f"RequestException: {self.message}"

</change>

### Change 2

Reviewing, incorporating and making RetryError more verbose to give detailed context.

<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="2">requests/exceptions.py</file>
<original line-count="14" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class RetryError(RequestException):
    """Custom retries logic failed"""

    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self.message = kwargs.pop('message', "Retries exceeded")
        super(RetryError, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"RetryError: {self.message}"
]]></modified>
</change>

These modifications can present more insightful logs when exceptions arise, especially in relation to requests handling, giving a cleaner understanding and resolution path.

Lastly, confirm that the enhanced exception handling aligns well with failing test cases, making adjustments, if needed. This effort ensures consistency and utility for broader use cases like in HTTP calls, decoding errors or retry logics explicitly.
