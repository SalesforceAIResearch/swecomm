**Title**: Wrap urllib3 exceptions DecodeError and TimeoutError in corresponding requests exceptions

**Problem**: 
When using the requests library, users may encounter exceptions originating from the urllib3 library, such as `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`. These exceptions are not wrapped and raised as requests exceptions, causing users to handle urllib3-specific exceptions directly, which is inconsistent with the design goal of abstracting away lower-level exceptions.

**Analysis**:
The requests library acts as a higher-level HTTP client interface over urllib3, simplifying the exception handling process for users by wrapping urllib3 exceptions within its own exception hierarchy. By currently allowing `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` to propagate to the users, it causes inconsistency and raises maintenance issues since users need to be aware of and handle library-specific exceptions. 

The solution is to modify the requests library such that when these specific exceptions are raised by urllib3, they are caught and re-raised as appropriate exceptions from `requests.exceptions`.

**Proposed Changes**:
The focus will be on modifying the file `requests/exceptions.py`. We will add handling for the `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` exceptions, ensuring they are wrapped in the corresponding requests exceptions. 

1. Modify the __init__ and related handling sections to include the custom handling for `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError`.
2. Ensure `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` is mapped to `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.

Changes should be minimal and focused on achieving the wrapping logic without modifying the core functionality excessively.

**Changes to `requests/exceptions.py`:**
- **Modify `RequestException` class**:
  Include additional error handling to capture urllib3-specific exceptions `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.

- **Add Custom Initializations for New Exceptions**:
  Customize the `__init__` methods or the constructors to convert instances of `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` into `requests.exceptions.ContentDecodingError` and `requests.exceptions.Timeout`, respectively.

Detailed changes:
   
1. Within the `requests/exceptions.py` file, add catching mechanisms for `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`:
   - Verify existing imports and, if missing, import the necessary urllib3 exceptions at the top of the file:
     

2. Enhance relevant exception handling areas within the definition scope:
   - Ensure each `RequestException` derived class checks and wraps the corresponding urllib3 exceptions appropriately:
   - Update or override initializers for custom error types if needed.

3. Add handling logic within the `RequestException` class or higher-level catch scopes to specifically wrap and raise custom request exceptions:
   - Adjust the `RequestException` initializer:
     

By implementing these changes, we consolidate how exceptions are propagated from urllib3 through requests, ensuring users interact only with the requests' high-level exceptions. This minimizes confusion, aligns with the design principles, and simplifies error handling for library users.
