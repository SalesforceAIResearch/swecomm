urllib3 exceptions passing through requests API
I don't know if it's a design goal of requests to hide urllib3's exceptions and wrap them around requests.exceptions types.

(If it's not IMHO it should be, but that's another discussion)

If it is, I have at least two of them passing through that I have to catch in addition to requests' exceptions. They are requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError and requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError (this one I get when a proxy timeouts)

Thanks!
