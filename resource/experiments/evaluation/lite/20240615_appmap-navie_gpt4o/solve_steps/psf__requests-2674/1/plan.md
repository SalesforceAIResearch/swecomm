### Wrap `urllib3` Exceptions in `requests` Exceptions

#### Problem
`urllib3` exceptions `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` are passing through the `requests` API unwrapped. This requires users to catch exceptions from both `requests` and `urllib3`, potentially leading to complicated and error-prone exception handling logic.

#### Analysis
The `requests` library should ideally abstract away the underlying `urllib3` exceptions and present a unified set of exceptions to its callers. This means wrapping any exceptions that bubble up from `urllib3` within corresponding `requests` exceptions.

- **DecodeError**: This should be wrapped into `requests.exceptions.ContentDecodingError` as it deals with content-related decoding issues.
- **TimeoutError**: This should be wrapped into `requests.exceptions.Timeout`, which has subtypes already defined, such as `ConnectTimeout` and `ReadTimeout`.

#### Proposed Changes

1. **Modify Catch Blocks in `models.py`**: 
    - Add catch blocks for the specific `urllib3` exceptions in relevant sections of the code where requests are made and responses are processed.
    - Specifically, focus efforts where `ProtocolError`, `DecodeError`, and `ReadTimeoutError` are already being caught.

2. **Wrap Exceptions in `models.py`**:
    - Wrap `urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` in `requests.exceptions.ContentDecodingError`.
    - Wrap `urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` in `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.

Here are the changes to be implemented:

#### In `requests/models.py`

- Locate the sections of code that catch `urllib3` exceptions, including lines where `ProtocolError`, `DecodeError`, and `ReadTimeoutError` are already handled.
- Update these sections to include additional catch blocks for `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.

---

1. **Handling `DecodeError` within `requests/models.py:649-673`**
   - Modify the catch block in the `Response.iter_content` method.



- The `generate` function already catches `DecodeError` under `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions`.
- A new catch block can be added directly after other `urllib3` exceptions are handled.

2. **Handling `TimeoutError` within `requests/models.py:717-746`**

- Modify the `Response.content` property to properly handle the `urllib3` `TimeoutError`.


In this property, if a `TimeoutError` is raised by `urllib3`, it should be caught and wrapped in `requests.exceptions.Timeout`.

These changes should ensure that all `urllib3` exceptions are properly wrapped by corresponding `requests` exceptions, thereby maintaining a clean and consistent exception handling approach within the `requests` library.
