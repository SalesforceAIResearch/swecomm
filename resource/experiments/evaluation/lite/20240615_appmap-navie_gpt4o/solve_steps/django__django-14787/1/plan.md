**Title**: Modify `method_decorator` to Preserve Wrapper Assignments

**Problem**: 
The `method_decorator` function in the `django/utils/decorators.py` module fails to preserve wrapper assignments such as `__name__`, `__module__`, and others when a function is decorated. This results in an exception when these attributes are accessed. For instance, given a decorated function wrapped using `@method_decorator(logger)`, an `AttributeError` is raised because functools.partial objects lack attributes expected from functions.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause is that the `method_decorator` function does not correctly handle the assignment of standard function attributes (`__name__`, `__module__`, etc.) to the wrapper function. `functools.update_wrapper` or `functools.wraps` should be utilized to copy these attributes from the original function to the wrapping function, but this needs to be correctly applied within the context of `method_decorator`.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/utils/decorators.py`
   
   **Function**: `method_decorator(decorator, name='')`

   **Changes**:
   
   - After obtaining the `_wrapper` function by calling `_multi_decorate(decorator, method)`, ensure that `functools.update_wrapper` is applied to `_wrapper` to preserve the attributes of the original `method`.
   
   Detailed Changes:
   
   1. Import `functools` and specifically `update_wrapper`.

   2. Ensure that `update_wrapper` is applied to `_wrapper` with the original `method` as an argument. This will ensure that attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc., are properly preserved on the wrapper function.

Hereâ€™s a high-level overview of the change:


By implementing the above changes, `method_decorator` will correctly preserve the standard wrapper assignments when it decorates a method.

These changes focus on modifying a single file and a specific function within that file, ensuring minimal disruption to the codebase while addressing the reported issue effectively.
