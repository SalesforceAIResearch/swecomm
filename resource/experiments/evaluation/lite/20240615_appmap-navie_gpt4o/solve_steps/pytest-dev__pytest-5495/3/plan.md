**Title:** Improve Assertion Rewriting Message for Byte String Comparisons

**Problem:**
The current assertion rewriting messages for byte strings can be confusing, specifically the messages that refer to ASCII ordinal values for mismatch elements. For example:


results in:


The ASCII ordinal value of the first mismatched byte (`52`) is confusing. A similar confusion occurs in other cases where the ordinal value of the byte is printed, without an intuitive mapping to the actual byte character.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue is that the current implementation provides the ASCII ordinal value of the first byte difference which is not immediately intuitive to users who are comparing byte strings. The error messages could be more user-friendly by providing direct character comparisons and byte positions.

To resolve this, we can enhance the assertion explanation by adding clarity to the difference messages, specifically for byte strings, by showing byte values and positions directly rather than ASCII ordinal values.

**Proposed Changes:**
To address this issue, we need to make changes to the class responsible for rendering assertion error messages for easier readability. 

Changes are suggested for the `src/_pytest/reports.py` file:

1. **In the `_to_json` method:**
    - Modify the byte string comparison logic to include the byte-by-byte positional difference without referring to ASCII values.

2. **In the `CollectErrorRepr` or `TestReport` class:**
    - Update the logic that formats the assertion error message for byte strings to make the output more intuitive.

Focus specifically on the logic that constructs the difference messages for `longrepr` when handling byte strings.

### Detailed Change Plan:

1. **Enhance Byte String Diff Representation:**
    - Locate the functionality where assertion messages are being created, particularly focusing on areas around `reprcrash` and `reprtraceback` for the `longrepr` attribute in `TestReport`.
    - Implement a custom byte comparison explanation that outputs byte differences in a more human-readable format (e.g., showing the actual bytes and their positions instead of ASCII ordinals).

**File to be modified:**
- `src/_pytest/reports.py`

**Specific changes to be made:**

1. **Modify `_to_json` method to handle byte string assertion differences more clearly:**
    - Identify and customize the comparison and diff logic for byte string types.



By focusing on this section, the error messaging around byte string comparisons will become clearer and more helpful for users encountering assertion errors. This enhancement will improve readability and understanding of assertion failure contexts involving byte strings.
