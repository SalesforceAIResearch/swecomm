**Title:** Improve Assertion Error Messages for Byte String Comparisons

**Problem:**

The assertion rewriting for byte string comparisons can produce confusing messages, specifically showing ASCII ordinal values for the differing bytes without adequate context for interpreting these values. This makes it difficult for users to understand why the assertion failed.

**Analysis:**

The current system provides a diff for byte strings that includes ASCII ordinal values. While technically accurate, this representation can be confusing for users who might not immediately recognize the ASCII values corresponding to characters. When comparing `b''` to `b'42'`, the output showing `52` as the differing byte does not immediately clarify that `52` is the ASCII value for the character `'4'`.

To improve this, the assertion error message should be enhanced to display both the ASCII ordinal values and their corresponding character representations. This would make it clearer to users where the assertion failed and why. 

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: `src/_pytest/reports.py`**

   - Update the section responsible for formatting assertion failure messages to enhance byte string comparison outputs.

   - Modify the existing functions that handle assertion error message generation to include both the ordinal value and the character representation when displaying differences in byte strings.

   - Focus on areas where `longrepr` is constructed and diff outputs are formatted.

   **Suggested Modifications:**

   1. Locate the function responsible for generating the diff output for assertion failures. This function likely uses `difflib` or similar tools to generate a side-by-side diff.
   2. Enhance the output formatting to include both the ordinal values and their corresponding character representations for byte string differences. This might require custom logic for detecting when the compared objects are byte strings and applying the additional formatting.
   3. Ensure that the enhanced messages are clear and include both parts of the information: the raw ordinal value and its character equivalent.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of logical sections that might need changes within `src/_pytest/reports.py`:

- **Functions to Modify:**
  - `def pytest_assertrepr_compare(op, left, right):`
    - This function is likely involved in generating the custom assertion messages and could be the right place to enhance byte string diffing.
  - `def compare_byte_strings(left, right, verbose=False):`
    - Adding this helper function within the context of the file if not already present to manage bytestring-specific comparison logic.

- **Steps to Modify Code:**
  1. In `pytest_assertrepr_compare`, add conditions to check if `left` and `right` are byte strings.
  2. Within the condition, call `compare_byte_strings(left, right)` to get a detailed, user-friendly comparison.
  3. In `compare_byte_strings`:
     - Use difflib to get the differences.
     - Add customized lines to show ASCII ordinal values and corresponding characters in the diff output.

This change should make assertion error messages for byte strings more intuitive by providing better context around ASCII values in diffs. This approach should minimize disruption to other types of assertion error messages while directly tackling the confusion reported by users.
