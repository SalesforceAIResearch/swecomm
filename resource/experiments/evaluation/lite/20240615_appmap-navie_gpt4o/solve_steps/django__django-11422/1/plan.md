**Title**: Fix Autoreloader with StatReloader to Track Changes in manage.py

**Problem**
The issue lies with the Django autoreloader when using `StatReloader`. After upgrading to Django 2.2.1, changes made to `manage.py` are not being tracked, meaning the auto-reloading mechanism isn't triggered when `manage.py` is modified. This previously worked in Django 2.1.8 and prior versions.

**Analysis**
The autoreloading feature is responsible for restarting the server when changes in the codebase are detected. The `StatReloader` specifically uses file modification timestamps to detect changes. It seems that in the upgrade to Django 2.2.1, the `StatReloader` may not be configured to monitor the `manage.py` file for changes anymore.

Possible cause:
- There may be changes in how `StatReloader` collects the files to monitor, which might exclude `manage.py` now.
- The `manage.py` file might not be included in the set of files that the `StatReloader` is explicitly watching.

To solve this, we need to ensure that `manage.py` is explicitly tracked by the `StatReloader`.

**Proposed Changes**
In the context of the problem, the relevant file that handles the autoreloading mechanism is likely the Django management command for running the server, which is `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`. We will make modifications there to ensure `manage.py` is monitored by the `StatReloader`.

1. **django/core/management/commands/runserver.py**:
    - Ensure `manage.py` file is explicitly added to the files being tracked by the `StatReloader`.
    - Modify or extend the logic where the reloader watches files to include the root `manage.py`.

    Change Suggestions:
    - Locate the section of code where the `StatReloader` is initialized and add logic to include the `manage.py` file.
    - Ensure that the tracking covers the location and naming convention of the `manage.py` file.

By implementing this change, the `StatReloader` will monitor the `manage.py` file again, and modifications to it will correctly trigger the auto-reloader as expected.
