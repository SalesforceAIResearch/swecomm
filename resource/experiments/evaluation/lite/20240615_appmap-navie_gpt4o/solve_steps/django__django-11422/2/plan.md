**Title**: Fix autoreloader to track changes in manage.py with StatReloader

**Problem**:
The autoreloader, specifically the StatReloader, does not track changes made to the `manage.py` script when running a development server via `python manage.py runserver`. As a result, modifications to `manage.py` do not trigger the auto-reloading mechanism in Django version 2.2.1, although this works correctly in version 2.1.8 and prior versions.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem seems to be that `django.utils.autoreload` does not include the `manage.py` file in the set of monitored files when using the StatReloader. Thus, changes made to `manage.py` are not detected, and the server does not restart automatically.

A potential reason for this behavior could be due to how the list of files to be monitored is generated or how the reloader identifies the relevant files associated with the Django project. To resolve this, the `manage.py` file needs to be explicitly included in the list of files being tracked by the autoreload mechanism.

**Proposed Changes**:
The primary focus should be on ensuring that the `manage.py` script is included in the files monitored by the StatReloader. The necessary changes can be made in the `django/utils/autoreload.py` file, specifically in the section where the list of files to be watched is determined.

Here are the detailed modifications suggested to fix the issue:

1. **Update `django/utils/autoreload.py`:**
    - Modify the logic in this file to explicitly include `manage.py` as one of the files that the autoreloader should watch.

### Suggested Changes:

- Locate the section of code where the files to be watched are identified.
- Ensure that `manage.py` is explicitly added to the list of files to be monitored by the StatReloader.
- Ensure that `manage.py` path resolution works correctly, so it identifies the correct path relative to where the server is run.

For example, if there is a function that collects file paths, modify it to include `manage.py`.

By implementing these changes, the autoreloader will correctly detect changes made to the `manage.py` script, thereby triggering the automatic reloading mechanism as expected.
