**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Solve the problem as if you... (2655)
1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**

focused ond describing the problem fully as a software Issue, aka Ticket.


The problem statement will be prefixed with "[problem-statement]"
2ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

Focus the plan on modifying exactly one file.

Do not modify test case files. Test case files are those that include "test", "tests" in their paths,

Autoreloader with StatReloader doesn't track changes in manage.py.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
This is a bit convoluted, but here we go.
Environment (OSX 10.11):
$ python -V
Python 3.6.2
$ pip -V
pip 19.1.1
$ pip install Django==2.2.1
Steps to reproduce:
Run a server python manage.py runserver
Edit the manage.py file, e.g. add print(): 
def main():
	print('sth')
	os.environ.setdefault('DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE', 'ticket_30479.settings')
	...
Under 2.1.8 (and prior), this will trigger the auto-reloading mechanism. Under 2.2.1, it won't. As far as I can tell from the django.utils.autoreload log lines, it never sees the manage.py itself.
