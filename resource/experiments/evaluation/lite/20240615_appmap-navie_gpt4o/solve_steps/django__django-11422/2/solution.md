To ensure the `manage.py` script is included in the files monitored by the autoreloader, we will modify the `django/utils/autoreload.py` file. We will explicitly add the `manage.py` file to the list of watched files in the `StatReloader` class.

Below are the changes to address the issue.

The above change will include `manage.py` as part of the files monitored by the autoreloader. By adding this file explicitly to the monitored files, we ensure that any changes made to `manage.py` will be detected, and the server will restart automatically as expected.
