**Title**: Fix Column Insertion Logic in SparseMatrix.col_insert()

**Problem**: The `col_insert()` method of the `SparseMatrix` class does not correctly insert columns into the matrix, leading to an erroneous output where subsequent matrix elements are shifted incorrectly.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue is that the `col_insert()` method is not properly adjusting the column indices when inserting the new columns. This causes the original columns to be displaced inappropriately within the resulting matrix.

The `col_insert()` method should carefully reindex the columns such that:
1. Columns to the right of the insertion point are correctly shifted.
2. The new columns are inserted in the correct positions without disturbing the order of original columns unnecessarily.

**Proposed Changes**: The changes should be made within the `sparse.py` file, specifically in the `SparseMatrix` class where the `col_insert()` method is defined. The steps to fix this issue are as follows:

1. **Modify the Column Index Adjustment**:
   - Adjust logic within the `col_insert()` method to reindex the existing columns correctly when a new column is inserted.

2. **Ensure Correct Insertion of New Columns**:
   - Ensure that the range of columns being inserted is correctly accounted for, and inserted starting at the specified index without overlapping incorrectly with the existing columns.

### sympy/matrices/sparse.py

**File: sympy/matrices/sparse.py**

1. **In `SparseMatrix` Class**:
   - Locate the `col_insert` method.
   - Adjust the logic to correctly handle column insertion, taking care to shift columns as necessary and insert new columns in the correct positions.



**Summary**: The proposed changes will adjust the `col_insert` method logic to correctly reindex and insert columns in a `SparseMatrix`. This will prevent the erroneous shifting of subsequent matrix elements and ensure proper insertion of new columns as demonstrated in the provided example.
