**Title**: Fix Matrix.col_insert() Logic to Correctly Insert Columns 

**Problem**: The `Matrix.col_insert()` method is not functioning correctly. When inserting new columns into a matrix at a specified index, the resulting matrix has shifted elements, causing alignment issues.

**Analysis**: The issue lies within the `col_insert` method of the `Matrix` class. When inserting columns, the internal method likely inserts the new columns but fails to correctly shift and adjust the elements after the insertion point, causing misalignment in the resulting matrix.

**Causes**:
1. Incorrect handling of the insertion point, resulting in matrix values being incorrectly shifted.
2. Elements that should be moved beyond the inserted columns are not correctly repositioned.
3. The new columns might be placed in the wrong position, displacing existing elements incorrectly.

**Effects**:
- Elements of the matrix after the inserted position are incorrectly repositioned.
- Misalignment of matrix rows and columns occurs, leading to incorrect representation of the matrix.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **sympy/matrices/sparse.py**:
    - **Method**: `_eval_col_insert`.
    - **Changes**:
        - Adjust the logic for shifting existing columns after the inserted columns.
        - Ensure that new columns are inserted at the correct index without displacing existing elements incorrectly.
        - Thoroughly test if the matrix elements are correctly repositioned post-insertion.

    **Detailed Steps**:
    - Ensure the loop correctly identifies the position where new columns should be inserted.
    - Adjust the positions of elements after the insertion point to accommodate the new columns.
    - Revalidate the placement of elements to avoid misalignment issues.

By modifying the `_eval_col_insert` method in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`, we can ensure that the `col_insert` method correctly handles the insertion of new columns while preserving the rest of the matrix structure correctly. 

**File**: sympy/matrices/sparse.py
- Locate the `_eval_col_insert` method.
- Modify the logic for shifting and inserting elements to ensure correct column insertion behavior.

With these changes, the `Matrix.col_insert()` function should work as expected, correctly inserting columns at the specified index without misaligning existing matrix elements.
