**Title**: Fix Matrix.col_insert() to correctly insert columns at specified index

**Problem**: 
The `Matrix.col_insert()` function in SymPy incorrectly shifts entries of the appended matrix (identity matrix in the given example) when inserting new columns from another matrix. The new columns appear at the specified location, but the original matrix elements are incorrectly shifted or misplaced.

**Analysis**:
The `col_insert()` method should insert columns from one matrix into another matrix at the specified column index. The expected behavior is that the structure and values of the original matrix should remain intact with the inserted columns in the correct locations.

In the provided code selection, the likely cause is located in the implementation of the `_eval_col_insert()` method in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`. This method handles the logic for column insertion but seems to alter matrix structure and values incorrectly when integrating the new columns. Specifically, the issue might be within the loop that creates space for new columns and adds the new columns.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `_eval_col_insert()` method in `sympy/matrices/sparse.py` to correct the logic for column insertion so that inserted columns do not disrupt the original matrix structure and values. Ensure that the columns from the original matrix and the columns being inserted are combined correctly without shifting misplaced rows or columns.

The following steps should be taken to rectify the issue:

1. **Update `_eval_col_insert` Method**:
   - Ensure that the loop correctly makes room for the new columns without altering the existing matrix structure.
   - Properly handle the new columns' insertion at the specified index.

File: `sympy/matrices/sparse.py`
   
- **Modify the initial loop to make room:**
  - Fix the logic to correctly increment the column indices of the original matrix beyond the insertion index.

- **Modify the loop adding new columns:**
  - Ensure the new columns are inserted at the specified index without disrupting existing columns.

The logic should be updated to handle the index adjustments correctly.

2. **Test the Change**:
   - After modifying the method, run the existing test cases to ensure the fix does not break current functionality.
   - Create extensive tests to cover edge cases for column insertion, including different matrix sizes and insertion indices.

Implementing these changes should resolve the issues associated with the `Matrix.col_insert()` method and preserve the matrix's integrity while inserting new columns.
