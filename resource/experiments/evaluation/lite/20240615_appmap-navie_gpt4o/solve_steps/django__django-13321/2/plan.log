**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

Decoding an invalid session data crashes.
Description
	 
		(last modified by Matt Hegarty)
	 
Hi
I recently upgraded my staging server to 3.1. I think that there was an old session which was still active.
On browsing to any URL, I get the crash below. It looks similar to â€‹this issue.
I cannot login at all with Chrome - each attempt to access the site results in a crash. Login with Firefox works fine.
This is only happening on my Staging site, which is running Gunicorn behind nginx proxy.
Internal Server Error: /overview/
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "/usr/local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py", line 215, in _get_session
return self._session_cache
