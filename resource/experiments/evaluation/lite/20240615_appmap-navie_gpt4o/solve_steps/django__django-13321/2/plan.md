### Title:
Handle invalid session data gracefully during decoding

### Problem:
A `BadSignature` error during session decoding in Django 3.1 causes a crash when the session contains invalid data. This issue prevents users from logging in when the session data is corrupted, affecting Chrome users on a staging site running Gunicorn behind an nginx proxy.

### Analysis:
The issue occurs when the session data contains an invalid signature or is improperly encoded. The stack trace indicates that the `decode` method encounters a `BadSignature` exception when decoding the session data.

To handle this gracefully, the `decode` method should fall back to an appropriate fallback, such as an empty session, if the session data is invalid. The `binascii.Error` also needs to be caught and handled to avoid crashes due to incorrect padding during base64 decoding.

### Proposed Changes:
1. **File:** `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`
   - **Method: `decode(self, session_data)`**
     - Modify the `decode` method to catch `BadSignature` and `binascii.Error` exceptions.
     - If these exceptions are raised, return an empty session dictionary instead of allowing the crash to propagate.

2. **Details:**
   - Surround the existing `decode` logic with a try-except block to catch `BadSignature` exceptions and fallback to an appropriate action.
   - Ensure the `decode` method also catches and handles `binascii.Error` to prevent crashes due to invalid base64 encoding.

### Specific Changes:
- Modify the `decode` method at `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py:119-131` to include additional exception handling:

  

- Suggested code for handling `BadSignature` and `binascii.Error`:
    
  

By implementing these changes, the `decode` method will handle invalid session data more gracefully, preventing crashes and improving the robustness of the session handling in Django.
