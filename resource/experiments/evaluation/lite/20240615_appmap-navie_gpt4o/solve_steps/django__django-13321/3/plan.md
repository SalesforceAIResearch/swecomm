**Title: Add Proper Exception Handling for Invalid Session Data in SessionStore Methods**

**Problem:**
When decoding an invalid session data, the application crashes. This issue occurs when the session data signature does not match, causing a BadSignature exception, followed by other cascading exceptions. This makes the user unable to log in, especially noted in the context of upgrading to Django 3.1 and observing these issues in specific environments like a staging site with Gunicorn behind an nginx proxy.

**Analysis:**
The problem arises from the insufficient exception handling in the `decode` method in `SessionBase` class in `base.py`. Currently, if the session data's signature does not match, a `BadSignature` exception is raised by the `signing.loads` method, which is not handled gracefully, leading to further issues. This uncaught exception eventually leads to chain reactions causing crashes in subsequent function calls.

To resolve this, the `decode` method should handle `BadSignature` and similar exceptions robustly, returning an empty dictionary or some form of error message instead of letting the exception propagate and crash the application. Proper logging is also essential to ensure that these types of errors can be monitored.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: `django/contrib/sessions/backends/base.py`**

   **Function: `decode(self, session_data)`**
   - Modify this function to catch more specific exceptions like `BadSignature`, `binascii.Error`, etc.
   - Return an empty dictionary or a default fallback value if decoding fails.
   - Add logging to track occurrences of invalid session data.

2. **Change Descriptions:**
   - In the `decode` function, update the `except` block to handle `django.core.signing.BadSignature` and `binascii.Error` separately.
   - Ensure that any uncaught exceptions do not propagate and crash the application.
   - Log a warning message whenever such an exception is caught to facilitate debugging and monitoring.

   **Example Change:**
   - Within the `decode` method, the relevant exception handling block will be updated as follows:
     - Replace the generic `except Exception:` to handle specific exceptions.
     - Add logging for caught exceptions.

By updating the `decode` function in `SessionBase` and ensuring that invalid session data is handled correctly, we will prevent the application from crashing and provide a more robust user experience. This also makes it easier to identify and fix issues related to session data in the future.
