**Title**: Fix warning models.W042 by configuring DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD explicitly

**Problem**: The Django 3.2 alpha introduced a warning (models.W042) when primary keys are not explicitly defined in models, defaulting to `AutoField`. This affects inherited models where primary keys are defined in the ancestor models. Your project doesn't explicitly configure a default auto field type, which leads to autogenerated primary keys, generating a warning.

**Analysis**: The root cause is that Django 3.2 now expects users to explicitly configure the type of auto-created primary keys if they do not define one in their model. Without explicit configuration, it defaults to using `AutoField`, and thus it raises the warning models.W042. Previously, in Django 3.1, this configuration was implicit.

The optimal place to address this is within the application configuration class (`AppConfig`). We need to set the `default_auto_field` attribute to a subclass of `AutoField`, such as `BigAutoField`, within each respective config class responsible for the applications mentioned in the warning.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/apps/config.py`
   - **Function/Method**: `AppConfig`
   - **Modification**: Add or modify the `default_auto_field` attribute to use `django.db.models.BigAutoField` or any other preferred subclass of `AutoField`.
   
   First, identify the application configuration classes in your `apps.py` of each affected application (like `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`, `SpeedyCoreContactByFormConfig`, `SpeedyCoreMessagesConfig`, etc.), and set the `default_auto_field` attribute.

    - For `SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig`, modify/add:
      

    - For `SpeedyCoreContactByFormConfig`, modify/add:
      

    - Repeat similar changes for other configurations, such as `SpeedyCoreMessagesConfig`, `AppConfig` for friendship models, and so on.

These changes ensure that Django knows the preferred type of auto-created primary keys for models within these applications and will suppress the warnings.

Make sure to run `makemigrations` and `migrate` again after these changes to apply any necessary database updates.

Note: If a global default is preferred and applicable, set `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in the `settings.py` as an alternative approach:
 

However, the first approach ensures more granular control over specific applications.
