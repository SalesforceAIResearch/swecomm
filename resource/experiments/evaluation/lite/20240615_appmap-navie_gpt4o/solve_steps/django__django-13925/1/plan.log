models.W042 is raised on inherited manually specified primary key.
Description
	
I have models which inherit from other models, and they should inherit the primary key. This works fine with Django 3.1. However, if I install Django 3.2 alpha, when I run make_migrations I get the following error messages:

WARNINGS:
accounts.ReservedUsername: (models.W042) Auto-created primary key used when not defining a primary key type, by default 'django.db.models.AutoField'.
		HINT: Configure the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting or the SpeedyCoreAccountsConfig.default_auto_field attribute to point to a subclass of AutoField, e.g. 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'.
