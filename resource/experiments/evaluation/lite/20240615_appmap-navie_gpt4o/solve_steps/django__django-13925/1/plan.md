**Title**: Fix Model Inheritance Warning by Setting Explicit Primary Key Type

**Problem**:
Django 3.2 introduces a default primary key type, which raises a warning (models.W042) when models do not explicitly specify a primary key type, resulting in the use of an auto-created primary key. This issue occurs even in models that inherit a primary key from a parent class. The warnings suggest configuring `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` or the `AppConfig.default_auto_field` attribute to specify a subclass of `AutoField`, such as `BigAutoField`.

**Analysis**:
The warnings arise because Django 3.2 enforces stricter checks, prompting users to explicitly define the primary key type to avoid unintentional use of auto-created primary keys. This behavior ensures that there is no ambiguity about the primary key type used in the application.

To resolve this issue and suppress the warnings, you need to explicitly set the `default_auto_field` attribute in your application's configuration. This is a project-wide setting that can be applied either globally by setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in your `settings.py` or more granularly by setting `default_auto_field` in the application configuration class (`AppConfig`).

**Proposed Changes**:
The best single-file change to resolve this issue involves modifying the `AppConfig` class in the Django application configuration file. The Django `AppConfig` class needs to be updated to specify the `default_auto_field` attribute.

1. **File**: `django/apps/config.py`
   - **Function**: `__init__`
   - Add a `self.default_auto_field` attribute if it is not already specified in the application configuration.

Here are the detailed changes:

1. **Modifying `AppConfig` Class (django/apps/config.py)**:
   - Update the `AppConfig` class's `__init__` method to set the `default_auto_field` attribute if not already set.
   - This ensures that the `default_auto_field` attribute is defined, suppressing the warnings about auto-created primary keys.

Specific modification:
- Check if `default_auto_field` is not set and set it to a subclass of `AutoField`, for instance, `BigAutoField`.

python
   from django.db.models import BigAutoField

2. Modify the `AppConfig` class's `__init__` method:
   

After making these changes, all models within the application will inherit the `default_auto_field` setting from the application configuration, thereby resolving the warnings about auto-created primary keys.

This change ensures the explicit specification of a primary key type, fulfilling the new requirements introduced by Django 3.2 and eliminating the (models.W042) warnings.
