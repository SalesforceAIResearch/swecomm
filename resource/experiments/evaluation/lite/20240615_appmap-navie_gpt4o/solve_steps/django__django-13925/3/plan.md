**Title**: Update Django to Properly Handle Inherited Manually Defined Primary Keys on Model Inheritance

**Problem**: 
In Django 3.2 alpha, a warning (models.W042) is raised for models inheriting manually specified primary keys from ancestor models. This occurs despite the primary key being correctly defined in the ancestor model, resulting in unexpected warnings about auto-created primary keys.

**Analysis**:

1. **Root Cause**: 
   - In Django 3.2 alpha, the system check generates a models.W042 warning when an inherited primary key in a child model isn’t explicitly declared. This change likely originated from the new DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting introduced to simplify migrations by making `BigAutoField` the default primary key type. However, in the presence of inherited primary keys, this behavior incorrectly treats the absence of an explicit primary key in the child class as a missing primary key, leading to the warning.

1. **Intent**: 
   - Ensure that inherited primary keys from ancestor models are recognized and prevent the models.W042 warning from being erroneously raised.

1. **Effect**: 
   - The current behavior disrupts projects upgrading from Django 3.1 to 3.2 by generating warnings about auto-created primary keys where none should exist. This not only causes noise but could lead to unnecessary confusion and erroneous handling of database migrations.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/db/models/options.py`

   **Function**: `_prepare`

   **Changes**:
   - Modify the `_prepare` function within the `Options` class to ensure inherited fields (especially primary keys) are recognized correctly.
   - Implement logic to check for inherited primary keys in base classes before raising models.W042 warning. 
   - Ensure the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting does not enforce an incorrect warning when a primary key is inherited but not redefined explicitly in the child class.

1. **Details**:
   - Analyze the method handling field collection (`collect_fields`) and modify it to recognize inherited primary keys.
   - Adjust the logic in `_prepare` to conditionally bypass the models.W042 warning when an inherited primary key is present.

This modification will ensure the inherited primary keys are correctly identified, and the models.W042 warnings will not trigger incorrectly, restoring the expected behavior from Django 3.1 while maintaining compatibility with Django 3.2’s new settings.

By addressing this issue strictly in the context of class options preparation, this isolated change minimizes the risk of broader impacts on other parts of the framework.
