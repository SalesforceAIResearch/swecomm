**Title**: Allow returning IDs in bulk_create with update_conflicts

**Problem**:
`bulk_create` in Django's QuerySet does not return primary keys when updating conflicts with `update_conflicts=True`. This limits the feature's usability for scenarios where bulk upsert functionality is desired.

**Analysis**:

1. **Root Cause**: 
   When `bulk_create` is invoked with `update_conflicts=True`, Django does not include the `RETURNING` clause in the SQL query. This omission prevents IDs from being returned in the resulting queryset, and the root cause traces back to the point where the `returning_fields` are intentionally removed in the query preparation phase.

2. **Desired Functionality**:
   In the context of conflict handling via updates (not ignoring conflicts), the IDs of the updated or newly created entries should be returned. PostgreSQL allows this by adding the `RETURNING` clause to the end of the `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` query.

3. **Affected Method**:
   The core method encapsulating this functionality is `bulk_create`, but the modifications are likely needed in the query-building logic specifically around handling the `update_conflicts` scenario.

**Proposed Changes**:

File: `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py`

1. **Modify the `InsertQuery` Class**:
   - Update the `InsertQuery` class to conditionally include the `RETURNING` clause when `update_conflicts` is set.
   - Ensure that the `returning_fields` are preserved if `update_conflicts=True`.

Step-by-step:
   
   - **Update `__init__` Method**: Ensure the initializer captures returning fields conditionally.
   - **Modify Query Construction**: Update the method responsible for constructing the `INSERT` command to append `RETURNING` clause conditionally.

2. **Specific Changes**:

   - **`__init__` Method**:
     - Ensure that it takes into account `returning_fields` if `update_conflicts=True`.

   - **`insert_values` Method**:
     - Modify the method to retain `returning_fields` when conflicts are set to update.

   - **Add Required Logic**:
     - Introduce a check point where `returning_fields` are only excluded if `ignore_conflicts=True` but kept if `update_conflicts=True`.

3. **Example Logic Changes**:
   - Add checks to see if `self.on_conflict` and `self.update_conflicts` are set.
   - Modify the SQL string construction process to append `RETURNING` clause if the conditions meet.

**Summary**:
Return IDs in `bulk_create` when `update_conflicts=True` by ensuring the `RETURNING` clause is included in the SQL query. This involves modifying the `InsertQuery` class methods to preserve the `returning_fields` conditionally based on the conflict strategy rationale.
