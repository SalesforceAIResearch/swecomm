**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

[Bug]: using clf and pyplot.draw in range slider on_changed callback blocks input to widgets
### Bug summary

When using clear figure, adding new widgets and then redrawing the current figure in the on_changed callback of a range slider the inputs to all the widgets in the figure are blocked. When doing the same in the button callback on_clicked, everything works fine.

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as pyplot
import matplotlib.widgets as widgets

def onchanged(values):
    print("on changed")
    print(values)
    pyplot.clf()
    addElements()
    pyplot.draw()

def onclick(e):
    print("on click")
    pyplot.clf()
    addElements()
    pyplot.draw()

def addElements():
    ax = pyplot.axes([0.1, 0.45, 0.8, 0.1])
    global slider
