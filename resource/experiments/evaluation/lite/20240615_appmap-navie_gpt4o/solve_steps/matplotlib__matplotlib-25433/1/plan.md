**Title**: Resolve widget input blockage when using `pyplot.clf` and `pyplot.draw` in RangeSlider's `on_changed` callback

**Problem**: 
When using `pyplot.clf()` followed by `pyplot.draw()` within the `on_changed` callback of a `RangeSlider`, the inputs to all widgets in the figure are blocked, rendering them unresponsive. This issue does not occur when the same operations are performed in the `on_clicked` callback of a `Button`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is related to how `pyplot.clf()` (clear current figure) and `pyplot.draw()` affect the event handling within the `RangeSlider`'s `on_changed` callback. Clearing the figure and immediately redrawing it inside the `on_changed` callback disrupts the internal state and event connections that are crucial for widget interaction. This interference affects the event loop, causing widgets to become unresponsive.

Understanding that `on_changed` is a continuously firing event while the slider is being manipulated as opposed to `on_clicked` which fires once, makes the issue prominent. Continuous clearing and redrawing in a high-frequency callback like `on_changed` exhausts event handling, causing input blockage.

**Proposed Changes**:
We'll modify the callback to schedule the figure clearing and redrawing logic after a slight delay, ensuring that events related to widget interactions are processed timely before updating the figure. We achieve this by using a timer-based approach, ensuring minimal disruption in the event loop.

### File: `galleries/examples/widgets/range_slider.py`

1. **Locate the `update` function within the `RangeSlider` example**:
   - Add a delay to `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` when invoked in `on_changed`.

2. **Modify the `update` function**:
   - Instead of directly calling `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` inside `update`, use a timer to delay these calls slightly.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Import `threading` module** to enable delay in function execution using a timer.

2. **Update the `update` function** to use a timer:
    - Replace direct calls to `pyplot.clf()` and `pyplot.draw()` with a call to a new function (`delayed_update`) that handles these after a short delay.

3. **Define the `delayed_update` function**:
    - This function will contain the logic to clear the figure and redraw it.

4. **Update callback registration**:
    - Ensure the `on_changed` callback triggers `delayed_update` instead of directly clearing and redrawing.

Here is the revised `RangeSlider` example file plan:

### range_slider.py

1. **Import threading**:
   - `import threading`

2. **Define delayed_update**:
   - Inside this function, place the logic for `pyplot.clf()`, `addElements()`, and `pyplot.draw()`.

3. **Update the `update` function**:
   - Modify `update` to not directly clear and redraw, but to set a timer to call `delayed_update`.

**Changes in range_slider.py**:

1. `update` function:
    - Modify the `update` function to the following:



### Full Pipeline:
1. **Timer Import**:
   - Ensure `import threading` is at the beginning of the file.

2. **Update the `update` function**:
   - Modify it as shown above to use `threading.Timer`.

This updated logic will schedule the figure clearing and redrawing to occur just after the current processing allowing the `on_changed` callback to complete without blocking user interactions with the widgets.
