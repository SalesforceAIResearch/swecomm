**Title**: Update PostScript backend to handle NoneType text stream in draw_text method

**Problem**:
The PostScript backend in Matplotlib raises a `TypeError` when attempting to save a figure that contains a multi-line text label with an empty line. The issue arises due to the handling of text streams where an empty line results in a `NoneType` object being processed, which cannot be unpacked.

**Analysis**:
The bug occurs within the `draw_text` method of the PostScript backend (`backend_ps.py`). When the text stream contains an empty line, it returns `None`, leading to the `TypeError` when the method attempts to unpack it.

To resolve this, we need to validate the text stream before unpacking it. If the stream is `None`, we should skip processing that line to avoid the error.

**Proposed Changes**:
The modifications should be made in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py` to ensure the `draw_text` method handles `NoneType` streams gracefully.

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py`
   - **Location**: Around line 669 (inside the `draw_text` method)
   - **Change Description**: 
     - Before unpacking the stream, add a check to ensure the stream is not `None`.
     - If the stream is `None`, skip to the next iteration.

   **Steps for modification**:
   - Locate the `draw_text` method.
   - Within the loop that processes the text stream, add a conditional check to verify that the stream is not `None` before unpacking.

   Detailed changes:
   - In the `draw_text` method, find the line:
     
   - Modify the code to include a check before this line:
     
   - Ensure similar checks are applied to any relevant locations within the method where streams might be processed.

By implementing this change, the `draw_text` method will be robust against `NoneType` streams, preventing the `TypeError` and allowing figures with empty lines in text labels to be saved without issue.
