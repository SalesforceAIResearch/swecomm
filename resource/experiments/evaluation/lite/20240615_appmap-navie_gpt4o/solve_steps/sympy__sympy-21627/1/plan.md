**Title**: Fix RecursionError in `is_zero` check for `cosh` expression

**Problem**: The code snippet `sympify("cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))").is_zero` triggers a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object`. This issue occurs when attempting to determine if a complex nested function expression involving `cosh` is zero. The recursive nature of function calls leads to excessive depth, causing the recursion limit to be exceeded.

**Analysis**: The problem seems rooted in the recursive evaluation of both trigonometric (`cosh`, `acos`) and hyperbolic (`acosh`) functions within the expression. The current implementation does not adequately handle deeply nested function calls, causing repeated evaluations without reaching a base case or termination condition.

To resolve the issue, we need to modify the recursive handling within the `HyperRep` classes, particularly ensuring that deeply nested functions are evaluated without causing recursion depth errors. This involves implementing a more robust mechanism to determine the zero state, possibly involving caching or iterative methods instead of purely recursive calls.

**Proposed Changes**: The file `sympy/functions/special/hyper.py` should be modified to handle deeply nested function evaluations in a non-recursive way. Here's the suggested modification:

1. **Modify `HyperRep_cosasin` Class**:
   - Update the methods `_expr_small`, `_expr_small_minus`, `_expr_big`, and `_expr_big_minus` to include non-recursive evaluation mechanisms and safeguard against recursion limits.



2. **Adjust Recursive Calls**:
   - Ensure internal methods questioning zero-equivalence (`is_zero`) handle expressions with large depth iteratively.



By making these adjustments, we should be able to prevent the `RecursionError` while still correctly determining the zero equivalence of complex nested expressions involving functions like `cosh`, `acos`, and `acosh`.
