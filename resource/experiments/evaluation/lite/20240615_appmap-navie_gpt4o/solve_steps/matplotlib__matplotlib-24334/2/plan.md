**Title: Validate kwargs in Axes.set_xticks/Axis.set_ticks even if ticklabels are not set**

**Problem**
Currently, the `Axis.set_ticks` method does not validate the keyword arguments (`kwargs`) unless `labels` are passed. This can lead to silent failures when invalid or incorrect keyword arguments like `xticklabels` are passed without `labels`. This behavior can cause confusion and debugging difficulties for users, as the incorrect `kwargs` will simply be ignored without any warning or error.

**Analysis**
To address this issue, we need to update the `set_ticks` method to validate `kwargs` as `Text` properties, even when `labels` are not explicitly provided. This validation should ensure that only valid `Text` properties are accepted as `kwargs`, and potentially raise an error if `labels` is not provided but `kwargs` are.

The logic changes necessary to resolve this issue include:
1. Modify the `set_ticks` method to process `kwargs` validation independently of the presence of `labels`.
2. Introduce a validation mechanism that checks whether each `kwarg` is a valid `Text` property.
3. Optionally, consider raising an error when `kwargs` are provided without corresponding `labels`.

**Proposed Changes**
The file to focus on for this change is `lib/matplotlib/axis.py`. The change should be implemented in the `set_ticks` method of the `Axis` class.

1. **Update `Axis.set_ticks` method**:
    - **Location**: `lib/matplotlib/axis.py`
    - **Function**: `Axis.set_ticks`
    - **Changes**:
        - Add a validation step for `kwargs` to ensure they are valid `Text` properties.
        - If any invalid properties are found, raise a `ValueError` with a descriptive message indicating the issue.
        - Determine if `kwargs` should be an error when `labels` are not set, or if a warning should suffice.

Notes:
- It is important to reuse existing validation utilities within Matplotlib if available.
- Ensure backward compatibility where possible, but prioritize user transparency and correctness.
- Consider documenting this change clearly to inform users about the new validation behavior.

By implementing these changes, we will prevent silent failures and improve the robustness and user experience of the `set_ticks` method.
