**Title**: Validate kwargs in `Axis.set_ticks` even if `labels` are not set

**Problem**: 

Currently, `Axis.set_ticks` only validates kwargs if the `labels` parameter is provided. If kwargs are passed without `labels`, they are silently ignored, leading to a scenario where invalid kwargs are not detected or reported. This can lead to confusion and bugs as developers may assume their kwargs are applied, but they are not.

**Analysis**:

To enhance the functionality of `Axis.set_ticks`, it is essential to validate any kwargs passed to the method, even if `labels` are not provided. This can be achieved by first verifying if kwargs are valid properties of matplotlib's `.Text` object. Furthermore, an additional check can ensure that any kwargs without accompanying `labels` raise an error, thus enforcing proper usage.

This can be accomplished by enforcing validation of the kwargs in the `set_ticks` method inside `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`. The validation process can be done by leveraging the `_process_text_args` method which is used for validating text properties in Matplotlib.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Validate kwargs even if `labels` are not set**:
   
   - **File**: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`

   - **Function**: `Axis.set_ticks`

     Inside the `set_ticks` method, include a check to validate kwargs by calling `_process_text_args` regardless of whether `labels` are provided:
     - Identify the start of processing kwargs.
     - Invoke `_process_text_args(self, **kwargs)` function to validate the text properties.
     
   - **Error Handling**:
     - Raise a `TypeError` if kwargs are provided without corresponding labels.

**Example changes in the identified function**:

1. **Set default variables and validate common properties**.

2. **Raise Error if kwargs are provided without labels**.

3. **Integrate `_process_text_args()` validation**:

   

These changes ensure that any unexpected properties provided will be caught early, enhancing user feedback and reducing potential errors. 

By applying these minimal yet effective modifications, we can improve the robustness and user-friendliness of the `Axis.set_ticks` method.
