**Title**: Resolve Duplicate Symbols Sections in Index Output for Special Characters

**Problem**: 
When index entries start with special characters (e.g., `@`, `£`, `←`), the HTML output generates two sections named `Symbols`. The first section includes entries with `@` and appears before alphabetic entries, whereas the second section includes entries with `£` and `←` and appears after alphabetic entries. Both sections share the same HTML anchor, leading to navigation issues where two `Symbols` links appear at the top but only direct to the first section.

**Analysis**:
The issue seems to arise from how index entries are grouped and indexed, particularly when special characters are involved. The `Symbols` section appears twice because these special characters are not consistently recognized as being part of a single category. Special characters may have different Unicode sorting orders, causing them to be split into separate sections. Additionally, the shared anchor name further complicates the rendering of the HTML page.

To resolve this, the logic that categorizes and assigns entries to index sections needs to be adjusted. Specifically:
1. Ensure all special characters are grouped under a single `Symbols` section.
2. Adjust the anchor generation to account for these special characters and avoid duplicate anchors for sections with the same name.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sphinx/domains/__init__.py`
    - **Section**: Class `Index`
        - **Method to Modify**: `generate()`
        - **Logic**: Insert logic to normalize all special characters to fall under a unified “Symbols” category. Additionally, modify the anchor generation to ensure unique naming even for sections with identical names.

           a. Group all special characters under a single `Symbols` section.
           
           b. Create unique anchors for sections that would otherwise share the same name:
                - Before adding entries to the `Symbols` section, check if a section named `Symbols` already exists.
                - If it does not exist, create one.
                - If it does, append entries to the existing section instead of creating a new one.

2. **File**: `sphinx/domains/__init__.py`
    - **Section**: NamedTuple `IndexEntry`
        - **Logic**: Ensure that additional information like qualifier and anchor is correctly utilized to prevent duplicate anchors for the same section name. Check if the anchors generated are unique.

**Detailed Description**:

1. Modify the `generate` method in the `Index` class to categorize all special characters under a single 'Symbols' section:
    - Before starting with the character-based index creation, create a specific bucket for 'Symbols'.
    - Ensure any special character entry defined by its Unicode falls into the 'Symbols' bucket.

2. Ensure that the anchor created for the 'Symbols' section is unique if another 'Symbols' section exists:
    - Append a numerical or descriptive suffix to the anchor if an identical anchor is detected.

By following these proposed changes, we ensure that all special character entries are consolidated under one `Symbols` section, preventing the current duplication issue. Furthermore, by creating unique anchors, we ensure that HTML linking works as expected, with clear, distinct sections in the index.

**Example Changes in Function Context**:
Not providing exact code snippets but the changes would look conceptually like adjusting the way entries are categorized and anchors are generated in the mentioned functions.

1. Identify and collect all special characters.
2. Normalize them under one section before normal alphanumeric sorting and indexing.
3. Handle unique anchor generation in-index entries to avoid duplication. 

These changes should be carefully tested, especially with a variety of special characters to ensure the change is robust across different Unicode characters and edge cases.
