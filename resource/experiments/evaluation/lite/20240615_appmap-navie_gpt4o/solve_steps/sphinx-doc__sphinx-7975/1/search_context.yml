    - The new ``latex_additional_files`` config value can be used to
        copy files (that Sphinx doesn't copy automatically, e.g. if they
        are referenced in custom LaTeX added in ``latex_elements``) to
        the build directory.

    * Builders:

      - The HTML builder now stores a small file named ``.buildinfo`` in
        its output directory.  It stores a hash of config values that
        can be used to determine if a full rebuild needs to be done (e.g.
        after changing ``html_theme``).

      - New builder for Qt help collections, by Antonio Valentino.

      - The new ``DirectoryHTMLBuilder`` (short name ``dirhtml``) creates
        a separate directory for every page, and places the page there
        in a file called ``index.html``.  Therefore, page URLs and links
        don't need to contain ``.html``.

      - The new ``html_link_suffix`` config value can be used to select
        the suffix of generated links between HTML files.

        An Index is the description for a domain-specific index.  To add an index to
        a domain, subclass Index, overriding the three name attributes:

        * `name` is an identifier used for generating file names.
          It is also used for a hyperlink target for the index. Therefore, users can
          refer the index page using ``ref`` role and a string which is combined
          domain name and ``name`` attribute (ex. ``:ref:`py-modindex```).
        * `localname` is the section title for the index.
        * `shortname` is a short name for the index, for use in the relation bar in
          HTML output.  Can be empty to disable entries in the relation bar.

        and providing a :meth:`generate()` method.  Then, add the index class to
        your domain's `indices` list.  Extensions can add indices to existing
        domains using :meth:`~sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_index_to_domain()`.

        for LaTeX output.

      - Footnotes are now properly handled in the LaTeX builder: they appear
        at the location of the footnote reference in text, not at the end of
        a section.  Thanks to Andrew McNamara for the initial patch.

      - "System Message" warnings are now automatically removed from the
        built documentation, and only written to stderr.  If you want the
        old behavior, set the new config value ``keep_warnings`` to True.

      - Glossary entries are now automatically added to the index.

    - Glossary entries are now automatically added to the index.

      - Figures with captions can now be referred to like section titles,
        using the ``:ref:`` role without an explicit link text.

      - Added ``cmember`` role for consistency.

      - Lists enumerated by letters or roman numerals are now handled like in
        standard reST.

      - The ``seealso`` directive can now also be given arguments, as a short
        form.

      - You can now document several programs and their options with the
        new ``program`` directive.

    * HTML output and templates:

      - Incompatible change: The "root" relation link (top left in the
        relbar) now points to the ``master_doc`` by default, no longer to a
        document called "index".  The old behavior, while useful in some
        situations, was somewhat unexpected.  Override the "rootrellink"
        block in the template to customize where it refers to.

      - The JavaScript search now searches for objects before searching in
        the full text.

    - #10: Added HTML section numbers, enabled by giving a
        ``:numbered:`` flag to the ``toctree`` directive.

      - #114: Added an ``abbr`` role to markup abbreviations and
        acronyms.

      - The ``literalinclude`` directive now supports several more
        options, to include only parts of a file.

      - The ``toctree`` directive now supports a ``:hidden:`` flag,
        which will prevent links from being generated in place of
        the directive -- this allows you to define your document
        structure, but place the links yourself.

      - #123: The ``glossary`` directive now supports a ``:sorted:``
        flag that sorts glossary entries alphabetically.

      - Paths to images, literal include files and download files
        can now be absolute (like ``/images/foo.png``).  They are
        treated as relative to the top source directory.

      - #52: There is now a ``hlist`` directive, creating a compact
        list by placing distributing items into multiple columns.

    - The ``autodoc_skip_member`` event now also gets to decide
        whether to skip members whose name starts with underscores.
        Previously, these members were always automatically skipped.
        Therefore, if you handle this event, add something like this
        to your event handler to restore the old behavior::

           if name.startswith('_'):
               return True

    * Theming support, see the new section in the documentation.

    * Markup:

      - Due to popular demand, added a ``:doc:`` role which directly
        links to another document without the need of creating a
        label to which a ``:ref:`` could link to.

      - #4: Added a ``:download:`` role that marks a non-document file
        for inclusion into the HTML output and links to it.

      - Added an ``only`` directive that can selectively include text
        based on enabled "tags".  Tags can be given on the command
        line.  Also, the current builder output format (e.g. "html" or
        "latex") is always a defined tag.

    function

    * Support for a ``toctree_only`` item in items for the ``latex_documents``
      config value.  This only includes the documents referenced by TOC trees in the
      output, not the rest of the file containing the directive.

    Bugs fixed

    ----------


    * sphinx.htmlwriter: Correctly write the TOC file for any structure of the
      master document.  Also encode non-ASCII characters as entities in TOC
      and index file.  Remove two remaining instances of hard-coded
      "documentation".

    * sphinx.ext.autodoc: descriptors are detected properly now.


    * sphinx.latexwriter: implement all reST admonitions, not just ``note``
      and ``warning``.

    * Lots of little fixes to the LaTeX output and style.


    * Fix OpenSearch template and make template URL absolute.  The
      `html_use_opensearch` config value now must give the base URL.

    * Some unused files are now stripped from the HTML help file build.

    ``collapse``
              A boolean that determines if sub-entries should start collapsed (for
              output formats that support collapsing sub-entries).

            ``content``:
              A sequence of ``(letter, entries)`` tuples, where ``letter`` is the
              "heading" for the given ``entries``, usually the starting letter, and
              ``entries`` is a sequence of single entries. Each entry is a sequence
              ``[name, subtype, docname, anchor, extra, qualifier, descr]``. The
              items in this sequence have the following meaning:

              ``name``
                The name of the index entry to be displayed.

              ``subtype``
                The sub-entry related type. One of:

                ``0``
                  A normal entry.
                ``1``
                  An entry with sub-entries.
                ``2``
                  A sub-entry.

              ``docname``
                *docname* where the entry is located.

    * The clumsy handling of the ``index.html`` template was removed.  The
    config
      value ``html_index`` is gone, and ``html_additional_pages`` should be used
      instead.  If you need it, the old ``index.html`` template is still there,
      called ``defindex.html``, and you can port your html_index template, using
      Jinja inheritance, by changing your template::

         {% extends "defindex.html" %}
         {% block tables %}
         ... old html_index template content ...
         {% endblock %}

      and putting ``'index': name of your template`` in ``html_additional_pages``.

    * In the layout template, redundant ``block``\s were removed; you should use
      Jinja's standard ``{{ super() }}`` mechanism instead, as explained in the
      (newly written) templating docs.

    New features added

    ------------------


    * Extension API (Application object):

    - #52: There is now a ``hlist`` directive, creating a compact
        list by placing distributing items into multiple columns.

      - #77: If a description environment with info field list only
        contains one ``:param:`` entry, no bullet list is generated.

      - #6: Don't generate redundant ``<ul>`` for top-level TOC tree
        items, which leads to a visual separation of TOC entries.

      - #23: Added a ``classmethod`` directive along with ``method``
        and ``staticmethod``.

      - Scaled images now get a link to the unscaled version.

      - SVG images are now supported in HTML (via ``<object>`` and
        ``<embed>`` tags).

      - Added a ``toctree`` callable to the templates, and the ability
        to include external links in toctrees. The 'collapse' keyword
        argument indicates whether or not to only display subitems of
        the current page.  (Defaults to True.)

    * Configuration:

    - The new config value `html_file_suffix` can be used to set the
        HTML file suffix to e.g. ``.xhtml``.

      - The directories in the `html_static_path` can now contain
        subdirectories.

      - The module index now isn't collapsed if the number of submodules
        is larger than the number of toplevel modules.

    * The image directive now supports specifying the extension as ``.*``,
      which makes the builder select the one that matches best.  Thanks to
      Sebastian Wiesner.

    * The new config value `exclude_trees` can be used to exclude whole
      subtrees from the search for source files.

    * Defaults for configuration values can now be callables, which allows
      dynamic defaults.

    * The new TextBuilder creates plain-text output.

    * Python 3-style signatures, giving a return annotation via ``->``,
      are now supported.

        Directive to mark description of a new JavaScript module.

        This directive specifies the module name that will be used by objects that
        follow this directive.

        Options
        -------

        noindex
            If the ``noindex`` option is specified, no linkable elements will be
            created, and the module won't be added to the global module index. This
            is useful for splitting up the module definition across multiple
            sections or files.

    * #71: If a decoding error occurs in source files, print a
      warning and replace the characters by "?".

    * Fix a problem in the HTML search if the index takes too long
      to load.

    * Don't output system messages while resolving, because they
      would stay in the doctrees even if keep_warnings is false.

    * #82: Determine the correct path for dependencies noted by
      docutils.  This fixes behavior where a source with dependent
      files was always reported as changed.

    * Recognize toctree directives that are not on section toplevel,
      but within block items, such as tables.

    * Use a new RFC base URL, since rfc.org seems down.

    * Fix a crash in the todolist directive when no todo items are
      defined.

    * Don't call LaTeX or dvipng over and over again if it was not
      found once, and use text-only latex as a substitute in that case.

    * Fix problems with footnotes in the LaTeX output.

    * Prevent double hyphens becoming en-dashes in literal code in
      the LaTeX output.
