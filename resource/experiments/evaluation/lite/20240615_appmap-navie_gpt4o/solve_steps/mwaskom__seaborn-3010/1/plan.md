**Title**: Add Data Preprocessing to Handle Missing Values in PolyFit

**Problem**: The `PolyFit` class fails when the input data contains missing values (`None`), producing a `LinAlgError` due to non-converging SVD in Linear Least Squares fitting.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue is that `np.polyfit` does not handle missing values in the data adequately. When `None` or `NaN` values are present in either the `x` or `y` arrays, the linear algebra routines in numpy cannot compute the polynomial fit, causing the function to fail.

To rectify this, we need to preprocess the input data within the `_fit_predict` method to remove any entries where either `x` or `y` is `None` or `NaN` before attempting to fit the polynomial. This will ensure that `np.polyfit` receives only valid numeric data, allowing it to perform the computation successfully.

**Proposed Changes**: The primary change needs to be made in the `_fit_predict` method of the `PolyFit` class within the `seaborn/_stats/regression.py` file. The method should be updated to filter out rows in the input data where `x` or `y` is missing. Here is a detailed description of the necessary changes:

1. **Add Data Filtering for Missing Values**:
   - Update the `_fit_predict` method to filter out rows with missing values (`None` or `NaN`).
   
2. **Details of Change**:
   - Check for missing values in `x` and `y`, and create a mask to filter them out.
   - Apply this mask to both `x` and `y` before fitting the polynomial.
   - Adapt the fitting logic to accommodate the cleaned data.

**File**: `seaborn/_stats/regression.py`

1. **Update `_fit_predict` Method**:
   - Modify the `_fit_predict` method to filter out `None` or `NaN` values from the input `x` and `y` data:

   **Detailed Changes**:
   - Add a mask to filter out invalid entries.
   - Apply this mask to `x` and `y` before calling `np.polyfit`.

Example task breakdown:
- Read the `x` and `y` columns from the input `data`.
- Create a mask to filter rows where either `x` or `y` is null/NaN.
- Apply this mask to `x` and `y` to get cleaned arrays.
- Proceed with the existing polyfit logic using these cleaned arrays.

By making these changes, the `PolyFit` class will become robust against input data containing missing values, thus preventing the issues with non-converging SVD during polynomial fitting.
