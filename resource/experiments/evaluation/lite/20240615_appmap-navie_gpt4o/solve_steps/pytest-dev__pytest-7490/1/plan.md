### Title
Update logic in `_pytest.mark.structures.py` to ensure dynamically added xfail markers behave consistently with pytest 5.x

### Problem
In pytest 6.0.0rc0, dynamically adding an `xfail` marker to a test using `request.node.add_marker(mark)` does not properly ignore failures like it did in pytest 5.x. This regression results in tests failing that should be marked as expected failures (xfail).

### Analysis
The issue resides in how the `xfail` markers are being processed in pytest 6.x compared to 5.x. During test execution, pytest appears to be treating dynamically added markers differently, failing to handle the expected failure condition appropriately.

Specifically, the changes introduced in pytest 6.x may have altered the internal handling of test markers, potentially missing the integration point where such dynamic markers are checked and processed appropriately. The logic needs to be corrected to ensure that dynamically added xfail markers are respected and processed before test assertion failures are evaluated.

### Proposed Changes
To address this issue, adjustments are needed in the `get_empty_parameterset_mark` function and potentially in other related functions that deal with markers within the same file. The aim is to ensure that dynamically added markers are accounted for correctly during test execution.

1. **File: `src/_pytest/mark/structures.py`**
   - **Function: `get_empty_parameterset_mark`**
     - Ensure that this function processes the xfail marker consistently whether it's added dynamically or statically.
     - Modify the logic to include a check for dynamically added xfail markers and handle them appropriately to make sure test assertions respect the xfail expectations.

2. **File: `src/_pytest/mark/structures.py`**
   - **Function: `__getattr__`**
     - This function is responsible for handling marker attributes dynamically. Ensure this function includes logic to merge dynamically added markers properly and to process them in a way that treats xfail markers correctly.

### Detailed Changes
1. **In `get_empty_parameterset_mark` function:**
   - Update or add logic to check for dynamically added xfail markers in the test node.
   - Ensure the reason and other xfail parameters are appropriately handled during the test execution.

2. **In `__getattr__` function:**
   - Enhance the handling of dynamic markers by ensuring they are fully integrated with the existing markers on the test node.
   - Implement a mechanism to merge and process these markers, particularly focusing on xfail to ensure they cause the test to be marked as an xfail when expected.

By addressing these points, you should restore the expected behavior of dynamically added xfail markers in pytest 6.x, aligning it with how it worked in pytest 5.x.
