**Title**: Fix `PolynomialError` in `subs` for Hyperbolic Functions with Piecewise Arguments

**Problem**: 
An unexpected `PolynomialError` is raised when substituting integer values with floats in expressions containing hyperbolic functions (`cosh`, `tanh`, or `sinh`) with piecewise arguments, and real symbols. This issue is specific to certain expressions in Sympy version 1.8.dev and is preventing correct execution in a TensorFlow lambdify context.

**Analysis**: 
The error originates from the interaction of hyperbolic functions (`sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh`), the `Piecewise` structure, and the `subs` method in Sympy. When these specific conditions are met:

1. The hyperbolic function is applied to a `Piecewise` expression divided by a symbol.
2. The symbols in `Piecewise` are declared as real.
3. The `subs` method attempts to substitute integers with floats.
4. This combination triggers the `PolynomialError`.

The error specifically mentions "Piecewise generators do not make sense," which indicates that the issue lies in how hyperbolic functions interact with the assumptions and rewriting rules applied during substitution, especially when the cache is cleared or assumptions change.

**Proposed Changes**: 
To resolve the issue, modifications should be made to the handling of hyperbolic functions when rewriting them in terms of other expressions, ensuring compatibility with `Piecewise`. We will focus on preventing the `PolynomialError` during the substitution process by modifying the relevant method in the `hyperbolic.py` file.

1. **sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py**:
   - Review functions `_eval_rewrite_as_tractable`, `_eval_rewrite_as_exp`, `_eval_rewrite_as_cosh`, `_eval_rewrite_as_tanh`, and similar methods for `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` classes.
   - Ensure that these methods handle `Piecewise` arguments correctly, possibly by adding checks and handling specific to `Piecewise`.
   - Ensure that the interaction between hyperbolic functions and `Piecewise` does not produce invalid polynomial generators, even when assumptions change or cache is cleared.

**Example of Changes**:
   
1. **For `sinh` class**:
   - Modify `_eval_rewrite_as_exp` to handle `Piecewise` effectively:



2. **Review Similar Functions**:
   - Apply similar changes for `cosh` and `tanh` functions to ensure they can handle `Piecewise` arguments appropriately without triggering `PolynomialError`.



By making these targeted adjustments, the `subs` method should no longer trigger `PolynomialError` for these specific cases, improving the robustness of `sinh`, `cosh`, and `tanh` functions when dealing with `Piecewise` arguments and real symbols. This ensures that converting the expression to TensorFlow code works correctly without encountering type errors.
