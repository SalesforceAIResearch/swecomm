**Title: Update `idiff` to support `Eq` and functions of `x` as dependent variable**

**Problem:**
The `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py` has issues with handling equation objects (`Eq`) and functions of `x` (e.g., `f(x)`) as dependent variables. Currently, it raises errors when encountering these scenarios.

**Analysis:**
The `idiff` function currently expects the dependent variable `y` to be either a sequence or a `Symbol`. When the input is an equation object (`Eq`), `idiff` doesn’t recognize it appropriately and cannot proceed with solving the implicit differentiation. Similarly, when `y` is a function of `x`, the function isn’t recognized, causing it to fail as well.

To resolve this, we need:
1. To handle cases where `y` is a function (e.g., `f(x)`).
2. To ensure that `Eq` objects are correctly processed.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Handle Functions of `x` in `idiff`:**
   - Modify the initial checks to include cases where `y` is an instance of a function, such as `f(x)`.
   - Retrieve the correct dependencies for functions.

2. **Support for `Eq` Objects:**
   - Convert `Eq` objects to expressions by subtracting the right-hand side from the left-hand side.

**Specific Updates in `sympy/geometry/util.py`:**

1. **Update the `idiff` function:**

   - **Modify the `y` parameter handling to support functions:**
     - Check if `y` is an instance of `AppliedUndef`, common for `f(x)`.
     - Use `y.free_symbols` to determine its dependencies.

   - **Handle `Eq` objects:**
     - Convert the `Eq` object to an expression for differentiation.

Change the function `idiff` in the following manner:

- **Before:**



- **After:**



By making these changes, `idiff` will be able to process equation objects (Eq) and handle functions of `x` as dependent variables.
