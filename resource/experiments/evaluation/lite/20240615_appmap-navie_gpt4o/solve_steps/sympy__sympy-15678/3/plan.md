**Title**: Update `idiff` to Support `Eq` and Function Expressions

**Problem**: The `idiff` function in the `sympy/geometry/util.py` module does not support the `Eq` equality operator, nor does it allow the dependent variable `y` to be expressed as a function (e.g., `f(x)`). This leads to IndexError and ValueError exceptions when used with these formats.

**Analysis**: The `idiff` function currently expects the equation to be expressed as a basic algebraic expression and the dependent variable to be a simple symbol. However, it should also support:
1. Equations expressed using SymPy's `Eq` class, which represents equality.
2. Dependent variables that are functions of another variable (e.g., `f(x)`).

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Modify `idiff` to Support `Eq` Objects**:
   - Check if the provided equation (`eq`) is an instance of `Eq`.
   - If it is, extract the left-hand side of the equation and use it for further processing.
   
2. **Modify `idiff` to Support Functions as Dependent Variables**:
   - Check if the dependent variable (`y`) is a function.
   - If it is, handle `Function` objects appropriately by extracting the base symbol and modifying the function accordingly.

### Detailed Implementation:
1. **Change in Function Signature and Initial Checks**:
   - Update the initial type and content checks for the equation and the dependent variable.

2. **Adjust `solve` and `subs` Operations**:
   - Ensure the `solve` and `subs` operations are compatible with the extracted parts of the equation and the dependent variable when these are functions or `Eq` objects.

**File to Change: `sympy/geometry/util.py`**

1. **Function `idiff`**:
   

### Changes:
1. **Support for `Eq` Objects**:
    - **Line 572**: `if isinstance(eq, Eq): eq = eq.lhs - eq.rhs`
    - This line of code converts an `Eq` object to its left-hand side minus its right-hand side, transforming it into an expression.

2. **Support for Functions as Dependent Variables**:
    - **Line 573-575**: Modify type checking and extraction:
      - `if is_sequence(y):` -> `if isinstance(y, (list, tuple)):`
      - `elif isinstance(y, Function):` -> Handle functions:
        - Extract the base symbol from the function: `y_base = y.args[0]`
        - Define `f` to map symbols to corresponding functions.
        - Adjust the `derivs` dictionary to handle functions appropriately.

3. **Update Main Loop and Return**:
    - **Line 583-585**: Adjust the derivation and substitution logic to ensure compatibility with functions:
      - `yp = solve(eq.diff(x), dydx)[0].subs(derivs)`
      - `return yp.subs([(v, k) for k, v in f.items()])`

By implementing these changes, the `idiff` function will become more robust, supporting a wider range of inputs, including equations expressed as `Eq` objects and dependent variables defined as functions.
