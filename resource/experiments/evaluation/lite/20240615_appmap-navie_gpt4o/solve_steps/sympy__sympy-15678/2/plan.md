**Title**: Enhance `idiff` to Support `Eq` and `Function` for Dependent Variables

**Problem**
The current implementation of the `idiff` function in `sympy/geometry/util.py` does not support equations represented as `Eq` nor does it handle cases where the dependent variable is specified as a function of the independent variable (e.g., `f(x)` instead of `y`). This leads to errors such as `IndexError` and `ValueError` when such cases are encountered.

**Analysis**
The function `idiff` is used for implicit differentiation assuming that the equation is equal to zero. Presently, the function faces two primary issues:
1. It does not handle `Eq` objects properly and directly assumes equations are provided in a simple expression form equating to zero.
2. It expects the dependent variable to be a simple `Symbol` and does not support instances when it's provided as a `Function` of the independent variable.

To address these, the following modifications are necessary:
1. Detect and appropriately handle `Eq` objects by transforming them into expressions.
2. Extend the support for `Function` objects by validating and appropriately extracting symbols when `f(x)` is used instead of just `y`.

**Proposed Changes**
1. Modify `idiff` to accept and handle `Eq` objects by converting them to expressions:
   - Check if the equation (`eq`) is an instance of `Eq` and simplify it into the standard form (`lhs - rhs = 0`).

2. Enhance `idiff` to process dependent variables given as `Function`:
   - Validate and transform `Function` instances appropriately.
   - Ensure that the differentiation process uses the correct forms involving function evaluations.

The specific changes are:

1. **sympy/geometry/util.py:528-565**
   - Update the function signature and initial validation logic to handle `Eq` and `Function`.

2. **sympy/geometry/util.py:561-587**
   - Modify the processing logic where the equation `eq` is manipulated to accommodate the new forms (i.e., handling `Eq` objects and `Function` dependent variables).

Proposed detailed steps in `sympy/geometry/util.py`:
   
1. **Function signature and initial validation updates:**
   - Check if `eq` is an instance of `Eq` and convert it to an expression by subtracting `rhs` from `lhs`.
   - Verify if `y` is an instance of `Function` and handle accordingly.

2. **Main processing within `idiff`:**
   - Wrap the main differentiation logic to ensure it accommodates the validated forms of the equation and dependent variable.
   - Ensure proper substitution and differentiation steps reflect handling of both `Symbol` and `Function` dependent variables to avoid `IndexError` and `ValueError`.

These improvements will safely extend the functionality of `idiff` to support both `Eq` objects and function-based dependent variables without disrupting existing functionalities. This approach ensures backward compatibility and extends existing functionality to cover more use cases.
