**Title**: Modify KeyTransformIsNull to Correctly Handle `isnull=True` on SQLite and Oracle

**Problem**:
The `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup works properly for `isnull=False` by using the logic from `HasKey`. However, when `isnull=True`, the lookup should only match objects that do not have the key. For MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, the query matches objects correctly. However, for SQLite and Oracle, the query incorrectly matches objects that have the key with a `null` value.

**Analysis**:
The key issue resides in the handling of `isnull=True` in the `KeyTransformIsNull` class for SQLite and Oracle backends. Currently, the logic for these databases incorrectly matches keys that exist with a `null` value when `isnull=True` is used. The expected behavior is for the query to match only objects that do not have the key at all, ignoring keys with `null` values.

**Proposed Changes**:
We need to update the `as_sqlite` and `as_oracle` methods within the `KeyTransformIsNull` class to ensure they only match objects where the key does not exist when `isnull=True`.

1. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/json.py`
   - **Class**: `KeyTransformIsNull`
     - **Method**: `as_sqlite`
       - Modify the condition for `isnull=True` to ensure it only matches objects that do not contain the key. This can be achieved by changing the SQL clause to exclude keys with a `null` value.
     - **Method**: `as_oracle`
       - Similarly, adjust the SQL generation for Oracle to ensure keys with `null` values are not matched when `isnull=True`.

Ensure that the logic checks for the existence of the key only, and avoids matching keys that explicitly have a `null` value.

An example logic adjustment could be to use `JSON_TYPE` or equivalent functions in SQLite and `JSON_EXISTS` in Oracle to ensure the key presence is checked without considering the value.

By making these changes, the issue where the query incorrectly matches keys with `null` values on SQLite and Oracle will be resolved.
