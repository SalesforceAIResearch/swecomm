**Title: Modify migration command to respect specified database parameter when adding permissions**

**Problem:** 
When invoking the `migrate` management command with a specified database parameter, a DB read request still occurs using the DB router, not the specified database. This issue arises in a multi-tenant setup with a custom middleware and DB router.

**Analysis:**
The issue likely occurs because the logic for adding permissions during the `migrate` command does not correctly respect the specified database parameter and instead always refers to the database router. To fix this, the code must be updated to ensure all DB operations within the `migrate` command context use the explicitly specified database.

The provided Django code snippets show middleware and a DB router that dynamically selects a database based on a subdomain. When a migration is run with a database parameter, it is expected to bypass the DB routing logic and use the specified database directly.

Upon deeper analysis, the root of the issue seems to be where the Django `migrate` command might not respect the `database` parameter during operations like adding permissions.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: `django/db/migrations/operations/base.py`**

   **Function: `allow_migrate_model`**

   Add logic in the `allow_migrate_model` method to respect the specified database parameter during the migration.

   **Change Details:**
   - Modify the `allow_migrate_model` method to check if the database is explicitly provided and use it for any subsequent DB read/write operations.
   - Ensure that no calls are made to the DB router passed in the hints if the database is explicitly specified in the migration.

   **Detailed Description:**
   - Introduce a check to determine if the `database` parameter is provided in the migration context.
   - If the database is specified, bypass any call to the DB router methods (such as `router.allow_migrate`, `router.allow_relation`, etc.).
   - Directly use the provided database parameter for all DB operations within the migration management command.

    Update the function implementation to look something like:
    

   Integrate the changes primarily at code lines identified around 117-139, ensuring that database parameter checks and resulting logic are correctly and explicitly handled there.

This change ensures that all database operations within the migrate management command context respect the specified database parameter, preventing unintended DB router invocations.
