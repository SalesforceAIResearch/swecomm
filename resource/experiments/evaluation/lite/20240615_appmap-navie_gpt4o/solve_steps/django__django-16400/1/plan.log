**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

migrate management command does not respect database parameter when adding Permissions.
Description

When invoking migrate with a database parameter, the migration runs successfully. However, there seems to be a DB read request that runs after the migration. This call does not respect the db param and invokes the db router .
When naming the db as a parameter, all DB calls in the context of the migrate command are expected to use the database specified.
I came across this as I am currently using a thread-local variable to get the active DB with a custom DB router for a multi-tenant service .
Minimal example 
Setup the custom middleware and custom DB Router as show below. Then run any DB migration. We see that "read {}" is being printed... (2396)
