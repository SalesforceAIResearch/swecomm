**Title**: Detect infinite solution scenarios in `solve_poly_system`

**Problem**: The function `solve_poly_system` does not correctly handle the case where it should detect infinite solutions. This leads to incorrect results instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`.

**Analysis**:
- The issue arises in the `_solve_reduced_system` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`. When given a polynomial system with infinite solutions, such as `(y - 1,)` with generators `(x, y)`, it incorrectly returns a solution instead of raising an error.
- The problem is due to the logic that checks for the presence of a univariate polynomial in the Groebner basis but does not consider the length of the generators correctly. If there is one univariate polynomial but more than one generator, it still proceeds without recognizing that the system might have infinite solutions.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`
    - **Function**: `_solve_reduced_system`
    - **Change**: Modify the condition to check that there is exactly one univariate polynomial and only one generator. If there are multiple generators, raise a `NotImplementedError` indicating the system might have infinite solutions.
        - Update the `if` condition at line 241 from:
          `if len(univariate) == 1:`
          to:
          `if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == 1:`
    - **Logic**:
        - This change ensures that a system will only proceed if it has exactly one univariate polynomial and one generator, indicating a zero-dimensional system with finite solutions.
        - If either condition is not met, it raises `NotImplementedError`, signaling a potential infinite solution scenario.

By implementing the above change, `solve_poly_system` will correctly detect cases with infinite solutions and raise appropriate errors.
