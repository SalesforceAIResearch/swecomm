### Title
Fix detection of infinite solutions in `solve_poly_system` function

### Problem
The `solve_poly_system` function fails to correctly detect infinite solution cases when the system of polynomial equations is not zero-dimensional. Specifically, it incorrectly handles cases where there is more than one variable and only one equation, which can lead to an incorrect return of finite solutions instead of raising a `NotImplementedError`.

### Analysis
The root of the issue lies in the `_solve_reduced_system` function, which is responsible for solving reduced polynomial systems. The function currently checks if the basis generated by the Groebner basis computation contains only one univariate polynomial. If true, it proceeds to solve the univariate polynomial without considering the number of variables involved (`gens`). 

For a correct implementation, the function should also check if the number of generators (variables) is one when there is only one univariate polynomial. This ensures that the system is zero-dimensional and has a finite number of solutions. If there are multiple generators, it should raise a `NotImplementedError` to signify that the system is not zero-dimensional (it has potentially infinite solutions).

### Proposed Changes
**File**: `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`

1. **_solve_reduced_system function (lines 216-292)**:
    - Update the condition that checks if there is only one univariate polynomial and ensure that the number of generators is also one before proceeding with solving.

   Modify the following section:
   
   to
   

### Detailed Description of Changes
1. **_solve_reduced_system function**:
   - Locate the `_solve_reduced_system` function in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`.
   - Find the condition that checks for univariate polynomials:
     
   - Modify this condition to also check if `gens` contains only one generator:
     

By making this modification, the function will correctly identify cases with infinite solutions and raise the appropriate `NotImplementedError`. 

Remember to run your existing test suite to ensure that the changes do not adversely affect other functionality.
