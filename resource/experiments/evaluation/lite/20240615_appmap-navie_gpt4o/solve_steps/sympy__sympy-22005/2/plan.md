**Title**: Detect Infinite Solutions in Polynomial Systems

**Problem**: The current implementation of `solve_poly_system` does not correctly handle cases where the system has infinite solutions. Specifically, when there is at least one generator missing in the solution, it incorrectly returns finite solutions.

**Analysis**: The issue occurs because the method `_solve_reduced_system` does not verify if all generators have a corresponding univariate polynomial. If the polynomial basis is univariate but not all generators are involved, the method should recognize this as a case of infinite solutions rather than returning an incomplete solution.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`
    - **Function**: `_solve_reduced_system`
        - Modify the conditional check for a univariate basis to also ensure that the number of generators is one. This will prevent the incorrect detection of finite solutions when there are actually infinite solutions.

    
      
    **Justification**:
    - The condition `len(univariate) == 1` ensures there's only one univariate polynomial in the basis.
    - The additional condition `len(gens) == 1` ensures that all variables are solved, thereby confirming it's a zero-dimensional system (which should have a finite number of solutions).

By adding this additional check, the method will correctly identify scenarios where there are infinite solutions and raise an appropriate `NotImplementedError`.

Make sure to test these changes using appropriate test cases to confirm the issue is resolved correctly.
