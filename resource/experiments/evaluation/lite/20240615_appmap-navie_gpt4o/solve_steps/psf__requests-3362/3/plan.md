**Title**: Ensure `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True` Returns Unicode

**Problem**:
When fetching an `application/json` document using `requests`, calling `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True` returns bytes instead of a unicode object, whereas accessing `r.text` yields unicode. This inconsistency suggests that `iter_content` does not behave as an "iter_text" when `decode_unicode` is set to True, which is contrary to user expectations.

**Analysis**:
The root of this issue lies in the implementation of `iter_content` and its handling of the `decode_unicode` flag within the `requests.models.Response` class. When `decode_unicode=True`, the function should decode chunks to unicode as it iterates. However, this is currently not happening, causing `iter_content` to still return bytes.

Here is how this works in two scenarios:
1. `r.text`: The property accesses the `content` attribute and properly decodes it based on the detected or specified encoding.
2. `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)`: Despite setting `decode_unicode` to True, the function doesn't appropriately decode the chunks to unicode, instead returning raw bytes.

To resolve this inconsistency, we must ensure the `iter_content` method decodes each chunk into a unicode object when `decode_unicode=True`.

**Proposed Changes**:
We'll focus on modifying the `iter_content` method in `requests/models.py` to ensure proper unicode decoding when `decode_unicode` is set to True.

1. **File**: `requests/models.py`
   **Function**: `iter_content`
   **Location**: Relevant portions are around lines 660-684 and 684-708.

   **Modification**:
   - In the `iter_content` method, after obtaining the chunk, check if `decode_unicode` is True.
   - If `decode_unicode` is True, decode the byte chunk to a unicode string using `self.encoding`.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Identify Chunk Handling**:
   Locate the section within the `generate` method where chunks are yielded. This can be found within the `iter_content` method.

2. **Apply Decoding Logic**:
   After fetching each chunk but before yielding it:
   - Verify if `decode_unicode` is True.
   - Apply decoding using the response's encoding attribute.
   
3. **Update Code**:
   - Ensure the decoding respects error handling, similar to how `r.text` handles decoding errors.

**Changes**:
python
  if decode_unicode and chunk:
      # Ensure the encoding is determined as in `r.text` property.
      encoding = self.encoding or self.apparent_encoding
      try:
          chunk = chunk.decode(encoding, errors='replace')
      except (LookupError, TypeError):
          # Fail-safe decoding if the specified encoding is invalid or None.
          chunk = chunk.decode(errors='replace')
   ```
4. **Testing**:
   - Verify the consistency between `r.text` and `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)`.
   - Test with various encodings to ensure robustness.

This ensures that when `iter_content` is used with `decode_unicode=True`, it behaves as expected, yielding text (unicode) similarly to `r.text`.

Note: Ensure that any changes follow the existing project style and error handling mechanisms. Avoid altering or impacting downstream functionality unintentionally.
