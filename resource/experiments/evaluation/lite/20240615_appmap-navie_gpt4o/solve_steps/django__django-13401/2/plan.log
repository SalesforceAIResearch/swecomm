**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Abstract model field should not be equal across models
Description
	
Consider the following models:
class A(models.Model):
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
	myfield = IntegerField()
class B(A):
	pass
class C(A):
	pass
If I pull the fields of B and C into a shared set, one will be de-duplicated away, because they compare as equal. I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.
len({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1
B._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')
We should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it ... (1276)
