**Title: Modify Django Model Field Comparison Logic to Consider Different Models Unequal**

**Problem:**
Currently, fields in Django models only consider `self.creation_counter` when comparing for equality. This causes fields with the same `creation_counter` value from different models to be considered equal. As a result, when pulling fields from different models into a shared set, one might be de-duplicated away unexpectedly. This behavior is not intuitive, as fields from different models should not be considered equal.

**Analysis:**
Django model field comparison logic is currently leading to a surprising behavior when fields from different models compare as equal. This is because only the `self.creation_counter` attribute is considered during equality (`__eq__`) checks. Consequently, fields from different models but with the same `creation_counter` value can be considered equal.

To address this, we need to modify the equality (`__eq__`), hashing (`__hash__`), and ordering (`__lt__`) methods for model fields to account for the fields' parent models. By doing so, we ensure that fields from different models do not compare as equal, even if their `creation_counter` values are identical.

1. **Modify `__eq__`:** Adjust the method to also consider the `model` attribute. If two fields have the same `creation_counter` but different `model`, they should not be equal.
2. **Modify `__hash__`:** Update the hash method to consider the `model` attribute along with `creation_counter`.
3. **Modify `__lt__`:** Adjust the ordering logic to first consider the `creation_counter` and, in the case of a tie, the `model`.

**Proposed Changes:**
Focusing on the file that handles Django's model field logic, we will make modifications to the equality, hashing, and ordering methods.

**File to be Changed:**
- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`

**Details of Changes:**
1. **Modify the `__eq__` Method:**
   - Locate the `__eq__` method in the model field class.
   - Adjust the logic to include a comparison of the `model` attribute in addition to `self.creation_counter`.

2. **Modify the `__hash__` Method:**
   - Locate the `__hash__` method in the model field class.
   - Update the method to combine the hash of the `model` attribute with the hash of `self.creation_counter`.

3. **Modify the `__lt__` Method:**
   - Locate the `__lt__` method in the model field class.
   - Adjust the ordering logic to first compare by `self.creation_counter` and then by the `model` attribute to prevent re-ordering of fields unnecessarily.

By making these changes, we ensure that fields from different models are always compared correctly, accounting for their parent model, and prevent unexpected field de-duplication in sets.

This modification maintains intuitive behavior and resolves the surprising issue without affecting existing unaffected cases. Once the changes are implemented, thoroughly test to ensure it correctly differentiates fields from different models and maintains correct ordering and hashing behavior.
