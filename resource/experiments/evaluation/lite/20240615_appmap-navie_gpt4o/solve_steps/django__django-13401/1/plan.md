**Title**: Adjust comparison methods in `Field` class to account for different models

**Problem**:

Currently, fields that originate from abstract models are considered equal even if they belong to different derived models. This behavior is counter-intuitive and could lead to unexpected de-duplication when these fields are put into sets or compared using `==`. This happens because the fields only consider `self.creation_counter` when comparing for equality. Therefore, `fields in different models` with identical meta fields but different models should compare as unequal. 

**Analysis**:

To address this problem, we need to modify the `__eq__`, `__hash__`, and `__lt__` methods of the `Field` class. Specifically:
1. **Equality (`__eq__`)**: Two fields should not be considered equal if they belong to different models, even if all other attributes are the same.
2. **Hash (`__hash__`)**: The hash value should incorporate the field's model to ensure fields from different models do not collide.
3. **Less than (`__lt__`)**: The ordering should initially consider `self.model`, ensuring fields from different models are treated as distinct.

**Proposed Changes**:

The modifications should be made in the file `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` where the `Field` class is defined. Here's a detailed description of the suggested changes:

1. **Equality (`__eq__`)**:
    - Modify the `__eq__` method to include a check for `self.model`. If `self.model` is not equal to `other.model`, the fields should compare as not equal.

2. **Hash (`__hash__`)**:
    - Override the `__hash__` method to also include `self.model` in the final hash value. This ensures that fields from different models will have different hash values, thus avoiding collisions in sets.

3. **Less than (`__lt__`)**:
    - Amend the `__lt__` method to first compare `self.model`. Only if the models are the same should it fall back to comparing `self.creation_counter`.

Changes should be applied specifically to the `Field` class methods as follows:

1. **Update `__eq__` Method**:
    - In the `Field` class, the `__eq__` method should compare `self.model` before other attributes.

2. **Override `__hash__` Method**:
    - Include `self.model` in the hash function to ensure fields from different models produce different hash values.

3. **Modify `__lt__` Method**:
    - Ensure that `self.model` is the first comparison criterion, followed by `self.creation_counter`.

These changes will make the comparison behavior of fields more intuitive and prevent unexpected collisions when fields are stored in sets or compared for equality based on limited attributes.

Here's a specific example of where to make these changes:

* **File**: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`
  * **Function**: `Field.__eq__`, `Field.__hash__`, `Field.__lt__`

Update the following methods in the `Field` class:

**Field.__eq__**
- Incorporate `self.model` check in the comparison logic. 

**Field.__hash__**
- Override to include `self.model` in the hash construction.

**Field.__lt__**
- Add `self.model` comparison before `self.creation_counter`.

This will ensure that fields originating from different models are treated as distinct in equality checks and ordering operations. Ensure tests are run to verify the adjustments donâ€™t break existing functionality.
