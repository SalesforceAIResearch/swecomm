**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Differences among the results of KernelPCA with rbf kernel
Hi there,
I met with a problem:

#### Description
When I run KernelPCA for dimension reduction for the same datasets, the results are different in signs.

#### Steps/Code to Reproduce
Just to reduce the dimension to 7 with rbf kernel:
pca = KernelPCA(n_components=7, kernel='rbf', copy_X=False, n_jobs=-1)
pca.fit_transform(X)

#### Expected Results
The same result.

#### Actual Results
The results are the same except for their signs:(
[[-0.44457617 -0.18155886 -0.10873474  0.13548386 -0.1437174  -0.057469	0.18124364]]
