**Title**: Normalize the signs of the eigenvectors in KernelPCA with RBF kernel

**Problem**:
When using the `KernelPCA` class with the RBF kernel to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset, the signs of the resulting eigenvectors vary between runs, even if the data and settings remain identical.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises due to the inherent properties of eigenvectors. Eigenvectors are determined up to a sign, meaning if $\mathbf{v}$ is an eigenvector, then $-\mathbf{v}$ is also an eigenvector. Because of this, different runs of the algorithm can produce eigenvectors with differing signs, even if the data and configurations are the same.

To prevent this inconsistency, the eigenvectors can be post-processed to ensure a consistent sign. One common approach is to enforce a sign convention, for instance, ensuring the largest component (in absolute value) of each eigenvector is always positive.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `_fit_transform` method within the `sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py` file to normalize the signs of the eigenvectors to ensure consistency.

### File Modification:
**File**: `sklearn/decomposition/kernel_pca.py`

1. **Method `_fit_transform`**:
    - After the computation of eigenvectors (represented by `self.alphas_`), modify the sign of each eigenvector to ensure that the largest component (in absolute value) is positive.

#### Detailed Steps:

1. **Locate the Computation of Eigenvectors**:
   After the kernel has been centered and the eigen-decomposition has been performed, locate the part where `self.alphas_` and `self.lambdas_` are assigned.

2. **Sign Normalization**:
   Add a loop to iterate over each eigenvector (column in `self.alphas_`) and enforce the sign normalization.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Ensure the element with the largest absolute value in each eigenvector is made positive.

#### Example:


In summary, the changes involve post-processing the eigenvectors within the `_fit_transform` method to ensure a consistent sign convention, thereby resolving the issue of inconsistent signs across different runs.
