**Title**: Fix pretty_printing for sympy.vector objects to avoid unit vector misplacement in terminal

**Problem**: There is an issue with the pretty_print function for sympy.vector objects, where unit vectors are incorrectly placed in the output when displayed in the terminal.

**Analysis**: The root of the problem lies in how the sympy.vector objects are handled by the pretty_printing mechanism. Specifically, the unit vectors (e.g., \( \mathbf{i_C} \), \( \mathbf{j_C} \), \( \mathbf{k_C} \)) are inserted inappropriately into the expression, causing a jumbled output. This suggests that there's an issue with the concatenation or formatting logic within the pretty printing process for vector components.

To fix this, the pretty printer for sympy.vector objects should ensure that unit vectors and coefficients are correctly aligned and that the vectors are displayed in a formatted manner without disrupting the structure of the output.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py`

   - **Function**: `_sympystr(self, printer)`
   
     **Change**: Modify the logic to correctly format the unit vectors along with their coefficients within vector expressions. This involves:
       - Ensuring that unit vectors are concatenated at the end of their respective coefficients.
       - Handling coefficients and unit vectors in a way that maintains the correctness of mathematical expressions.
   
   - **Function**: `init_vprinting(**kwargs)`
   
     **Change**: Update initialization logic for custom printing to handle vector-specific formatting cases. Ensure that `vsstrrepr`, `vpprint`, and `vlatex` are properly configured to manage unit vectors in sympy.vector objects without causing layout issues.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of necessary edits:

1. **Update `_sympystr` Function:**
   - Inspect the current method handling of unit vectors and coefficients.
   - Adjust the concatenation logic to ensure unit vectors appear correctly.

2. **Ensure Proper Initialization in `init_vprinting`:**
   - Verify arguments passed to `vsstrrepr`, `vpprint`, and `vlatex` to ensure vector components are appropriately handled.

Please make these changes in the `sympy/physics/vector/printing.py` file's described sections to address the formatting problem with sympy.vector objects.

By doing this, the pretty_print function for sympy.vector objects will generate correct and readable outputs without misplacing unit vectors in the terminal.
