Based on the provided issue description and code selection, we'll address the rendering issue of first-level domain directives when `rst_prolog` is set. The focus will be on modifying the `prepend_prolog` function in `sphinx/util/rst.py` to ensure it correctly handles domain directive headings.

Here's the detailed change:

### Changes to be made in `sphinx/util/rst.py`:

**1. Modify the `prepend_prolog` function:**
Ensure that the domain directive headings are preserved and correctly parsed after prepending the `rst_prolog`.

### Explanation of Change:

1. **Domain Directive Handling**:
   - If the first non-empty line after docinfo lines is a domain directive (e.g., `:mod:`), it shouldn't be disrupted. 
   - We check for lines starting with `:` and exclude lines containing `::` (as these are block directives, not inline).

2. **Preserve Heading Level**:
   - If a domain directive is found, the code reformats it to ensure it maintains its heading status after the `rst_prolog` is inserted.
   - This ensures the directive and its content are parsed correctly and displayed as expected in the documentation.

By implementing these changes, we ensure that `rst_prolog` does not interfere with top-level domain directive headings, maintaining their correct interpretation and inclusion in the toctree.

### Test Cases:

We will need to verify:
- That documents with `rst_prolog` set render correctly when domain directives appear as the first heading.
- The directives are included in the toctree and correctly parsed as headings.
