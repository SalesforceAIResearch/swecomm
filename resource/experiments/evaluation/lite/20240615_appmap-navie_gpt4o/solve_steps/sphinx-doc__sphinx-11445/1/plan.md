### Title
Fix handling of domain directives as top-level headings when `rst_prolog` is set

### Problem
When `rst_prolog` is set, documents containing a domain directive as the first heading (e.g., `:mod:`) fail to render the heading correctly or include it in the toctree. The issue is reproducible even in older Sphinx versions and manifests through incorrect display and missing headings in generated documentation.

### Analysis
The root cause seems to stem from how `rst_prolog` is prepended to the document content. The handling of the document during rendering might not account correctly for domain directives when inserted after prepending `rst_prolog`. Thus, heading levels and domain directives can potentially get misparsed, leading to the aforementioned issues.

Some key points to address:
- Ensure proper insertion of `rst_prolog` without affecting the parsing of first-level domain headings.
- Verify that the heading and its contents are appropriately recognized as top-level sections in the document.
- Fix the display and inclusion in the toctree.

### Proposed Changes
The issue likely lies in how the `append_prolog` function (or equivalent logic) modifies document content. The change should ensure that prepending `rst_prolog` doesn’t interfere with subsequent heading processing.

**File to be changed: `sphinx/util/rst.py`**
1. **Function: `prepend_prolog`**
    - Modify the function to handle the case where a domain directive is the first heading. Ensure that the function appends `rst_prolog` appropriately without interfering with the first heading, particularly when it’s a domain directive.
    - Implement an additional check or transformation that ensures domain directives properly maintain their heading level and integration with the document structure after prepending `rst_prolog`.

**Detailed Changes:**
1. **Modify `prepend_prolog` function:**
   - Add a check to determine if the first non-empty line after prepending `rst_prolog` starts with a domain directive.
   - If it does, ensure the directive and heading are interpreted correctly.

2. **Ensure correct parsing of domain directives as headings:**
   - Adjust the logic in `prepend_prolog` to explicitly handle domain directive headings by preserving their context and ensuring they are treated as headings.

After these modifications, verify the changes using the provided reproduction steps to ensure the headings display correctly and are included in the toctree. This way, we can ensure that the integrity of the documentation structure is maintained even after `rst_prolog` is set.
