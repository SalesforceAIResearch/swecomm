**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Solve the problem as if you... (2655)
2ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**
This is a description of the problem that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused ond describing the problem fully as a software Issue, aka Ticket.

2ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

Using rst_prolog removes top level headings containing a domain directive
### Describe the bug

If `rst_prolog` is set, then any documents that contain a domain directive as the first heading (eg `:mod:`) do not render the heading correctly or include the heading in the toctree.

In the example below, if the heading of `docs/mypackage.rst` were `mypackage2` instead of `:mod:mypackage2` then the heading displays correctly.
Similarly, if you do not set `rst_prolog` then the heading will display correctly.

This appears to have been broken for some time because I can reproduce it in v4.0.0 of Sphinx

### How to Reproduce

```bash
$ sphinx-quickstart --no-sep --project mypackage --author me -v 0.1.0 --release 0.1.0 --language en docs
$ echo -e 'Welcome\n=======\n\n.. toct... (1768)
