**Title**: Update Migration Operations for Meta.index_together to Meta.indexes Transition

**Problem**: Squashing migrations with the `Meta.index_together -> Meta.indexes` transition should remove deprecation warnings. Currently, this transition generates deprecation warnings in Django version 4.2, and the user cannot eliminate those warnings without rewriting migrations manually.

**Analysis**: 
The deprecation warning is related to the transition from the `index_together` option in Django model `Meta` classes to the `indexes` option. The `index_together` option was deprecated in favor of the `indexes` option, which is more flexible and powerful.

In the context of the provided code snippets, the migration operations should be updated to ensure any existing usage of `index_together` is transitioned seamlessly to `indexes`. 

This involves:
1. Detecting instances where `index_together` is still being used.
2. Translating those instances into the new `indexes` format during forward migrations.
3. Ensuring that backward migrations are also updated to handle the transition properly.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`**:
    - **Modify `AlterTogetherOptionOperation` class**:
        - In the `state_forwards` method, add logic to translate `index_together` into the appropriate `indexes` format.
        - In the `database_forwards` method, update any `index_together` references to be represented using `indexes`. Ensure this maintains backward compatibility by also updating the `database_backwards` method.
    - **Modify `RenameField` class**:
        - Ensure `index_together` is updated to `indexes` format during field renaming.
    - **Modify `CreateModel` class**:
        - Translate any `index_together` option into the `indexes` format when creating new models.
2. **File `django/db/models/indexes.py`**:
    - Ensure that the `create_sql` method can handle the transition from `index_together` to `indexes`.
3. **File `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`**:
    - Ensure the migration recorder class is correctly recording the new format for indexes in relation to squashed migrations.

By following these changes, the deprecation warnings resulting from the use of `index_together` should be eliminated, ensuring compatibility and clean upgrades to Django 4.2 without manual rewrites of migrations. This approach maintains backward compatibility and ensures migrations are handled correctly during both forward and backward operations.

Finally, review the migration operations to ensure they are correctly squashing and handling all instances of `index_together` to `indexes` during the squashing process itself.

These changes will be confined to the specified file, ensuring minimal disruption to the codebase while addressing the deprecation warnings effectively.
