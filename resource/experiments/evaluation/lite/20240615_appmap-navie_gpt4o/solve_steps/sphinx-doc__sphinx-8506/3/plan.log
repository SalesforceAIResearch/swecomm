**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**
This is a description of the problem that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused ond describing the problem fully as a software Issue, aka Ticket.


The problem statement will be prefixed with "[problem-statement]"
1ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

Focus the plan on modifying exactly one file.

Do not modify test case files. Test case files are those that include "test", "tests" in their paths,

Sphinx 3.2 complains about option:: syntax that earlier versions accepted
Sphinx 3.2 complains about use of the option:: directive that earlier versions accepted without complaint.

The QEMU documentation includes this:
```
.. option:: [enable=]PATTERN

   Immediately enable events matching *PATTERN*
```

as part of the documentation of the command line options of one of its programs. Earlier versions of Sphinx were fine with this, but Sphinx 3.2 complains:

```
Warning, treated as error:
../../docs/qemu-option-trace.rst.inc:4:Malformed option description '[enable=]PATTERN', should look like "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", "/opt args" or "+opt args"
```

Sphinx ideally shouldn't change in ways that break the building of documentation that worked in older versions, b... (1203)
