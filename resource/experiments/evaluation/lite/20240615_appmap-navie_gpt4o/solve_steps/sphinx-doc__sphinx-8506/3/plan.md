**Title**: Update `option` directive in Sphinx to accept more flexible option formats

**Problem**: 
Sphinx 3.2 has introduced a stricter syntax check for option directives, which is causing existing documentation that previously built without issues to now fail. The specific issue is with the `option::` directive, where the new version expects a very limited set of option formats (e.g., "opt", "-opt args", "--opt args", "/opt args", "+opt args"). This breaks compatibility with documentation that uses different or more flexible option formats, such as `[enable=]PATTERN`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is that Sphinx 3.2 has implemented more restrictive validation on option directive syntax. This stricter validation does not account for the variety of option formats that might be used by different programs and operating systems, leading to the error when the documentation includes non-standard option formats.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the part of Sphinx where the option directive syntax is validated. By loosening the restriction to allow any string as a valid option format, we can ensure backward compatibility and flexibility for documenting different command-line interfaces.

**Proposed Changes**:
The changes should be made to the file where the option directive's arguments are parsed and validated. Based on the selected code snippets, the file `sphinx/directives/code.py` contains the `CodeBlock` directive, and similar directives may have syntax-check logic that needs adjusting.

1. **sphinx/directives/code.py**: Locate the validation logic for option directives and modify it to accept more flexible formats for options. 

   - **Update the syntax validation logic**: Change the regular expression or validation function that checks the option format to be more lenient. Instead of a restrictive list, allow any string so that unusual or custom options formats are not rejected.

Here are the modifications in detail:

- Modify the function or method that handles the parsing of the `option` directive. Make sure it accepts any string format by either removing the strict validation or updating the regular expression used for validation to be more inclusive.

- Ensure this change does not impact other functionalities or cause regressions by reviewing related code and updating validations accordingly.

   Note that this level of change should be carefully tested to ensure other aspects of Sphinx's functionality are not adversely affected.

By making these changes, we ensure that Sphinx can build documentation that includes a wider variety of option formats, maintaining backward compatibility and flexibility for different documentation requirements.
