### Title:
Relax Syntax Validation for `option::` Directive in Sphinx 3.2

### Problem:
In Sphinx 3.2, the `option::` directive has become more restrictive, leading to errors when using certain option syntaxes that were previously allowed. Specifically, `option:: [enable=]PATTERN` results in a "Malformed option description" error. This breaks documentation builds that worked with earlier versions and limits support for varied option syntaxes used by different programs and OSes.

### Analysis:
The root of the issue is the enhanced validation logic for the `option::` directive in Sphinx 3.2. The directive now strictly checks against a predefined set of acceptable option formats. This change inadvertently introduces incompatibility for documentation that specifies command line options in formats not included in this list.

To resolve this, we should allow the `option::` directive to accept any string pattern. By doing this, we will cater to diverse option styles and maintain backwards compatibility with older Sphinx versions.

### Proposed Changes:
1. **File: `sphinx/domains/rst.py`**
   - Modify the `ReSTDirectiveOption` class by adjusting its signature handling method. Specifically, relax the pattern-matching conditions that trigger the "Malformed option description" error.

#### Detailed Changes:
- **`sphinx/domains/rst.py`**
  - Locate the `ReSTDirectiveOption` class within the file.
  - Identify the `handle_signature` method that processes the directive signatures.
  - Update this method to perform less restrictive validation, allowing any string as a valid option description.

### Steps:
1. Open `sphinx/domains/rst.py`.
2. Find the `ReSTDirectiveOption` class definition.
3. Locate the `handle_signature` method within this class.
4. Modify the method to accept any string pattern for option descriptions, removing or adjusting the current restrictive checks.

By implementing these changes, the `option::` directive will accept a broader range of option descriptions, including those previously allowed by earlier Sphinx versions. This ensures broader compatibility and flexibility in documenting command-line interfaces.
