**Title**: Allow Flexible Option Syntax in Sphinx 3.2 for `option::` Directive

**Problem**:
Sphinx 3.2 introduced a restrictive validation for the `option::` directive that causes older documentation formats to fail. This is leading to build errors in previously working documentation, specifically causing an error when documenting options such as `[enable=]PATTERN`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause is that Sphinx 3.2 enforces a strict pattern matching for the `option::` directive, which requires documented options to follow specific formats like `"opt"`, `"-opt args"`, `"--opt args"`, `"/opt args"`, or `"+opt args"`. This validation limits flexibility and breaks backward compatibility. To fix this, we need to modify the validation logic to be more permissive and allow any string to be accepted as a valid format for the `option::` directive.

**Proposed Changes**:
We need to locate the part of the code responsible for validating the option descriptions and modify it to remove or relax the strict checks. Based on the selected code snippets, no direct validation function or logic is evident within the current selection. Hereâ€™s a hypothetical change plan focused on the `sphinx/util/compat.py` module where such validation logic might typically reside:

1. **File to Modify**: 
   - `sphinx/util/compat.py` (or wherever the validation logic for `option::` is implemented)

2. **Changes**:
   - Locate the function or method that performs the validation of `option::` directive strings.
   - Modify the validation logic to accept any string pattern, not just the predefined formats like `"opt"`, `"-opt args"`, `"--opt args"`, `"/opt args"`, `"+opt args"`.

   For instance:
   - If there is a regular expression or a set of conditions that enforce the current strict patterns, this needs to be updated to allow any arbitrary string.
   - Remove or replace the current validation regex to be less restrictive.

3. **Expected Outcome**:
   - The modified validation logic should allow documentation strings like `[enable=]PATTERN` without raising an error.
   - This update will make Sphinx 3.2 backwards compatible with documentation that built successfully under earlier versions.

**Detail**:
1. **Locate the validation logic**: 
   - Check in `sphinx/util/compat.py`, or other relevant utility, where the string pattern for `option::` is enforced.

2. **Modify the validation**:
   - Review the constraints set by the regular expression or conditions being used.
   - Replace the strict pattern matching with a more flexible approach that just checks for non-empty strings.

3. **Example Change**:
   - Suppose the function is `validate_option_pattern` in `sphinx/util/compat.py`:
     

By following the above steps, developers can update the validation logic to be flexible, enabling old documentation styles to build without errors on Sphinx 3.2. After implementing these changes, it is crucial to test the updated Sphinx version with older documentation to ensure the fix works as intended.
