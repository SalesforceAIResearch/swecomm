**Title**: Fix type inconsistency in TextChoices/IntegerChoices fields to return string or integer values

**Problem**: When creating or retrieving an instance of a model that uses Django's `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices` for `CharField` or `IntegerField`, the value returned is an enum instance (`enum.Enum`) instead of the expected string or integer value. This inconsistency can cause unexpected issues, particularly when string or integer values are expected, such as when communicating with an external API.

**Analysis**: The root cause of this issue is that Django's `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices` enum classes directly use enum members, which are instances of `enum.Enum`, instead of their underlying values when accessing the field values. To address this, the getter method for the fields that use `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices` should be updated to return the underlying string or integer value instead of the enum instance.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/enums.py`
   - **Location**: Update the `Choices` base class to ensure it returns the enum value when accessed.
   - **Details**:
     - Override the `__str__` method in the `Choices` class, ensuring that it returns the `value` property of the enum instance.
     - Modify the accessor methods for `IntegerChoices` and `TextChoices` to ensure they return the `value` property instead of the enum instance directly.

2. **File**: `django/contrib/admin/filters.py`
   - While there might not be direct modifications here, verify that any filtering logic for model fields using `TextChoices` or `IntegerChoices` works seamlessly with the updated getter behavior.

**Detailed Modification Steps**:

1. **django/db/models/enums.py**:
   - Locate the `Choices` class definition.
   - Override the `__str__` method within `Choices` to return `self.value`.
   - Ensure any other relevant methods also return `self.value` instead of the enum instance directly within the `IntegerChoices` and `TextChoices` classes.

2. **Verification**:
   - Ensure that the modified code is compatible with other parts of the Django codebase (e.g., filters, forms).
   - Test the changes using an appropriate suite of unit tests that cover scenarios involving `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`.

By updating the getter methods for `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices` to return the underlying value, we address the inconsistency and ensure that model fields return the expected string or integer values rather than enum instances, preventing potential errors in various use cases.
