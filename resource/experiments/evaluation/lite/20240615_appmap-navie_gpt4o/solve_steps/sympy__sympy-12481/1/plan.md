**Title**: Allow `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles

**Problem**:
Calling `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` raises a `ValueError` instead of constructing the expected permutation. Non-disjoint cycles should be applied in left-to-right order, and the resulting permutation should be returned.

**Analysis**:
The `Permutation` constructor currently assumes that the cycles provided are disjoint. This means if any element is repeated across multiple cycles, a `ValueError` is raised. However, in principle, applying non-disjoint cycles in sequence should create a valid permutation.

We need to modify the constructor logic to concatenate the actions of the cycles in order, rather than checking for disjointness. This requires updating the array form of the permutation based on the iterative application of each cycle.

**Proposed Changes**:

*File: `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`*

1. **Modify the `Permutation` constructor**:
   - Add logic to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying cycles iteratively.
   - Ensure that the resulting permutation is computed by the left-to-right application of the cycles.

2. **Update the internal cycle handling logic**:
   - Iterate over each cycle and apply it to the permutation array.
   - Generate the final permutation based on the cumulative effect of all cycles.
   - Ensure no exceptions are raised for non-disjoint cycles.

**Detailed Changes**:

- **Function**: `__init__` or relevant constructor equivalent for `Permutation`.
   - Initialize an identity permutation array based on the degree.
   - For each cycle provided, update the identity permutation array by applying the cycle.
   - If an element is already visited in the current cycle, continue updating without raising an error.
   - Finalize the permutation object using the updated array.

This change ensures that the `Permutation` constructor can handle non-disjoint cycles and computes the resulting permutation correctly.
