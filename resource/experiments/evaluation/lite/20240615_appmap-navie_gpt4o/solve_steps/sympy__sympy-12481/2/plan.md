**Title**

Fix `Permutation` constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles without raising ValueError

**Problem**

The `Permutation` constructor currently raises a `ValueError` when it is called with non-disjoint cycles. Instead of raising an error, the constructor should process the cycles in left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation.

**Analysis**

The roots of this problem lie in the constructor of the `Permutation` class, which is not properly handling non-disjoint cycles. Non-disjoint cycles are cyclic subgroups that share elements, and their operations should be applied sequentially rather than in isolation. The correct behavior for the constructor should be to apply each cycle in sequence (from left-to-right) and compute the resultant permutation.

To solve this problem, we need to modify the logic in the `Permutation` constructor to:

1. Allow non-disjoint cycles.
2. Apply cycles in left-to-right order to produce the resultant permutation.
3. Ensure the resultant permutation is returned without errors.

**Proposed Changes**

The changes should be applied to the constructor or relevant method in the `Permutation` class. The exact implementation will depend on the internal structure of the class, but the steps are generally:

1. Identify the part of the code where the `ValueError` is being raised for non-disjoint cycles.
2. Modify the logic to handle non-disjoint cycles:
   - Initialize the result permutation as an identity permutation of the appropriate length.
   - Iterate through each cycle.
   - For each cycle, update the result permutation by applying the cycle to it.
3. Ensure that the resulting permutation is correctly computed and returned.

**Detailed Description of Changes**

* **File**: `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`
  * **Function**: `__init__` (or relevant constructor method)
  * **Changes**:
    - Locate the block where the constructor checks for disjoint cycles and raises the `ValueError`.
    - Replace this block with a mechanism to sequentially apply each cycle to an initial identity permutation.
    - Ensure the cycles are applied in left-to-right order and that the final permutation reflects these applications.
    - Remove or modify the logic that raises the `ValueError` to allow processing non-disjoint cycles.
  
By making these changes, the `Permutation` constructor will be able to handle non-disjoint cycles as described and will return a valid permutation without raising an error.

This should be the only file requiring modification, and the changes should be contained within the appropriate method of the `Permutation` class.
