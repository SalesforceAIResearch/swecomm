**Title**: Implement MathML printer for `Indexed` objects in Sympy

**Problem**: 
Writing an `Indexed` object to MathML fails with a `TypeError` exception: `TypeError: 'Indexed' object is not iterable`. This occurs when trying to convert expressions involving `Indexed` objects into MathML format.

**Analysis**:
The problem arises because the current MathML printer does not have specific handling for `Indexed` objects. The function `_print_Basic` uses a generic approach to traverse the arguments of objects under the assumption they are iterable. However, `Indexed` objects in Sympy are not directly iterable, resulting in the `TypeError`. The solution involves adding a printing method specifically for handling `Indexed` objects, which will correctly parse and convert them into MathML format. It should include the base and indices of the `Indexed` object.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/mathml.py`
    - Method: Define a new `_print_Indexed` method in the `MathMLContentPrinter` or `MathMLPresentationPrinter`.

   **Details**:
   - Implement `_print_Indexed` within the appropriate printer class (`MathMLContentPrinter` or `MathMLPresentationPrinter`).
   - In the `_print_Indexed` method, create an XML element that properly represents the base and indices of the `Indexed` object.
   - Append the required child elements and handle the formatting for both content and presentation MathML.
   
Example of steps:
   
   - Retrieve the base name of the indexed object.
   - For each index, use the `_print` method to convert it to the corresponding MathML representation and append it to the parent element.
   - Handle the specific MathML tags and structure required for both content and presentation math as needed.

   **Specific changes**:
   - Add the `_print_Indexed` method that correctly interprets the structure of `Indexed` objects.
   - Ensure the new method integrates seamlessly with the existing MathML printing logic to handle both `MathMLContentPrinter` and `MathMLPresentationPrinter`.

**Implementation Outline**:
   

2. Ensure this new method is in the correct printer class and call it appropriately within the `mathml` or `print_mathml` methods.

By implementing these changes, the MathML printer should be able to handle `Indexed` objects without raising a `TypeError` and correctly produce the desired MathML output for such expressions.
