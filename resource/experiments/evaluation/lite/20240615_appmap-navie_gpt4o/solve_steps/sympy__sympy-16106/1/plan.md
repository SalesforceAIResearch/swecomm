**Title**: Implement MathML Printing for IndexedBase Objects

**Problem**: Attempting to print a MathML representation of an `IndexedBase` object results in a `TypeError` due to the object being non-iterable, causing the current MathML printer to fail.

**Analysis**: The root cause of this issue lies in the fact that the current MathML printer does not have specific handling for `IndexedBase` and `Indexed` objects, treating them as if they were iterables, which they are not. To fix this, we need to implement dedicated printer methods to correctly generate MathML elements for these objects.

The `IndexedBase` and `Indexed` objects require custom handling where `IndexedBase` represents a base identifier and `Indexed` represents an indexed expression that combines the base with its indices. The printer should generate appropriate MathML tags to represent these components accurately.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/mathml.py`
   
   **1.1 Add new method `_print_IndexedBase`:**
   - Create a method `_print_IndexedBase` that generates MathML for the base of the indexed expression. This method should utilize the appropriate MathML tags for identifiers (`<ci>`).

   **1.2 Add new method `_print_Indexed`:**
   - Create a method `_print_Indexed` that generates MathML for an `Indexed` object. This method should first print the base using `_print_IndexedBase` and then generate MathML for each of its indices using the appropriate tags (`<ci>` or `<mn>`).

For example (detailed steps without specific code):
- Define the structure to encapsulate the base and indices into a correct MathML `<apply>` context.
- Ensure the base uses `<ci>` and indices are appended to it correctly.

2. **File Modification Locations**:

   **sympy/printing/mathml.py**:
   
   - **Add `_print_IndexedBase` method**:
     - Responsible for printing an `IndexedBase` object correctly in MathML format.
   
   - **Add `_print_Indexed` method**:
     - Responsible for printing an `Indexed` object correctly in MathML format.
     - Calls the `_print_IndexedBase` for the base and iterates over the indices to generate their MathML representations, then combines these appropriately within `<apply>` tags.

- **Modify method dispatching**:
    - Update the main printer method to recognize `Indexed` and `IndexedBase` objects and route them to their respective printing methods.

By implementing these targeted changes, we ensure that `IndexedBase` and `Indexed` objects are handled correctly when printing MathML, resolving the `TypeError` and allowing complex expressions with indexed components to be converted to MathML without errors.
