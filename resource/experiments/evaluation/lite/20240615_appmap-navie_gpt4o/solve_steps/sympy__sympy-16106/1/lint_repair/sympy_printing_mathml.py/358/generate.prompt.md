## Objective

Fix the linter errors indicated by the <lint-errors> tag.

The <diff> section contains the current diff between the work-in-progress file and the
current committed version. You can use this to understand the context of the lint errors,
and possibly to restore or repair code that was improperly removed or changed.

The <file> section contains the current content of the file. It contains line numbers
to help you identify the lines that have the lint errors. Do not emit the line numbers
in your solution.

## Instructions

Fix the lint errors by:

* Modifying the line. Example: Fixing syntax.
* Adding other lines that make the line valid. Example: Adding required imports.
* Adjusting leading whitespace. Example: Fixing indentation in Python. 

Don't fix the lint errors by removing the line that has the error. The line that
has the error is important, but it needs to be fixed.

If the lint error is related to an undefined symbol, do your best to import 
the symbol from the correct module.

## Output format


For each change you want to make, generate a pair of tags called <original> and <modified>.

Wrap these tags with a <change> tag that also includes a <file> tag with the file path.

The <original> tag should contain the original code that you want to change. Do not abbreviate
existing code using ellipses or similar.

The code in the <original> tag must match the original code exactly. Any changes from the original
code belong in the <modified> tag.

Always include an attribute "no-ellipsis" with the value "true" in the <original> tag.
This should be a true statement about the tag.

The <original> code should contain an attribute that indicates about how many lines of context
it contains. You should plan for this context to contain the code that should be modified, plus
three lines before and after it.

Do not output the entire original code, or long functions, if you only want to change a part of it.
Plan to output only the part that you want to change.

If you need to make multiple changes to the same file, output multiple <change> tags.
In the change, indicate the number of the change that this is, starting from 1.

The <modified> tag should contain the modified code that you want to replace the original code with.
Do not abbreviate the modified code using ellipses or similar. You must place the exact modified code
in the <modified> tag.

You do not need to output the entire modified code if you only want to change a part of it. Output
only the part that you want to change.

Always include an attribute "no-ellipsis" with the value "true" in the <modified> tag.
This should be a true statement about the tag.

Both the original code and the output code must contain the proper indentation and formatting.
For example, if the original code has 4 spaces of indentation, the output code must also have 4
spaces of indentation. If the original code has 8 spaces of indentation, the output code must also have
8 spaces of indentation.

The <original> and <modified> content should be wrapped in a CDATA section to avoid XML parsing issues.

## Example output

<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">src/myproj/myfunc.py</file>
<original line-count="14" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class DateTime(Field):
def bind_to_schema(self, field_name, schema):
    self.field_name = field_name
    self.container = schema
    # Configure format from schema opts
    if self.format is None and hasattr(schema, "opts"):
        self.format = schema.opts.datetimeformat
        self.dateformat = schema.opts.dateformat
        self.metadata["marshmallow_field"] = self
    # _bind_to_schema is called before processors
    if hasattr(schema, "root"):
        self.root = schema.root
    if self.metadata.get("validate"):
        self._validate = self.metadata["validate"]
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
class DateTime(Field):
def bind_to_schema(self, field_name, schema):
    self.field_name = field_name
    self.container = schema
    # Check if 'schema' has 'opts' before accessing
    if hasattr(schema, "opts"):
        # Configure format from schema opts
        if self.format is None:
            self.format = schema.opts.datetimeformat
            self.dateformat = schema.opts.dateformat
        self.metadata["marshmallow_field"] = self
        # _bind_to_schema is called before processors
        if hasattr(schema, "root"):
            self.root = schema.root
        if self.metadata.get("validate"):
            self._validate = self.metadata["validate"]
]]></modified>
</change>
    

In the <original> and <modified> tags, do not emit line numbers. The line numbers are
only present in the file/content to help you identify which line has the lint error.
