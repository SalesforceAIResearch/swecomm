**Title**: Implement MathML Printer for IndexedBase

**Problem**:
Writing an `Indexed` object to MathML fails with a `TypeError` exception: `TypeError: 'Indexed' object is not iterable` when attempting to print the `IndexedBase`. This occurs due to the current `_print_Basic` method trying to iterate over the `Indexed` object, which is not iterable.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is that the `_print_Basic` method of the `MathMLContentPrinter` (and likely the `MathMLPresentationPrinter`) class presumes that all `Basic` objects are iterable. The specific case of handling `Indexed` objects is not covered, which leads to the `TypeError` exception.

To resolve this, a dedicated `_print_IndexedBase` method needs to be added to handle `Indexed` objects appropriately. This method will handle the `Indexed` structure and print it correctly in MathML format. 

**Proposed Changes**:
To address the issue with the `mathml` function printing `Indexed` objects, the following changes should be made within the `sympy/printing/mathml.py` file:

1. **Add a custom `_print_Indexed` method in `MathMLContentPrinter`**.
    - This method should correctly process the `Indexed` object by creating the relevant MathML elements.
    - Ensure the method handles both the base and indices of the `Indexed` object.

2. **Add a custom `_print_IndexedBase` method in `MathMLContentPrinter`**.
    - This method should handle just the base of the `Indexed` object.

**Detailed Changes for sympy/printing/mathml.py**:

1. **Update Class to Add _print_Indexed**:
    - In the `MathMLContentPrinter` class, implement the `_print_Indexed` method. This method should create an `<mrow>` element containing the indexed base and its indices in the MathML format. 

2. **Update Class to Add _print_IndexedBase**:
    - Similarly, implement the `_print_IndexedBase` method in the `MathMLContentPrinter` class. This method only needs to handle the base part and ensure it is wrapped correctly in MathML tags.

**Example Change Descriptions**:

- **Function `_print_Indexed`**:
    1. Create a basic `<mrow>` element for wrapping the indexed expression.
    2. Append the printed base (using `_print`) to the `<mrow>` element.
    3. Iterate over the indices of the `Indexed` object, printing each and appending to the `<mrow>`.

- **Function `_print_IndexedBase`**:
    1. Create a MathML element corresponding to the base of the `Indexed` object.
    2. Ensure itâ€™s formatted correctly as per MathML standards.

By implementing these changes, you ensure that `Indexed` expressions can be translated into MathML without causing type errors, enabling better mathematical expression handling in SymPy.
