**Title**: Fix Self-Referencing Foreign Key Ordering Issue

**Problem**: 
When ordering Django querysets by a self-referencing foreign key, the ordering is incorrect due to an unexpected descending sort and unnecessary additional JOIN operations. This incorrect behavior is observed when the foreign key references the same model (self-referencing). The expected behavior is for the queryset's specified `order_by` to take precedence without the additional sort or JOIN operations.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises from the way Django's ORM handles ordering in the presence of self-referencing foreign keys. The default model ordering interferes with the explicitly specified `order_by` clause, causing the ORM to include unnecessary JOINs and affecting the sort direction.

In the problematic case, the queryset:

generates SQL with an unexpected descending sort due to the `ordering` attribute in `OneModel`. It also includes an additional JOIN because the ORM misinterprets the self-referencing relationship. 

A correct workaround is using the `annotate` method:

This approach provides the correct result with the expected ASCENDING sort and a single INNER JOIN.

**Proposed Changes**:
To resolve the issue and handle self-referencing foreign keys correctly, the changes need to be made in how the ORM constructs its queries when `order_by` is specified. Specifically, we need to ensure that the custom `order_by` clause takes precedence over the model's `ordering` attribute and prevents extraneous JOINs. 

Changes should be focused on the `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py` file where the query construction happens. 

1. **Modify the `add_update_values` method**:
   - Ensure that the addition of order fields respects the explicit `order_by` calls and ignores the model's default ordering when fields include self-referencing foreign keys.

   

2. **Refactor the query JOIN logic**:
   - Ensure that when building the JOIN conditionals, self-referencing foreign keys are treated correctly to avoid unnecessary JOINs.

   

3. **Override default ordering when explicitly specified**:
   - Implement a check where, if the `order_by` clause is provided, it should unequivocally override any existing ordering from the model's Meta class.

   

By implementing these changes, the queries should respect the explicit ordering without additional JOINs or unexpected sorts. 

Note: Test cases should also be evaluated post code changes to ensure that the described issue is resolved without introducing new bugs.

These changes should ideally handle not just the specific reported problem but also improve the robustness of query construction for related scenarios involving self-referencing keys within the ORM. 

---

To complete the issue: update the query construction and order application methods in `django/db/models/sql/subqueries.py` to correctly prioritize explicit `order_by` clauses and handle self-referencing foreign keys without adding redundant JOINs or incorrect sort orders.
