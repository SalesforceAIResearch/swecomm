**Title**: Fix Incorrect SQL Query Ordering and Joins with Self-Referencing Foreign Keys

**Problem**:
When creating querysets with `order_by("record__root_id")`, Django generates unexpected SQL queries, with an incorrect `ORDER BY` clause and unnecessary joins. This issue arises with models having self-referencing foreign keys, leading to unexpected descending order and additional JOIN clauses.

**Analysis**:
The problem manifests because Django's query planning doesn't seamlessly handle cases where models have self-referencing foreign keys, specifically when ordering by these fields. The query planner defaults to the model's Meta ordering attribute and generates redundant SQL joins, introducing inefficiencies and incorrect orderings.

1. **Root Cause**: 
   - The `order_by` clause in the queryset is being overridden by the model's Meta `ordering` attribute, leading to incorrect order direction.
   - The presence of self-referencing foreign keys causes the query planner to generate unnecessary SQL joins, which degrades performance.

2. **Effects**: 
   - Incorrect ordering in the resulting SQL query.
   - Presence of redundant JOIN clauses in the SQL query.

3. **Requirement**: 
   - Ensure that when `order_by("record__root_id")` or similar clauses are invoked, the queryset appropriately prioritizes the `order_by` arguments over the model's Meta ordering.
   - Streamline the query to eliminate redundant JOIN clauses, ensuring logical consistency and optimal query performance.

**Proposed Changes**:

**File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`

1.  **Modify Function: `add_ordering`**:
    - This function is responsible for adding the ordering clauses to the SQL compilation.
    - Ensure that any explicit `order_by` clause passed in the queryset takes precedence over the modelâ€™s Meta ordering attribute.
    - Adjust the handling of `OrderBy` clauses to prevent self-referencing foreign keys from generating redundant joins.

    **Implementation Details**:
    - Detect when a `self-referencing` foreign key is involved in the `order_by` clause.
    - Override the ordering direction specified by the model's Meta with the direction provided in the `order_by` clause.
    - Ensure that only necessary JOIN clauses are added to the query.

2. **Improve Logic in `get_ordering`**:
    - Enhance logic in `get_ordering` function to intelligently handle self-referential foreign key fields.
    - Add checks to avoid double JOINs for these fields.

3. **Revise JOIN Clause Compilation**:
    - While joining tables, inspect if a self-reference and eliminate unnecessary JOINs
    - Ensure the SQL server is instructed to follow the defined order explicitly eliminating unintended discrepancies.

**File**: `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py`

1. **Modify SQL Compiler Methods**:
    - Adjust methods involving SQL compilation to incorporate the required JOIN and ordering logic adjustments.
    - Ensure explicit order directives from querysets take precedence, even with the involvement of self-referencing foreign keys.

    - Refactor `as_sql` function to handle `F` expressions and similar constructs more adeptly, avoiding redundant JOIN instructions.

By focusing the proposed changes on the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and `django/db/models/sql/compiler.py` files, we can ensure that the solution properly addresses the root causes of the issue with minimal disruption to other parts of the codebase. This will result in correct SQL query generation, improved performance, and accurate results in querysets with self-referencing foreign keys.
