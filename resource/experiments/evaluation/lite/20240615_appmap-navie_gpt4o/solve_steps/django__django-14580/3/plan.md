**Title**: Add missing 'models' import statement in Django migration writer

**Problem**:
When running the `makemigrations` command, Django generates a migration file that omits the necessary import for `models`, causing a `NameError`. This error occurs whenever a migration file references `models` without importing it.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this problem resides in the Django migration writer module (`django/db/migrations/writer.py`). The `MigrationWriter` does not automatically include the necessary import statement for `models` even when `models` is referenced in the migration file. This leads to a `NameError` when trying to use models in the file.

The solution involves modifying the `MigrationWriter` class to ensure that `models` is included in the import statements whenever any model is referenced in the migration operations.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/writer.py`
   - **Section 1**: Modify the `MigrationWriter` class to ensure that any time `models` is referenced in the operations, the import statement for `models` is included.
   - **Section 2**: Update the `OperationWriter` to add `models` to the set of imports when it serializes operations that involve models.

Detailed changes:

- **Modification to `MigrationWriter` constructor**:
  - Ensure `models` is added to the imports if any operation contains references to `models`.

- **Update to `OperationWriter.serialize` Method**:
  - Inspect the serialized operations for any reference to `models` and add an import if found.

Changes to be made in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`:

1. **Update the `MigrationWriter.as_string` method**:
   - After deconstructing operations and collecting imports, check if any of the operations or bases contain `models.Model`.
   - If found, add `from django.db import models` to the imports set.

Existing function signature for reference (`django/db/migrations/writer.py` around line 130):

Proposed modification:
- Identify if `models.Model` or any custom models are referenced within the operations, and ensure `from django.db import models` is added to the imports set.



With these changes, the generated migration file will correctly include the required import statements, thus preventing the `NameError` from occurring.
