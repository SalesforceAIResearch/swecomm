**Title**: Fix missing `models` import in generated migration files

**Problem**: 
Django's `makemigrations` command generates migration files that miss the `models` import statement when custom field types or mixin classes are defined outside the standard `models` module. This results in a `NameError: name 'models' is not defined` during the migration.

**Analysis**: 
The issue stems from how the migration writer constructs the import statements in the generated migration files. Specifically, the writer fails to recognize the need to include `models` in the import statements when additional classes (such as custom fields or mixins) from other modules are present.

In the provided migration file example, the class bases `app.models.MyMixin` and `models.Model` are referenced, but only `app.models` is imported:

However, since `models` is used in the bases, it should also be imported:


**Proposed Changes**: 
Focus the solution on modifying the writer module to ensure that `models` is always included when necessary. Based on the provided code snippets, the most relevant file to change is:

- `django/db/migrations/writer.py`

The required change should ensure that the `models` import statement is always added if `models.Model` or any other `models` entities are referenced in the generated migration.

1. **`django/db/migrations/writer.py`**:
   - **Change Description**: Inspect the logic that generates import statements. Ensure it adds `from django.db import models` whenever `models` is referenced in either fields or bases.
   - **Detailed Modifications**:
     1. Locate the method responsible for writing imports, possibly `write_imports`.
     2. Update this method to include an additional check to identify if any class bases or field types reference `models.Model` or other `models` entities.
     3. Ensure that if such references are detected, the statement `from django.db import models` is added to the top of the migration file.

Ensure that the solution does not interfere with existing functionality and properly scopes the imports only to the necessary migrations.

These changes should resolve the error by ensuring all necessary modules, including `models`, are imported, making the migration file syntactically valid.
