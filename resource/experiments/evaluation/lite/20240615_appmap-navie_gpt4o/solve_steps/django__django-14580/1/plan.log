**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Missing import statement in generated migration (NameError: name 'models' is not defined)
Description
	
I found a bug in Django's latest release: 3.2.4. 
Given the following contents of models.py:
from django.db import models
class MyField(models.TextField):
	pass
class MyBaseModel(models.Model):
	class Meta:
		abstract = True
class MyMixin:
	pass
class MyModel(MyMixin, MyBaseModel):
	name = MyField(primary_key=True)
The makemigrations command will generate the following migration file:
# Generated by Django 3.2.4 on 2021-06-30 19:13
import app.models
from django.db import migrations
class Migration(migrations.Migration):
	initial = True
	dependencies = [

	operations = [
		migrations.CreateModel(
