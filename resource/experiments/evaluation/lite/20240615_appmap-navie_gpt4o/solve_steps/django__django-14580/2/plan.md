**Title**: Add missing import statement for 'models' in generated migration files

**Problem**: When the `makemigrations` command is executed, the created migration file does not include an import statement for `models`, leading to a `NameError` when running migrations. The specific error is `NameError: name 'models' is not defined`.

**Analysis**:

The issue arises because the migration generation process does not ensure that `models` from `django.db` is imported when creating the migration file. Specifically, when `models.Model` is used in the `bases` parameter of the `CreateModel` operation but `models` is not explicitly imported, it results in a missing import. 

The problem indeed seems to be within the migration writer implementation, as it is responsible for generating and serializing the migration operations, including handling the necessary imports.

To solve this issue, we need to ensure that the `models` module is imported if it is referenced in the migration file. This requires checking for references to `models` in the `CreateModel` operation and including the import statement if such references are found.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/writer.py`
   
   **Changes**:
   
   - In the `MigrationWriter` class, extend the logic that collects import statements to ensure `models` from `django.db` is included if any of the operations reference it.

   - Modify the `OperationWriter` class, or the part of `MigrationWriter` that handles the serialization of operations, to check for `models.Model` in the `bases` or any other parameters and ensure that `from django.db import models` is added to the imports if necessary.

2. **Details**:
  
   - Locate the part in `MigrationWriter.as_string` method where the import statements are collected and ensure that `from django.db import models` is added if the operations reference `models.Model`.

   - Locate the part in `OperationWriter.serialize` method where the `bases` parameter of `CreateModel` is handled, and ensure that any reference to `models.Model` triggers an inclusion of `from django.db import models` in the final migration file.

3. **Implementation**:
   
   - Update `MigrationWriter` to detect if `models.Model` or any custom fields based on `models` are used. If so, include `from django.db import models` in the imports section of the generated migration file.

   - Ensure that this logic is applied during the serialize step of the migration writing process.

Here is a detailed description of the necessary changes in `django/db/migrations/writer.py`:

- In the `MigrationWriter` class, within the `as_string()` method, after deconstructing operations and collecting imports, add logic to include `from django.db import models` if any operation references it.

- In the `OperationWriter` class, within the `serialize()` method, inspect `bases`, `fields`, and other parameters for mentions of `models` and add `from django.db import models` to the import statements if required.

These changes will ensure that the generated migration files are valid Python scripts, having all necessary import statements to avoid `NameError` during execution.
