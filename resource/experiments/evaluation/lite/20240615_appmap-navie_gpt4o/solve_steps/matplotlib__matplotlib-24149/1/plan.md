### Title:
Fix `ax.bar` to Handle All-NaN Data Without Raising Exceptions

### Problem:
The `ax.bar` method in Matplotlib version 3.6.1 raises an exception when it is given arrays containing only `nan` values. Instead of gracefully handling this scenario, the function currently fails, which disrupts functionalities relying on it, such as Seaborn's histogram function.

### Analysis:
The root cause of the problem lies in the function `_safe_first_finite` within the `cbook` module and how `ax.bar` uses it for the conversion of x-coordinates. When all elements are `nan`, the `_safe_first_finite` function terminates with a `StopIteration` because it cannot find any finite values. This occurs specifically at the point when `_convert_dx` calls `_safe_first_finite` on the `x` list.

To resolve this, `_safe_first_finite` must be modified to be more robust in the face of all-`nan` data.

### Proposed Changes:
#### File to be changed:
- `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`

#### Function to be modified:
- `_safe_first_finite`

#### Detailed Changes:
1. **Add a check for all-`nan` data in `_safe_first_finite`.**
   - Modify `_safe_first_finite` to handle the case where no finite values are found in the input. Rather than allowing the function to result in a `StopIteration`, it should instead return `nan` indicating that all values are non-finite.

### Steps:
1. **Edit `_safe_first_finite` in `lib/matplotlib/cbook/__init__.py`:**
   - Add logic to check if all values are `nan` and handle it by returning `nan` instead of propagating a `StopIteration` exception.

Here's a conceptual outline of the logic to be added:
- Try iterating to find the first finite value as usual.
- If the iteration completes without finding a finite value (i.e., it raises `StopIteration`), then return `np.nan` (or another suitable value that signifies all values are non-finite).

The change ensures that functions like `ax.bar`, which rely on `_safe_first_finite`, can gracefully handle lists of `nan` values without raising exceptions, aligning the behavior with earlier Matplotlib versions where this worked seamlessly.

### Conclusion:
These adjustments should ensure that `ax.bar` operates smoothly when provided with `nan` values, maintaining the expected behavior and compatibility across different Matplotlib versions. This solution will fix the reported bug and provide resilience to similar input issues.
