**Title**: Fix "string index out of range" exception in `numberformat.py` when the number is null

**Problem**: 
A `string index out of range` exception occurs in `numberformat.py` when formatting a null number field for the admin `list_display`. This happens because `str_number[0]` is accessed without first checking if `str_number` is empty, leading to an `IndexError`.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue is that the code assumes `str_number` is always non-empty. However, when a number field in the admin `list_display` is null, `str_number` can be an empty string, causing an `IndexError` when `str_number[0]` is accessed.

To resolve this issue, we need to add a check to ensure `str_number` is not empty before accessing its first character. This will prevent the `IndexError` and handle the null case gracefully.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/utils/numberformat.py`

   - **Modify function**: Function within the selected code will be modified to handle cases where `str_number` is empty or null.
   
   - **Logic**:
     - Before accessing `str_number[0]`, add a check to ensure `str_number` is not empty.
     - If `str_number` is empty, this will handle the case gracefully without throwing an exception.

   **Detailed Changes**:
   - Add a condition to check if `str_number` is non-empty before accessing `str_number[0]`.

   - At the first occurrence (covered by your code selection):
     - Within the block of code:
       
       - Add a check:
         

   - At the second occurrence (covered by your code selection):
     - Within the block of code:
       
       - Add a check:
         

These changes will ensure that the `str_number` is checked for being non-empty before accessing its first character, thereby avoiding the `IndexError` when the number field is null.
