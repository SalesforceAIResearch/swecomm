**Title**: Prevent "string index out of range" error in numberformat.py when encountering null field

**Problem**: 

An `IndexError: string index out of range` is raised when the number formatting logic in `numberformat.py` encounters a `null` field. This occurs specifically in the line `if str_number[0] == "-"` when the variable `str_number` is an empty string.

**Analysis**:

When the `number` being formatted is `null`, converting it to a string and attempting to access its first character results in an empty string. Attempting to access `str_number[0]` then causes an `IndexError` because there is no character at the 0th position in an empty string. 

To resolve this issue, we need to add an additional check to ensure the string is not empty before attempting to access its first character. This check should be integrated in the logical block where the script evaluates the sign of the string representation of the number.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. Modify the `numberformat.py` file where the conversion and operation on `str_number` take place.
2. Implement a check to ensure `str_number` is not empty before accessing its first character.

**File**: `django/utils/numberformat.py`

1. **Location**: Update code immediately before `if str_number[0] == "-":` to handle empty strings.

   **Changes**:
   - Ensure `str_number` is not an empty string before checking its first character:
     - Add a condition to check if `str_number` is not empty.
     - Only proceed with subsequent sign detection logic if `str_number` is non-empty.
     - Assign a default value or handle the case appropriately if `str_number` is empty.
   
2. **Code Change**: 
   - Insert a conditional check for empty `str_number` before accessing its first character:
   - Modify around line 71 or pertinent location where the error is reported.

   

3. **Detailed Change Description**:
   - Identify where `str_number` is used.
   - Ensure safety checks are in place before accessing `str_number[0]`.
   - Modify any conditional logic that assumes `str_number` is always non-empty.

Make these modifications to ensure the code behaves correctly when `str_number` is an empty string, thus preventing the `IndexError`.
