### Title
Fix Issue Where Simplified Expression of `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1` is Inequivalent

### Problem
The function `simplify` in Sympy produces different outputs for the expression `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1` depending on the value of `x`. This issue is observed when substituting `x` with a specific value and then simplifying the expression using `simplify`, leading to inequivalent results.

### Analysis
The issue arises because the function `simplify` is transforming `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1` into an alternative form, `12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x)`. However, these two forms do not yield the same values under evaluation, especially when substituting non-integer values for `x` and then converting to numeric form with `N()`. The discrepancy surfaces because the complex plane and negative bases raise fractional exponents in a non-trivial manner causing conversion issues.

From the context of `simplify.py`, the critical parts of the simplification logic might include the rewriting of expressions involving powers and logarithms, as this transformation includes raising powers with fractional bases.

### Proposed Changes
Target the `simplify` function responsible for the transformation; the most probable functions involved are located in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`.

1. **Modify `simplify` Function**:
    - File: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`
    - Inspect the logic in `simplify` where the given expression is transformed.
    - Ensure the transformation conservatively preserves equivalence, especially ensuring careful handling of fractional and complex exponents.
    - Update the transformation rule, specifically `12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x)`, to maintain equivalence with the original expression.

2. **Adjust Simplification Logic for Exponents**:
    - File: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`
    - Track down the part of the code applying power rules and fractional base simplifications.
    - Add conditions to prevent incorrect simplification when dealing with negative bases and fractional exponents.
   
Here's where you should look to make changes:

#### Function: `simplify`

- **File**: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`
  - Identify the section that performs key transformations.
  - Introduce checks to maintain value equivalence, particularly when fractional and complex exponents are involved.

### Modification Example:
Without showing specific code, focus on these logical areas:

1. **Line around Simplification of Pow**:
   - Ensure that when simplifying powers, negative and fractional bases are handled judiciously.
   - Add checks to prevent simplifications that alter the value, especially for expressions like `(-base)**exp`.

### Conclusion
By refining the simplification steps, particularly for the transformation of the expression `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1`, we aim to preserve the equivalence of the original expression and its simplified form under various substitutions of `x`. This ensures that subsequent numeric evaluations like `N()` produce equivalent results.
