1ms [prompt] system: **Task: Generation of Code and Test Cases**

**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are code generation AI created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to generate code and test cases. Like a senior developer or architect, you have a deep understanding of the codebase.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the generated code and test cases. You can expect the user to be proficient
in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.


**Response Format**

Your solution must be provided as a series of code files and snippets that implement the desired functionality within the project 
code.... (1763)
1ms [prompt] system: **The code generation task**

This is a description of a code enhancement that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused primarily on solving this issue via code generation.


The issue description will be prefixed with "[issue-description]"
1ms [prompt] user: <issue-description>


Generate a list of all file names, module names, class names, function names and varable names that are mentioned in the
described issue. Do not emit symbols that are part of the programming language itself. Do not emit symbols that are part
of test frameworks. Focus on library and application code only. Emit the results as a JSON list. Do not emit text, markdown, 
or explanations.

(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1 simplifies to an inequivalent expression
    >>> from sympy import *
    >>> x = Symbol('x')
    >>> e = (-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1
    >>> e
    (-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1
    >>> f = simplify(e)
    >>> f
    12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x)
    >>> a = S(9)/5
    >>> simplify(e.subs(x,a))
