Let's address the issue described for the `simplify` function regarding the specific transformation of expressions involving fractional and complex exponents. We'll modify the `simplify` method to ensure it handles problematic transformations conservatively, preserving value equivalence.

My plan is to update the `simplify` function in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py` to add a check that prevents mis-simplifications when dealing with expressions like `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1`.

### Plan:
1. **Identify Simplification Logic:**
   - Locate the relevant section in the `simplify` function that applies transformations to expressions involving powers.
   
2. **Add Condition:**
   - Integrate checks to ensure the transformations maintain equivalence, particularly for expressions like `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x`.

### Change 1:
In the `simplify` function, after computing potential transformations, ensure that the transformations maintain equivalence before applying them.

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">sympy/simplify/simplify.py</file>
<original line-count="15" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
    short = shorter(powsimp(expr, combine='exp', deep=True), powsimp(expr), expr)
    short = shorter(short, cancel(short))
    short = shorter(short, factor_terms(short), expand_power_exp(expand_mul(short)))
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
    short = shorter(powsimp(expr, combine='exp', deep=True), powsimp(expr), expr)
    short = shorter(short, cancel(short))
    short = shorter(short, factor_terms(short), expand_power_exp(expand_mul(short)))
    
    # Ensure transformation maintains equivalence
    if expr == (expr ** 2).expand() ** Rational(1, 2):
        short = expr
]]></modified>
</change>
```

### Additional Tests:
Create a test in the testing suite to cover the mentioned transformation case.

### Change 2:
Add a test to ensure the discrepancy for negative bases and fractional exponents is handled.

```xml

```

### Conclusion:
The above changes should help ensure that the `simplify` function in SymPy preserves value equivalence when simplifying expressions like `(-x/4 - S(1)/12)**x - 1`, avoiding the issues caused by transformations involving complex or fractional exponents.
