### Title:
Fix Simplification of `(-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1` to Maintain Equivalence

### Problem:
When simplifying the expression `(-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1` using the `simplify` function, the output `12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x)` is not equivalent to the original expression for certain values of `x`.

### Analysis:
The issue lies in the fact that the simplifying mechanism for expressions involving exponents with non-trivial bases does not account for the subtle mathematical nuances that can lead to different outcomes, especially when complex numbers are involved. This results in a simplified expression that does not hold equivalence for some values.

- **Original Expression**: `(-x/4 - 1/12)**x - 1`
- **Simplified Expression**: `12**(-x)*(-12**x + (-3*x - 1)**x)`

For instance, substituting `x = 9/5` into both the original and simplified expressions yields:
- **Original Substituted Expression**: `-1 - 32*15**(1/5)*2**(2/5)/225` (≈ -1.32255)
- **Simplified Substituted Expression**: `-1 - 32*(-1)**(4/5)*60**(1/5)/225` (≈ -0.73905 - 0.18959*I)

This discrepancy indicates that the simplification has resulted in a value that introduces an imaginary component, demonstrating a failure to maintain equivalence to the original expression.

### Proposed Changes:
To address this issue, we need to modify the simplification logic in `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`. The goal is to ensure that the simplification process retains equivalence by carefully handling cases that involve complex exponentiation or special-case numeric handling.

1. **File to Modify**: `sympy/simplify/simplify.py`

#### Modifications:
- **Function/Method**: Locate the function responsible for handling the simplification of power expressions.
- **Logic Improvement**: Introduce checks to ensure the simplification does not lead to mathematically inequivalent results. Comparisons between the original and the potentially simplified output should be added for validation before finalizing the simplified expression.

Here’s a detailed description of the necessary changes:

1. **Identify Simplification Candidate**:
    

2. **Validate Simplification**:
   - Before finalizing the simplified form of the expression, validate by comparing with the original.
   - If validation fails, retain the original form.

    

3. **Validation Function**:
   - Implement a function to numerically validate the equivalence of the original and simplified expressions across a range of sample values.

    

### Conclusion:
The proposed changes involve modifying the simplification logic to include a validation step that ensures the simplified result maintains equivalence to the original expression for a range of values. This will be achieved by numerically comparing both expressions after substitution and retaining the original if the simplified version proves inequivalent.
