**Title**: Ensure Consistent Behavior for `sympify` with `ceiling` irrespective of `evaluate` Flag

**Problem**:
The behavior of the `simplify` method on expressions involving the `ceiling` function changes between SymPy versions 1.5.1 and 1.6.2 depending on the `evaluate` flag. When `evaluate=False`, the expression `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)` simplifies differently across these versions.

**Analysis**:
This inconsistency arises due to differences in how SymPy versions handle expressions involving ceiling while simplifying. In SymPy 1.6.2, when `evaluate=False`, expressions like `ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)` are more aggressively simplified into forms like `ceiling(x/4) - 3`. This does not happen when `evaluate=True`, which keeps the expression `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)` intact.

To ensure consistent behavior regardless of the `evaluate` flag, the underlying evaluation logic for ceiling needs to respect the `evaluate` flag uniformly.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Modify `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`**:
   - Check and revise the `_eval_rewrite_as_floor` and any rewrite-related methods or logic within the `ceiling` class.
   - Ensure the `simplify` method aligns behavior regardless of the `evaluate` flag.
   
2. **Detailed Changes**:
   - **`sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`**:
     - Review the current `_eval_rewrite_as_floor` and ensure that its transformation logic does not change expressions more than it should when `evaluate=False`.
     - Amend `_eval_simplify` method within `ceiling` to treat expressions consistently by referencing or conditionally bypassing overly aggressive simplifications when `evaluate=False`.

For example:


3. **Consistency for parsing and rewriting**:
   - Ensure that during the parsing and rewriting stages, the absence or presence of evaluation (`evaluate=False`) should direct the appropriate logic flow of `simplify`.

By making these changes, we ensure that expressions involving `ceiling` simplify consistently across different SymPy versions, independent of whether `evaluate=False` or `evaluate=True` is set. Also, ensure to maintain this logic for similar functions by following the same approach. 

This will provide uniformity and avoid unexpected simplifications which otherwise differ due to version-specific changes.
