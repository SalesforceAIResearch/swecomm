Inconsistent behavior for sympify/simplify with ceiling
In sympy v1.5.1:
```python
In [16]: sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False).simplify()
Out[16]: 4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)

In [17]: sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=True).simplify()
Out[17]: 4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)
```

In sympy v.1.6.2:
```python
In [16]: sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False).simplify()
Out[16]: 4*ceiling(x/4) - 3

In [17]: sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=True).simplify()
Out [17]: 4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)
```

Is there a way to ensure that the behavior is consistent, even though evaluate is equal to `False` when parsing?
