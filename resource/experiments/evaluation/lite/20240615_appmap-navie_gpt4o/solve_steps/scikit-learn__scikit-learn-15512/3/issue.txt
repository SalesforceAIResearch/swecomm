Return values of non converged affinity propagation clustering
The affinity propagation Documentation states: 
"When the algorithm does not converge, it returns an empty array as cluster_center_indices and -1 as label for each training sample."

Example:
```python
from sklearn.cluster import AffinityPropagation
import pandas as pd

data = pd.DataFrame([[1,0,0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,0,0,1]])
af = AffinityPropagation(affinity='euclidean', verbose=True, copy=False, max_iter=2).fit(data)

print(af.cluster_centers_indices_)
print(af.labels_)

```
I would expect that the clustering here (which does not converge) prints first an empty List and then [-1,-1,-1], however, I get [2] as cluster center and [0,0,0] as cluster labels. 
The only way I currently know if the clustering fails is if I use the verbose option, however that is very unhandy. A hacky solution is to check if max_iter == n_iter_ but it could have converged exactly 15 iterations before max_iter (although unlikely).
I am not sure if this is intended behavior and the documentation is wrong?

For my use-case within a bigger script, I would prefer to get back -1 values or have a property to check if it has converged, as otherwise, a user might not be aware that the clustering never converged.
