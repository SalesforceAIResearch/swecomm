### Title
Fix Affinity Propagation to Return Proper Values for Non-converged Cases

### Problem
Affinity Propagation does not adhere to its documentation which states that non-converged cases should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and -1 for each label in `labels_`. Instead, it incorrectly returns values for cluster centers and labels, misinforming the user about the clustering result.

### Analysis
The root of the issue is the way `AffinityPropagation` handles non-converged cases. The current implementation seems to inadequately check for convergence and does not update the return values (`cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_`) properly in situations where the algorithm does not converge.

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Ensure a proper check for convergence.
2. Update `cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty array and `labels_` to an array of -1 of appropriate shape when the algorithm does not converge.

### Proposed Changes
The changes should be made to the `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py` file within the `AffinityPropagation` class where the convergence check and result assignment are handled.

1. **Add Convergence Check:** 
    - Add a mechanism to properly check the convergence status at the end of the algorithm's loop. If the algorithm does not converge within the maximum predefined iterations (`max_iter`), set a flag indicating non-convergence.

2. **Update Return Values:**
    - If the algorithm does not converge, assign an empty array to `self.cluster_centers_indices_`.
    - Assign an array of -1s of same length as the number of samples to `self.labels_`.

#### Specific Changes:
- **sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py:**
  - After the iterative fitting loop, check if the algorithm converged.
  - If not converged, set `self.cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty array and `self.labels_` to an array of -1s.

### Example Code (to illustrate in words)

1. **Convergence Check and Updating State:**
    - After the iterative updating loop in the `fit` function:
      
2. **Updating Documentation:**
    - Ensure the documentation strings (`docstrings`) reflect the updated behavior clearly for future reference and user clarity.
    
This ensures that upon non-convergence, the results correctly reflect the algorithm's failure to converge, adhering to the documentation and providing a reliable output for further processing.
