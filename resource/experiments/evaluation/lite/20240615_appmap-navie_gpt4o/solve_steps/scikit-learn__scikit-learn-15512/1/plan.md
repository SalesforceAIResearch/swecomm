**Title**: Ensure Affinity Propagation Returns Correct Values When Convergence Fails

**Problem**: In the current implementation of the Affinity Propagation algorithm, when the algorithm does not converge within the specified number of iterations (`max_iter`), it still returns cluster centers and labels, which can mislead the user. According to the documentation, it should return an empty array for `cluster_center_indices_` and an array of `-1` for `labels_`. This discrepancy can cause confusion since there's no straightforward way to determine if the clustering has failed without using verbose output or additional checks.

**Analysis**: The root cause is that the `fit` method of the `AffinityPropagation` class does not properly handle the case where the algorithm fails to converge within the given `max_iter`. Instead of returning the expected empty and `-1` values, it continues to provide potentially misleading results.

To address this issue, the `fit` method needs to incorporate a check to determine if convergence was achieved. If not, it should explicitly set `cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty array and `labels_` to an array of `-1`.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `fit` method in the `AffinityPropagation` class (`sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py`).
2. After the final iteration, check whether convergence was achieved. This can be done by reviewing the convergence criteria typically stored in `self.n_iter_` (representing the number of iterations performed).
3. If the algorithm did not converge (i.e., `self.n_iter_` equals `self.max_iter`), update the attributes `cluster_centers_indices_` and `labels_` accordingly.

**Suggested Changes**:
1. **Add convergence check in `fit` method**:
   - Locate the end of the main iteration loop or the `fit` method where the final results (`cluster_centers_indices_`, `labels_`) are assigned.
   - Implement a conditional check to detect if `self.n_iter_` equals `self.max_iter` without convergence.
   - Set `self.cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty array and `self.labels_` to an array of `-1` if convergence is not achieved.
  
Example Outline:



By making these adjustments, the Affinity Propagation algorithm will correctly reflect non-convergence according to the documentation, thereby improving user awareness and preventing misleading outcomes.
