**Title: Modify AffinityPropagation to Return -1 Labels and Empty Cluster Centers on Non-Convergence**

**Problem:**
The `AffinityPropagation` algorithm in sklearn does not behave as expected when it fails to converge. According to the documentation, it should return an empty array for `cluster_center_indices_` and `-1` for each training sample in `labels_`. However, the current implementation returns non-empty cluster centers and incorrect labels.

**Analysis:**
The non-convergence behavior of the `AffinityPropagation` class appears to be improperly handled. When the maximum number of iterations (`max_iter`) is reached without convergence, the algorithm still returns the cluster centers and labels based on the last iteration. This contradicts the documented behavior where an empty array should be returned for `cluster_center_indices_` and `-1` for `labels_`.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. Modify the `AffinityPropagation` class to include a check for convergence after completing the maximum number of iterations.
2. If the algorithm does not converge, set `cluster_center_indices_` to an empty array and `labels_` to `-1` for each sample.
3. Add an attribute or method to check if the algorithm has converged. This will provide a more explicit way for users to verify the convergence status.

**Detailed Changes:**
1. **File:** `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py`
    - Update the `fit` method within the `AffinityPropagation` class:
        - After the iterations loop, add a condition to check if `self.converged_` is `False`.
        - If the algorithm has not converged, set `self.cluster_centers_indices_` to an empty numpy array (`np.array([])`) and `self.labels_` to `-1` for each sample in `X`.
    - Ensure that the `self.converged_` attribute is set to `True` or `False` during the fitting process.
    - Modify or add methods to explicitly check the convergence status, such as `is_converged()`.

**Steps to Implement Changes:**
1. Go to the `AffinityPropagation` class in `sklearn/cluster/_affinity_propagation.py`.
2. Locate the `fit` method where the main iterations for the clustering algorithm takes place.
3. At the end of the iterations loop, add a check:
    - 
4. Add a method to the `AffinityPropagation` class:
    - 
5. Ensure that the `converged_` attribute is appropriately set based on the iteration results.

This change will ensure that the `AffinityPropagation` class correctly reflects the non-convergence in its output, adhering to the stated documentation and providing clarity for users.
