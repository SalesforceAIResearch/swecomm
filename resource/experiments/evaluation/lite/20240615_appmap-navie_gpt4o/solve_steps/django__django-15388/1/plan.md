**Title**: Fix Dev Server Restart Issue when Adding BASE_DIR to TEMPLATES[0]['DIRS']

**Problem**
The Django development server fails to restart when there is an addition of `BASE_DIR` to the `DIRS` list in `TEMPLATES[0]` within `settings.py`. This issue occurs due to an underlying bug that prevents the server's auto-restart mechanism from detecting changes when `BASE_DIR` is included in the `DIRS` list.

**Analysis**
This issue is likely related to how Django handles template directories and monitors file changes. When `BASE_DIR` is added to the `DIRS` list, the path provided might interfere with the server's ability to track changes properly. The problem could be arising from the file watching mechanism in Django's runserver command, which fails to register updates on certain paths or directory structures.

To address this issue:
- Investigate the `get_template_sources` method and related methods in Django's template loading system.
- Ensure that the file watching mechanism used in the development server (`runserver` management command) correctly includes and processes `BASE_DIR` changes in the `DIRS` list.
- Fix the directory path handling to ensure changes in the `BASE_DIR` directory are detected and result in a server restart.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **File**: `django/template/loaders/filesystem.py`
   - **Function**: `get_template_sources`
   - **Description**: Review and ensure that the method correctly gathers template sources including those specified through `BASE_DIR`. It should safely join the template directory with the template name and handle directory traversal issues gracefully. Adjustments might be needed to ensure that directories added through `BASE_DIR` are correctly marked for monitoring.

2. **File**: `django/core/management/commands/runserver.py`
   - **Function**: `_start_reloader` and `watchman_reload`
   - **Description**: Review and ensure that the file watching mechanism includes directories specified through `BASE_DIR`. Additional logging can be added to check whether these directories are recognized during the initialization phase.

3. **File**: `django/utils/autoreload.py`
   - **Function**: `watch_dir`
   - **Description**: Check the function responsible for watching directories and ensure it can handle paths added via `BASE_DIR`.

Detailed changes to each file:
- In `filesystem.py`, ensure `get_dirs` and `get_template_sources` methods correctly handle `BASE_DIR` as a valid directory source.
- In `runserver.py`, modify the reloader initialization to recognize added paths for reloading when `BASE_DIR` is included in `DIRS`.
- In `autoreload.py`, make sure `watch_dir` is correctly set up to monitor paths, including those added dynamically through settings.

By ensuring that these parts of the code correctly recognize and watch directories added via `BASE_DIR`, we can address the issue preventing the dev server from restarting upon file changes.
