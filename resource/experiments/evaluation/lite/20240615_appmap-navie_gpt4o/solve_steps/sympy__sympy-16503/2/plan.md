**Title**: Align the Sum operator's terms correctly in pretty print output

**Problem**: 
In the SymPy library, when pretty-printing an expression that involves a summation combined with another term (e.g., `Sum(x, (x, 1, oo)) + 3`), the terms are misaligned. Specifically, the summand `x` and the additional term `+ 3` are not properly aligned vertically:

The `+ 3` should be aligned with the `x` in the summation.

**Analysis**:
The issue lies in the rendering logic of the pretty print function. When combining a `Sum` object with other terms, the height of the summation's visual structure is not being considered properly, resulting in misalignment of the terms. The pretty printer needs to ensure that all parts of the expression are adjusted vertically to match the highest element.

**Proposed Changes**:
Focus on modifying the pretty print logic within the SymPy library to ensure vertical alignment of terms when rendering sums combined with other terms.

1. **sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py**:
   - Modify the logic in the module responsible for constructing the pretty-printed output of mathematical expressions.
   - Ensure proper alignment for additions where one operand is a `Sum` object. Adjust vertical positioning based on the height of the sum's visual structure.

2. **sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_print.py**:
   - Integrate alignment logic to the `prettyForm`, which handles the creation of pretty output for complex expressions.
   - When calling the pretty print function of `Sum`, consider the height of the resultant structure and adjust the position of other additive terms.

### Detailed Changes:

#### File: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_symbology.py`
- Locate the function that deals with the pretty-printing of summation (`Sum`) expressions.
- Integrate logic to compute the total height of the summation, including its upper and lower limits.
- Adjust the vertical positioning of following terms (`+ 3` in your case) to ensure alignment.

#### File: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty_print.py`
- In the section of the code where expressions are combined (handling addition), reference the height of the `Sum`.
- Ensure that any following terms in the expression (`+ 3`) are positioned vertically to match the height of the summation part.
- This might involve calculating the max height between the summation and the other terms during the rendering phase and aligning subsequent terms accordingly.

By making these changes, the pretty print function will correctly align terms when printing complex expressions involving summations, ensuring a more visually accurate and readable mathematical representation.
