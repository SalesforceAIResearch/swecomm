Fix alignment issues in Sum pretty print

### Problem

When pretty-printing a summation, the terms following the summation are not properly aligned with the summation term itself. The summation term appears at a higher position compared to the following terms.

### Analysis

The root cause of the issue lies in how the summation term and the following terms are handled by the pretty printing function. The alignment issue appears because the height of the summation structure influences where subsequent terms are rendered. To fix this, we need to ensure that subsequent terms are properly aligned with the baseline of the summation term.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Locate the pretty-printing function for summation**:
    - The function responsible for pretty-printing summation terms needs to account for proper alignment of terms that follow the summation.

2. **Adjust the vertical alignment handling**:
    - Inspect how terms are vertically aligned in relation to the summation.
    - Ensure that the baseline for the following terms is the same as for the summation term.

3. **Modify the code to align following terms with the summation**:
    - The relevant code where the summation and following terms are stitched together must be adjusted to consider the height and baseline corrections.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Find the Pretty Printing Function:**
    - Locate the function that handles the pretty printing of summation terms. This function will likely be involved in constructing the ASCII or Unicode representation of the summation.

2. **Modify Alignment Strategy:**
    - Ensure that the pretty-printer takes into account the height and position of the summation symbol.
    - Calculate the appropriate baseline for the following terms and adjust their vertical position.

3. **Update and Validate:**
    - Make necessary code updates to perform these alignment corrections.
    - Validate the changes with various examples to ensure the alignment is consistent and visually correct.

By following these steps, the alignment issue should be resolved, ensuring that the `x` and the `+ 3` terms are appropriately aligned in the printed output.
