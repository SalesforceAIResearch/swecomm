**Title**: Fix Alignment Issue in Pretty Print for Sum Expressions

**Problem**: The pretty print output for sum expressions with additional terms does not align the sum's index variable and the additional term correctly. Specifically, the index variable `x` and the additional term `+ 3` are misaligned.

**Analysis**: The issue appears when rendering a sum expression followed by an additional term in the `pprint` function. The root cause is the failure to consider the height and alignment of the sumâ€™s components relative to subsequent terms when constructing the final pretty-printed output. This misalignment can create visual inconsistencies, making the expression harder to read.

In math display, ensuring components align correctly is important for readability, especially in complex expressions. A likely reason for this bug is that when formatting the sum expression, the function does not adjust for the vertical alignment of the sum term relative to the following additive term (`+ 3`).

To fix this, the code responsible for generating the pretty print of the sum terms must be modified to ensure vertical alignment. We need to adjust the vertical offset of the additional terms to match the height of the sum expression.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File to Modify**: `sympy/printing/tree.py`

2. **Function to Modify**: Modify the `pprint_nodes` function or related utility functions to ensure that subsequent terms are properly aligned with the main sum expression. Here's a detailed modification plan:
   
   - **Adjust Vertical Alignment**:
     - Locate the section of the code where the sum terms are concatenated with additional terms.
     - Determine the height of the sum expression and calculate the appropriate vertical offset for the additional terms.
     - Apply the vertical offset to ensure the terms align properly.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - **Calculate the Height**: When creating the string for the sum, determine its height (number of text lines it spans).
   - **Adjust Offsets**: Adjust the vertical position of any terms following the sum expression to ensure they align at the correct vertical position. Either the `x` in the sum expression should be lowered, or the `+3` should be raised, depending on the relative heights.

4. **Checks and Test**:
   - Verify that simple sum expressions without additional terms still render correctly.
   - Check sum expressions with additional terms for alignment.
   - Ensure other pretty print functionalities remain unaffected by the changes.

These changes should ensure that the sum and additional terms are correctly aligned vertically, improving the readability of the pretty-printed output.
