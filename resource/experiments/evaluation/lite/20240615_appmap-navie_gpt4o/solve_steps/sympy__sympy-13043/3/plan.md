**Title**: Ensure deterministic order in decompose() function output when separate=True

**Problem**: 
The `decompose()` function in `intpoly.py` returns a list of arbitrary order when the parameter `separate=True`. This arbitrary ordering resulted in test failures after changes to the core were made. The order of the returned list needs to be deterministic to rectify this issue.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the problem is that the list generated from the dictionary values (`list(poly_dict.values())`) does not guarantee any specific order. When the `decompose()` function is called with `separate=True`, it returns this list directly. The lack of a defined order in these returned lists, especially when the function is involved in testing scenarios, leads to inconsistent results and failures.

To fix this, we need to sort the monomials before returning them. Since the `poly_dict` constructed in `decompose()` has degrees as its keys and corresponding polynomial terms as values, we can sort the list based on these degrees to return them in a deterministic order.

**Proposed Changes**: 
The file to be modified is `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`. The following changes are recommended:

1. **Modify decompose() function in `intpoly.py`:**
   - Ensure that when `separate=True`, the returned list of monomials is sorted. 
   - Modify the return statement under the `separate` condition to return a sorted list of monomials based on their degrees from the `poly_dict`.

### Detailed Changes:

#### In `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`:

1. Locate the return statement for the `separate` condition in the `decompose()` function:



2. Modify it to sort the monomials based on their degrees before returning:



This modification ensures that the list of monomials will always be returned in a sorted order based on the degrees, providing a deterministic order and preventing test failures due to arbitrary ordering.

With these changes, the `decompose()` function will return a consistently ordered list of monomials when `separate=True`, thereby resolving the arbitrary order issue and associated test failures.
