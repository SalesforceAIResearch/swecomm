**Title**: Modify `decompose()` Function in `intpoly` to Return a Sorted List of Values

**Problem**: 
The `decompose()` function in the `intpoly.py` file returns the values of `poly_dict` as a list when `separate=True`. However, since dictionaries do not guarantee an order, this list is unordered, leading to arbitrary order results. This behavior is causing test failures after recent changes to the core.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is that dictionaries in Python, especially before version 3.7, do not guarantee the order of their keys, leading to arbitrarily ordered lists when calling `list(poly_dict.values())`. To resolve this, the values should be sorted in a consistent manner before being returned. The sorting criteria can be chosen based on specific attributes of the polynomials such as their degrees or other meaningful properties.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `intpoly.py`
    - **Location**: Modify the `decompose` function.
    - **Solution**: 
        - Identify a meaningful sorting criterion for the polynomials (e.g., degree, lexicographic order of terms).
        - Sort the values of `poly_dict` based on this criterion before returning them.
    
    Code change description:
    - After constructing `poly_dict`, when `separate` is `True`, sort the list based on the chosen criterion such as degree.
    - Replace `return list(poly_dict.values())` with `return sorted(poly_dict.values(), key=lambda poly: <sorting_criterion>)`.

2. **File**: `intpoly.py`
    - **Location**: Actual `decompose` function where the poly_dict is used.
    - **Solution**:
        - Ensure the sorted list of values is returned by altering the return statement of the function when `separate=True`.

Detailed change:
- Identify the return statement in the `decompose` function: `return list(poly_dict.values())`.
- Replace it with a sorted return statement: `return sorted(poly_dict.values(), key=<sorting_key_function>)`.

Example sorting criterion:


By making these changes, you will ensure that the `decompose` method returns a consistently ordered list of polynomial terms, which will prevent test failures caused by unordered lists.

Would you like me to provide an exact code change description for the sorting key function?
