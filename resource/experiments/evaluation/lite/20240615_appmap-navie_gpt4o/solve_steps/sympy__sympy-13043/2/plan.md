**Title**: Sort the constituent monomials list in decompose() function

**Problem**: The `decompose()` function, when called with `separate=True`, returns a list of the constituent monomials in an arbitrary order. This causes inconsistencies and test failures after some changes to the core.

**Analysis**: The `decompose()` function in `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py` decomposes a polynomial into homogeneous polynomials of smaller or equal degrees. When the `separate` flag is set to `True`, the function returns a list of these constituent monomials. However, because `list(poly_dict.values())` does not guarantee order, the returned list order can vary, leading to flaky tests.

To ensure consistent behavior, especially in testing, the returned list must be ordered. Sorting the list of polynomials based on their degrees or some other criteria will provide a consistent output.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Modify sympy/integrals/intpoly.py**:
   - Refactor the `decompose()` function to return a sorted list of the constituent monomials when `separate=True`.

   The changes should be made in the `decompose()` function to ensure the returned list of monomials is sorted. Specifically, the output list generated by `list(poly_dict.values())` should be sorted before returning.

   **Updated Function Logic**:
   - Inside the `decompose()` function, where the `separate` flag is checked, sort the monomials before returning.

   **Steps**:
   - Locate where `list(poly_dict.values())` is returned in the function.
   - Modify this to return a sorted list. If degrees are integers, a simple numerical sort would be adequate.

Here is a description of the steps within the relevant function:
   
    1. In the `decompose()` function, find the block where the return statement `return list(poly_dict.values())` is executed when `separate` is `True`.
    2. Before the return statement inside the `if separate` block, sort `poly_dict.values()` based on polynomial degrees.
    3. Replace the `return list(poly_dict.values())` statement with `return sorted(list(poly_dict.values()), key=lambda p: degree_of_polynomial(p))`. Ensure `degree_of_polynomial` is a utility function or lambda that correctly determines the polynomial degree.

By making these changes, the function will return a sorted list of constituent monomials, ensuring consistent ordering and resolving the test failures caused by arbitrary ordering.

These detailed steps should guide you in implementing the changes to the `decompose()` function:
- **Proposed Changes to `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`**:
   - Implement sorting in `decompose()` function:
      - **Function**: `decompose`
      - **Line**: Around `sympy/integrals/intpoly.py:595-597`
      - **Change**:
        - Replace `return list(poly_dict.values())` with `return sorted(list(poly_dict.values()), key=lambda p: degree_of_polynomial(p))`.
        - Ensure the lambda function `degree_of_polynomial` is correctly implemented or refactor an existing logic to retrieve polynomial degrees, necessary to sort the polynomials in the list.

This change will ensure that the output of `decompose` remains consistent and ordered regardless of internal dictionary ordering, eliminating the cause of nondeterministic behavior and test failures.
