**Title**: Fix `ccode` to Support `sinc` Function by Expanding it to Piecewise Expression

**Problem**: 
The `ccode` function in SymPy's C code printer does not support the `sinc` function and currently generates an unsupported comment when attempting to print it. Ideally, the `sinc` function should be expanded to its piecewise definition when printing C code.

**Analysis**:
The `sinc` function is defined as:
- \( \frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} \) when \( \theta \neq 0 \)
- 1 when \( \theta = 0 \)

Since `math.h` does not have a built-in `sinc` function, a custom piecewise function needs to be generated in the C code. You have already shown that `ccode` can handle general piecewise functions. To solve the problem, the `sinc` function should be expanded to its piecewise form and then printed correctly.

The change involves overriding the `_print_sinc` method to expand the `sinc` function into its piecewise representation before converting it to C code.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: sympy/printing/ccode.py**
    - Modify the `_print_sinc` method to handle the `sinc` function by expanding it into a piecewise expression representing:
      - \( \frac{\sin(x)}{x} \) when \( x \neq 0 \)
      - 1 when \( x = 0 \)

2. Modify `_print_sinc` function:
   - Expand `sinc` to a `Piecewise` expression.
   - Use the C code printer to print the `Piecewise` expression.

Detailed steps:
- In `sympy/printing/ccode.py`, locate the `_print_sinc` method.
   - Inside `_print_sinc`, return a piecewise expression using existing printer methods for piecewise functions.

**Modification Details**:
python
      from sympy import Piecewise, sin, Ne
      python
      def _print_sinc(self, expr):
          piecewise_expr = Piecewise((sin(expr)/expr, Ne(expr, 0)), (1, True))
          return self._print(piecewise_expr)
      ```

By following this plan, the `ccode` function will properly handle the `sinc` function by expanding it to its piecewise representation and printing the appropriate C code.

After implementing these changes, ensure to verify the output with some test cases in a local development environment to confirm the new behavior.
