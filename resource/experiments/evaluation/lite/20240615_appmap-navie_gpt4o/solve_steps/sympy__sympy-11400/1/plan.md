**Title**: Implement proper printing for sinc function in C code

**Problem**: The `ccode` function does not generate the correct C code for the `sinc(x)` function, instead it outputs that `sinc` is not supported.

**Analysis**: The `ccode` function is part of SymPy's printing module that converts SymPy expressions to C code strings using functions defined in `math.h`. Currently, `sinc` is not supported by the C printer, which defaults to outputting a comment indicating unsupported functionality. However, we can implement the sinc function by printing it as a `Piecewise` expression: 

\[ \text{sinc}(\theta) = \begin{cases} 
\frac{\sin(\theta)}{\theta} & \text{if } \theta \neq 0 \\
1 & \text{if } \theta = 0 
\end{cases} \]

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/ccode.py`
   - **Function**: `_print_sinc` implementation
   - Modify the `_print_sinc` method to print the `sinc` function properly by representing it as a `Piecewise` expression. 

   **Details**:
   - The `_print_sinc` function should generate C code that checks whether the argument is zero and prints `1` in that case, otherwise it should print the ratio of `sin(x)` to `x`.
