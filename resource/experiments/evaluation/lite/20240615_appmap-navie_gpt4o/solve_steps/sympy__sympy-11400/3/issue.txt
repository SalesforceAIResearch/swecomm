ccode(sinc(x)) doesn't work
```
In [30]: ccode(sinc(x))
Out[30]: '// Not supported in C:\n// sinc\nsinc(x)'
```

I don't think `math.h` has `sinc`, but it could print

```
In [38]: ccode(Piecewise((sin(theta)/theta, Ne(theta, 0)), (1, True)))
Out[38]: '((Ne(theta, 0)) ? (\n   sin(theta)/theta\n)\n: (\n   1\n))'
```
