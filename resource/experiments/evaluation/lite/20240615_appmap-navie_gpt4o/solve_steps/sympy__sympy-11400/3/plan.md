**Title**: Implement `ccode` Translation for `sinc` Function

**Problem**: 
The `ccode` function in SymPy currently fails to correctly translate the `sinc` function to C code. Instead, it outputs a placeholder indicating that `sinc` is not supported. In C, the `sinc` function can be approximated by using a conditional expression to handle the two cases: one where the input is zero and another for non-zero input.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the `sinc` function is not natively supported in C libraries (such as `math.h`). The workaround is to manually translate it using a `Piecewise` function that defines `sinc(x)` as `sin(x)/x` for `x != 0` and `1` for `x == 0`. This logic needs to be incorporated into the `ccode` function for the `sinc` function. 

We need to:
1. Update the `_print_sinc` method in `sympy/printing/ccode.py` to correctly translate the `sinc` function into an appropriate C representation using a conditional expression.

**Proposed Changes**:
- Modify the `_print_sinc` method in the file `sympy/printing/ccode.py`:
  - Replace the current placeholder logic with a conditional expression that reflects the correct definition of `sinc(x)`.

**Detailed Modifications**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/ccode.py`
   - **Function**: `_print_sinc`
     - Modify the code to return a C-compatible expression using `Piecewise` to represent `sinc(x)`.

### Modified `_print_sinc` Method:

In the `_print_sinc` method:
- Instead of the current placeholder return statement, implement logic that translates `sinc(x)` to a conditional C expression:
  - If the argument is zero, the expression is `1`.
  - Otherwise, it is `sin(x)/x`.

### Detailed Change Description:

1. **Locate** the `_print_sinc` method.
2. **Update** the method body to construct the C code string using a conditional expression format.

Here is a high-level description of the changes:

- **Current Logic**:
  
- **Proposed Logic**:
  

**Explanation**:
- `self._print(expr.args[0])` converts the SymPy expression for the argument of `sinc` to a string.
- The new return statement generates a conditional expression: `((x != 0) ? (sin(x)/x) : 1)` which is proper C code to represent `sinc(x)`.

By making this change, the `ccode` function will correctly handle the `sinc` function and produce valid C code for it.
