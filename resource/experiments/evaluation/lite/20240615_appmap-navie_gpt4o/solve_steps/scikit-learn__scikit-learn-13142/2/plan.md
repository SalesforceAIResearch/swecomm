**Title:** Ensure Consistency Between `fit_predict` and `predict` in `GaussianMixture` with Multiple Initializations

**Problem:**
When using the `GaussianMixture` model in Scikit-learn with `n_init` set to a value greater than 1, the results of the `fit_predict(X)` and `predict(X)` methods are often different. The discrepancy occurs because the `fit_predict` method directly returns the clusters assigned at the end of the best initialization, whereas the `predict` method classifies the input data based on the converged model parameters. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected results for users relying on these methods to give consistent outputs. Currently, this issue is not caught by `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` because the test does not set `n_init`.

**Analysis:**
- The `fit_predict(X)` method in the `GaussianMixture` class fits the model to the data `X` and immediately returns the cluster indices for each sample in `X`.
- The `predict(X)` method uses the fitted model parameters (means, covariances, and weights) to assign clusters to the samples in `X`.
- When `n_init` is specified as greater than 1, the model is initialized multiple times, and the best result is kept based on the log-likelihood. This can lead to a situation where the initialization leading to the best log-likelihood assigns clusters differently compared to the final model parameters evaluated by `predict(X)`.
- To ensure consistency, the clustered labels returned by `fit_predict` after the best initialization should match those from `predict` based on the final fitted model.

**Proposed Changes:**
Modify the `fit_predict` method within the `GaussianMixture` class implementation in `sklearn/mixture/_gaussian_mixture.py` to ensure consistency with the `predict` method. This involves retraining the model in `fit_predict` to obtain the cluster indices in a manner consistent with `predict`.

1. **Modify `fit_predict` method:**
   - Instead of directly returning the cluster assignments from the initial fit, use the fitted model parameters to call `self.predict(X)` and return its result.
   - This approach ensures that `fit_predict` provides cluster indices consistent with the `predict` method.

This ensures that both `fit_predict(X)` and `predict(X)` give consistent cluster assignments based on the final fitted model parameters after optimizing with `n_init`.

**Additional Steps:**
1. Ensure the `test_gaussian_mixture_fit_predict` now includes cases where `n_init` is set to values greater than 1, verifying that outputs from `fit_predict`  and `predict` match.

By implementing these changes, the consistency between `fit_predict` and `predict` methods in `GaussianMixture` when `n_init` is greater than 1 will be maintained, providing a reliable and user-friendly experience.
