**Title**: Ensure Consistency in GaussianMixture `fit_predict` and `predict` Methods When `n_init > 1`

**Problem**:
When using the `GaussianMixture` class from the `sklearn.mixture` module with `n_init` set to a value greater than 1, the results of the `fit_predict(X)` method and the `predict(X)` method are inconsistent. This discrepancy arises because `fit_predict` finds and uses the best initialization during multiple runs, but it seems that subsequent calls to `predict` do not always reflect this optimal initialization.

**Analysis**:
The crux of the issue lies in the methods `fit_predict` and `predict` within the `GaussianMixture` implementation. The `fit_predict` method performs clustering and directly returns the labels based on the best initialization found after multiple runs (`n_init` > 1). However, the `predict` method relies on the state of the fitted model. If the internal state isn't updated correctly in sync with the final result of `fit_predict`, the subsequent `predict` call might produce different labels.

To address this, we need to ensure that the model's state is consistent after calling `fit_predict` so that subsequent `predict` calls yield the same labels.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sklearn/mixture/_base.py`
   - **Function**: `fit_predict(self, X, y=None)`
     - Modify the end of the function to ensure that the state of the object appropriately reflects the final state used in `fit_predict`.
   - Ensure that any attributes or states updated within `fit_predict` are similarly set or checked against `predict`.

2. **File**: `sklearn/mixture/_base.py`
   - **Function**: `predict(self, X)`
     - Verify that `predict` is operating on the up-to-date state yielded by the last `fit_predict`.

**Detailed Changes**:

1. **In `sklearn/mixture/_base.py`**:
   - _Inside `fit_predict` method_:
     - After performing the clustering and obtaining `labels`, ensure that this state is preserved within the model so that `predict` uses this state.
     - Ensure that any temporary variables or states related to the best run in `fit_predict` are stored persistently in the model's attributes.

2. **In `sklearn/mixture/_base.py`**:
   - _Inside `predict` method_:
     - Ensure that it uses the final clustering state that was computed during the last `fit_predict` call if it exists.
     - Add checks or update logic to handle the case where `fit_predict` was the last method called, ensuring consistent labels are returned.

By focusing on these changes, we can ensure that the `GaussianMixture` model produces consistent and reliable results across `fit_predict` and `predict` when `n_init` is greater than 1.

This update will ensure that users can rely on `fit_predict` to set the model's state in a way that subsequent `predict` calls will produce consistent clustering results.
