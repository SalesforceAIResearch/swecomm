**Title: Modify ModelChoiceField to Include Invalid Value in ValidationError**

**Problem:**
The `ModelChoiceField` does not display the value of the invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`. This contrasts with `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, which provides the invalid value in the error message. To improve consistency and provide better feedback, the error message for `ModelChoiceField` should be adjusted to include the invalid value.

**Analysis:**
The `ModelChoiceField` class should include the invalid value in the raised `ValidationError`. This involves modifying the `default_error_messages` dictionary for the `invalid_choice` key to match the format used in `ModelMultipleChoiceField`.

The `ModelChoiceField` should be updated to include the invalid value by interpolating the `%(value)s` placeholder within the error message. This will provide the end-user with specific feedback on which input was invalid, improving clarity.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File:** `django/forms/models.py`

2. **Function/Class to Modify:** `ModelChoiceField`

3. **Changes to Make:** 
   - Update the `default_error_messages` dictionary by changing the message for the `invalid_choice` key to include the `%(value)s` placeholder.
   - Ensure the `ValidationError` raised during validation passes the invalid value.

**Detailed Description of Changes:**

1. **Update `default_error_messages`:**
   - Locate the `ModelChoiceField` class definition.
   - Modify the `default_error_messages` dictionary for the `invalid_choice` key. Change the current error message from:
     
     To:
     

2. **Update Validation Logic:**
   - Ensure when the `ValidationError` for an invalid choice is raised, the `value` is included in the error context so that it can be interpolated into the error message.

By making these changes, the `ModelChoiceField` will then provide meaningful error messages that include the specific invalid value, aligning with the behavior of `ModelMultipleChoiceField`. This not only improves consistency within the framework but also aids in better user experience and debugging.
