**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

ModelChoiceField does not provide value of invalid choice when raising ValidationError
Description
	 
		(last modified by Aaron Wiegel)
	 
Compared with ChoiceField and others, ModelChoiceField does not show the value of the invalid choice when raising a validation error. Passing in parameters with the invalid value and modifying the default error message for the code invalid_choice should fix this.
From source code:
class ModelMultipleChoiceField(ModelChoiceField):
	"""A MultipleChoiceField whose choices are a model QuerySet."""
	widget = SelectMultiple
	hidden_widget = MultipleHiddenInput
	default_error_messages = {
		'invalid_list': _('Enter a list of values.'),
		'invalid_choice': _('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the'
							' available choices.')... (1249)
