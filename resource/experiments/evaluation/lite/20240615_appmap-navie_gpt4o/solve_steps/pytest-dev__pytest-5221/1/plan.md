**Title**: Update `pytest --fixtures` to Display Fixture Scope

**Problem**: 
When running `pytest --fixtures`, the output does not include the scope of each fixture. Users currently need to refer to documentation or inspect the source code to determine a fixture's scope, which is inefficient and inconvenient.

**Analysis**: 
The `pytest --fixtures` command outputs a list of available fixtures. However, it does not currently display the scope of these fixtures (e.g., function, class, module, session). This information is crucial for understanding the fixture's lifecycle and how it impacts test execution.

To solve this problem, we need to modify the code responsible for generating the `pytest --fixtures` output. We should ensure that each fixture's scope is fetched and displayed alongside the fixture's name and description.

**Proposed Changes**:
* File: `src/_pytest/capture.py`

  Modify the function responsible for displaying the fixtures to include fixture scope:

1. Locate the function that processes the fixture information for display, most likely where fixture introspection is performed.

2. Ensure the fixture's `scope` attribute is retrieved and included in the display output.

3. Update the display format to integrate the scope information, making sure it's clear and concise (e.g., name, scope, and description).

In detail:
1. **Locate the Introspection Logic**:
   - Identify the function or method gathering fixture information. This is where the fixture name, description, and now the scope will be collected.

2. **Retrieve Fixture Scope**:
   - Access the `scope` attribute of each fixture. This attribute is defined when a fixture is declared using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator.
   
3. **Update Display Format**:
   - Modify the format string or rendering logic to append the scope information next to the fixture name.
   - Ensure that the scope information is placed in a readable and consistent location. For example, it can be appended in parentheses or after a colon.

After making these changes, running `pytest --fixtures` should show each fixture's scope, providing users with valuable information without needing additional references.

By focusing on updating the introspection and display logic within this relevant file, we can achieve the desired feature enhancement with minimal disruption to the existing codebase.

**Summary**: 
Updating the `pytest --fixtures` command to include fixture scope involves:
1. Accessing the scope information of each fixture.
2. Adjusting the introspection to fetch this data.
3. Modifying the display function to incorporate and properly format the scope info next to each fixture's name and description.
