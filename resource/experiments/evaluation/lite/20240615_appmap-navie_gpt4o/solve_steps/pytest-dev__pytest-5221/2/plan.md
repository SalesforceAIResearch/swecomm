**Title**: Display fixture scope with `pytest --fixtures`

**Problem**: When running `pytest --fixtures`, the current output does not include the scope of the fixtures. The scope information is crucial as it defines the lifecycle of the fixture (i.e., how often it is setup and torn down). Currently, users need to look at the documentation or the source code to determine the scope of a fixture, which can be cumbersome.

**Analysis**: Pytest fixtures can have different scopes such as function, class, module, and session. The scope is defined when the fixture is declared using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator. Adding scope information to the output of `pytest --fixtures` would be helpful for users to understand the fixture lifecycle without diving into the code or documentation.

To achieve this, we need to modify how the fixture information is displayed by incorporating the scope into the output. The scope information is part of the `FixtureDef` object that we can access and display.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `src/_pytest/capture.py`
   - Modify the function that gathers and displays the fixture information to include the scope attribute. This involves updating the method that handles the display logic for fixtures to append the scope information to the description.

Detailed changes:
1. **Function**: `pytest --fixtures` output generation (explore the exact functions handling the fixtures display logic)
2. Enhance the display format to include the fixture scope. Typically, modify a function that iterates through fixtures, gathers their metadata (including scope), and formats the output.

For example, in the function where fixtures are listed:
- Retrieve the scope information from the `FixtureDef` object.
- Append this scope information to the fixture description string.

This ensures the scope of each fixture is included in the output when running `pytest --fixtures`. By making these adjustments, users can easily see the scope of each fixture directly in the terminal output, improving usability and clarity.
