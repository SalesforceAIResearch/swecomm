**Title**: Update UsernameValidator to Prevent Trailing Newline in Usernames

**Problem**: 
The `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` in `django/contrib/auth/validators.py` use the regex `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'`. This regex unintentionally allows trailing newlines in usernames because the `$` character matches the end of the string or a newline at the end of the string. To prevent usernames from ending with a newline, the regex should use `\A` and `\Z` which match the start and end of the string, respectively, without considering newlines.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the issue lies in the use of `^` and `$` in the regular expressions within `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`. These anchors allow a trailing newline at the end of the string. By switching to `\A` (start of the string) and `\Z` (end of the string), we can ensure that the entire string must match the pattern without any trailing newline.

The logic changes are minimal and involve updating the regex pattern in both validators. No additional testing or new files are necessary since the change is confined to improving the regex pattern used for validation.

**Proposed Changes**: 
1. **File**: `django/contrib/auth/validators.py`
   - **ASCIIUsernameValidator**:
     - Modify the `regex` from `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'`.
   - **UnicodeUsernameValidator**:
     - Modify the `regex` from `r'^[\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\A[\w.@+-]+\Z'`.

Update the relevant sections in the file as follows:
   
   - Locate the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class:
     
     Change the `regex` to:
     
   
   - Locate the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class:
     
     Change the `regex` to:
     

These minimal changes will ensure that the validators no longer accept usernames with trailing newlines, adhering strictly to the intended validation criteria.
