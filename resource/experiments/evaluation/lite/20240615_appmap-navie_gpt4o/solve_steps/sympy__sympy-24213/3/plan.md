**Title**: Correct dimension comparison logic in _collect_factor_and_dimension for addition expressions

**Problem**: The `_collect_factor_and_dimension` function in `UnitSystem` does not correctly detect equivalent dimensions when handling addition expressions, resulting in a `ValueError` when adding quantities with complex compatible dimensions.

**Analysis**: The issue lies in the way `_collect_factor_and_dimension` handles dimension comparison for addition expressions. When multiple terms are involved in addition, the function currently expects each term to have the exact same dimensions. However, quantities like velocity (v1) and acceleration multiplied by time (a1 * t1) should be treated as dimensionally compatible, even though their direct dimensions differ initially (velocity vs. acceleration*time).

To fix this, we can adjust the dimension comparison logic for the addition case to allow for dimensional equivalence. This would involve:
1. Replacing the direct equality check with a function that verifies if two dimensions can be considered equivalent based on their physical meanings.
2. Correctly updating the combined dimensions when equivalent dimensions are found.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`

   - **Function**: `_collect_factor_and_dimension`
   - **Change Logic**:
     - Modify the segment of the function that processes `Add` expressions.
     - Instead of directly comparing the dimensions of addends, implement a dimensional equivalence check.
     - Update the result dimension based on the physical meaning of combined equivalent dimensions.

   - **Detailed Steps**:
     1. **Retrieve Initial Factor and Dimension**:
        - For the first addend, retrieve its scale factor and dimension using `_collect_factor_and_dimension`.

     2. **Iterate Through Addends**:
        - For each subsequent addend, retrieve its scale factor and dimension.
        - Use a function to check if the current addend's dimension is equivalent to the result dimension so far.
          - If they are equivalent, update the scale factor without raising an error.
          - Equivalence can be determined based on established dimension combinations (like velocity being equivalent to acceleration * time).

     3. **Update Aggregate Values**:
        - Accumulate the scale factors.
        - Maintain or update the result dimension based on the types of quantities involved.

Here's a more detailed description of the changes to the function `_collect_factor_and_dimension`:

- **Initialization**: Retrieve the scale factor and dimension for the first argument.
  

- **Iterate Over Addends**:
  
  `are_dimensions_equivalent` should be a new method that determines if two dimensions can be treated as equivalent (e.g., velocity vs. acceleration * time).

- **Dimension Equivalence Checking**:
  The `are_dimensions_equivalent` method should:
  - Take two dimensions as input.
  - Return `True` if they can be considered equivalent, otherwise `False`.
  - Include known dimension equivalence rules (e.g., velocity == acceleration \* time).

Implement these changes to ensure that dimensionally equivalent quantities can be added without errors, allowing for more flexible and accurate physical calculations.
