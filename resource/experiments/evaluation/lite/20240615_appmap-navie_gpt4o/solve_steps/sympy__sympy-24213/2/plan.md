**Title**: Refactor _collect_factor_and_dimension to Detect Equivalent Dimensions in Addition

**Problem**: 
The method `_collect_factor_and_dimension` in the UnitSystem class fails to detect equivalent dimensions correctly when adding quantities with different but compatible dimensions—for example, adding velocity (`v1`) with the product of acceleration (`a1`) and time (`t1`).

**Analysis**: 
When the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method processes an addition (`Add`), it checks if the dimensions of all terms in the addition are the same. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError`. However, this check does not account for the possibility of dimensions being equivalent, such as `velocity` and `acceleration * time`, even though they are represented differently.

To solve the issue, the method needs an enhanced way to recognize when different dimensional expressions are equivalent by evaluating their dependencies or canonical forms in the dimension system.

**Proposed Changes**:
File: `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`

1. **Enhance Dimension Equivalence Check**:
    Modify the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method to include logic for checking if dimensions are equivalent rather than strictly the same.
    
    - Update the dimension check within the `Add` case to allow for equivalent dimensions.
    - Utilize the dimension system’s internal mapping to find and confirm equivalency between different dimensions that should be considered identical.

2. **Dimension Simplification**:
    Add a step to simplify dimensions to their canonical forms before comparison. This will help in identifying dimensions that are essentially the same but represented differently.

Here's the detailed sequential plan for modifications in the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method:

1. **Initialize Dimension Mapping**:
    In the `UnitSystem` class, ensure that the dimension system's mapping correctly identifies equivalent dimensions.

2. **Simplify Dimensions Before Comparison**:
    In the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method, just before checking the dimensions, simplify all dimensions to their canonical forms.

3. **Check for Equivalence**:
    Compare the simplified dimensions rather than the raw dimensions. If they match or are equivalent, do not raise an error.

**Modifications in sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py**:
- Locate the definition for `_collect_factor_and_dimension`.
- In the section that processes an `Add`, enhance the logic to simplify and check for equivalent dimensions.

**Example code adjustment**:
Here's how the logic inside `_collect_factor_and_dimension` can be modified:

1. Import necessary functions for dimension simplification.
2. Update dimension comparison code within the `Add` check:



By implementing these changes, the method `_collect_factor_and_dimension` will be able to correctly handle and recognize equivalent dimensions in addition operations, thereby resolving the reported issue.
