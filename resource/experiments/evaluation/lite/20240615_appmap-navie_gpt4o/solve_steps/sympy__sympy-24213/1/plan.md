**Title**: Modify _collect_factor_and_dimension to Detect Equivalent Dimensions in Addition

**Problem**:
The `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in `UnitSystem` does not correctly detect equivalent dimensions when adding quantities. The provided code example demonstrates that an addition involving quantities with dimensions of velocity (`v1`) and acceleration*time (`a1 * t1`) raises a `ValueError`, indicating a mismatch in dimensions even though the dimensions are equivalent.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because `_collect_factor_and_dimension` expects all terms in an addition to have the same dimension. While this is generally correct, it fails in scenarios where different dimensional expressions are equivalent. For example, `a1 * t1` (having dimensions of acceleration*time) is dimensionally equivalent to `v1` (velocity). The method needs to account for dimensional equivalence when evaluating addition operations. This requires an enhancement to check for dimensional equivalence instead of strict equality.

**Proposed Changes**:
The solution involves modifying the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` method in the `UnitSystem` class to use dimensional equivalence rather than strict equality for the dimensions of added terms. Hereâ€™s how to achieve this:

1. **File**: `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`
    - **Function**: `_collect_factor_and_dimension`
    - **Changes**:
        1. Modify the logic in the section handling `Add` expressions to incorporate a check for dimensional equivalence. If two quantities' dimensions are found to be equivalent but not strictly equal, adjust them for comparison.
        2. Introduce a utility to check for dimension equivalence if not already available.
        3. Combine scale factors and dimensions for any valid dimensionally-equivalent terms.

### Detailed Modification Steps:
1. **Modify Function `_collect_factor_and_dimension`**:
    - Before raising a `ValueError` for dimension mismatches in addition, use the utility to check for dimension equivalence. Update dimensions to a common equivalent dimension where applicable.



2. **Utility for Dimension Equivalence**:
    - If not present, add a function within `UnitSystem` or its relevant class/utility responsible for dimension management:
    
```plaintext
- This utility will check for the equivalence of two dimensions considering their derived definitions.

3. **File**: `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`
    - Function location: Around the dimension comparison in `_collect_factor_and_dimension`.
    - Logic: Implement the described dimensional equivalence check where direct dimensional equality was previously enforced.

By following these changes, `_collect_factor_and_dimension` will handle equivalent dimensions correctly in addition operations, thereby resolving the raised issue.
