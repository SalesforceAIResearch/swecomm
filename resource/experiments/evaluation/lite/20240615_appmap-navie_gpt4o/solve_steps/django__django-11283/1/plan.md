**Title**: Modify Migration 0011_update_proxy_permissions to Handle Existing Permissions Gracefully

**Problem**: 
When upgrading to Django 2.2 and running `python manage.py migrate`, the migration `auth.0011_update_proxy_permissions` fails due to an `IntegrityError`. The error indicates that the migration attempts to insert duplicate permission entries into the `auth_permission` table, violating unique constraints.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue is that the migration does not account for the scenario where permissions for proxy models already exist in the database. The `update_proxy_model_permissions` function tries to recreate entries that might already be present, leading to a collision with existing unique constraints.

To solve this, the code should be modified to check if the permission already exists before attempting to update or insert it. Specifically:
1. Before updating permissions, verify if the permission with the same `content_type` and `codename` already exists.
2. Skip the update operation if the permissions are already correctly associated with the proxy model.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Given the context from the user's code selection, the following changes should be made in the file `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py`:

1. **Function: `update_proxy_model_permissions`**:
    - Add logic to check if a permission already exists with the specified `content_type` and `codename`.
    - If the permission already exists, skip the update operation to avoid conflicts.

Location: `django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py`

Suggested changes:
- Amend the loop that processes permissions to include a condition that skips updating/creating permissions if they already exist in the database.
- Modify queries to filter existing permissions explicitly to prevent duplicates.

Here is a detailed description of the suggested logic for the changes:

1. Modify the query to fetch existing permissions:
    - Before the `update` operation, perform a check to filter out permissions that already exist with the target content type and codename.

2. Incorporate an if-condition to bypass updates for existing permissions:
    - Inject this condition at the point where the update operations occur.

By handling the presence of existing permissions gracefully, the migration will be less likely to cause integrity errors, making the upgrade process smooth.

3. Example of logic changes:
   - Before calling `Permission.objects.filter(...).update(...)`, check if any permissions already match the conditions that would trigger a unique constraint violation. Skip or handle these cases appropriately.

These changes should ensure that the migration runs successfully without integrity errors by avoiding attempts to re-create existing permission entries.
