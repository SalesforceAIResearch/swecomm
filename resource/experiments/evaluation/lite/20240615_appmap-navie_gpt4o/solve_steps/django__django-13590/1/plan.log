**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Upgrading 2.2>3.0 causes named tuples used as arguments to __range to error.
Description
	
I noticed this while upgrading a project from 2.2 to 3.0.
This project passes named 2-tuples as arguments to range queryset filters. This works fine on 2.2. On 3.0 it causes the following error: TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'.
This happens because django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value goes into the tuple elements to resolve lookups and then attempts to reconstitute the tuple with the resolved elements.
When it attempts to construct the new tuple it preserves the type (the named tuple) but it passes a iterator to it's constructor.
NamedTuples don't have the code path for copying an iterator, and so it errors on insufficient argu... (901)
