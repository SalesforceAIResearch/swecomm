**Title**: Modify `Query.resolve_lookup_value` to Handle NamedTuples Correctly when Upgrading from Django 2.2 to 3.0

**Problem**: 
After upgrading from Django version 2.2 to 3.0, using named tuples as arguments in range queryset filters causes a `TypeError` (`__new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'`). This issue occurs because `Query.resolve_lookup_value` iterates over the elements within tuples, including named tuples, to resolve lookups. However, when it reconstructs the tuple with the resolved elements, it preserves the named tuple type but passes an iterator to its constructor. Since named tuples do not accept iterators directly, it results in the TypeError due to insufficient arguments.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue is that `Query.resolve_lookup_value` is not designed to handle named tuples properly. While it correctly processes the elements within the tuples, it does not properly reconstruct named tuples, which expect arguments to be unpacked rather than passed as an iterator. To resolve this, we need to modify the method to detect if a tuple is a named tuple and accordingly unpack the iterator values when reconstructing.

**Proposed Changes**: 
We will focus on modifying the `Query.resolve_lookup_value` function within the relevant Django module, ensuring that named tuples are properly handled. This approach involves:
1. Detecting if a tuple is a named tuple.
2. If it is a named tuple, unpacking the iterator's elements before passing them to the constructor.

**Detailed Modifications**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`
   - **Function**: `resolve_lookup_value`
   - **Changes**:
     - Add an import for `collections` to leverage `namedtuple`.
     - Modify the part of the function that processes tuples to include a check for named tuples.
     - When reconstructing the tuple, if it is a named tuple, unpack the iterator's elements using the `*` operator.

Here's a detailed description of the changes needed:

**Step-by-Step Changes**:

1. Locate the `resolve_lookup_value` function within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.

2. At the beginning of the file, add:
   

3. Within the `resolve_lookup_value` function, identify the part where tuples are processed. Modify this section to include a check for named tuples and appropriately unpack the iterator's elements when reconstructing named tuples.

   For example, in the section that handles tuples, change the reconstruction logic to:
   

This change ensures that if the tuple is a named tuple, the elements are unpacked correctly into the named tuple constructor, thus avoiding the TypeError.

By implementing the described changes, the `resolve_lookup_value` function will handle named tuples correctly when resolving lookup values in Django 3.0, maintaining compatibility with the previous behavior in Django 2.2.
