**Title**: Fix summation of all elements in the identity matrix under orthogonal assumption

**Problem**: 
The total sum of the elements of an identity matrix generated by multiplying an orthogonal matrix with its transpose is incorrectly calculated as zero instead of 'n'. This suggests a bug in the summation algorithm when handling identity matrices under given assumptions.

**Analysis**: 
The reported issue indicates a problem with the `Sum` function or related handling of assumptions, specifically when dealing with special matrices like the identity matrix. The reason the sum is zero appears to be due to the identity matrix being recognized as having all-zero elements outside the main diagonal, but an incorrect summing process fails to account for the non-zero diagonal elements correctly.

This error seems likely to originate in the summation logic within the `doit` method of matrices when assumptions are involved. Specifically, the logic fails to recognize non-diagonal elements correctly and ends up producing a zero sum.

**Proposed Changes**: 

We should focus on adjusting the summation handling in the `sympy.concrete.summations.py` file where the logic for summing all elements while respecting matrix properties and assumptions need to be corrected.

1. **sympy/concrete/summations.py**:
   - In the `doit` method handling summations, increase the sensitivity to matrix properties and assumptions.
   - Ensure that the summation logic correctly identifies and processes non-zero diagonal elements in special matrices like the identity matrix under orthogonal assumptions.

Hereâ€™s a targeted change in the `doit` method of the `Sum` class within `sympy/concrete/summations.py`:

- Update logic to correctly compute the sum for an identity matrix under orthogonal assumption:
  1. Modify the summation process to consider non-zero diagonal elements correctly.
  2. Ensure assumptions about matrix properties such as being an identity matrix are respected when computing sums.
  3. Verify and update how matrix elements are looped and summed to ensure diagonal elements are included correctly.

*For example*:
- Examine and modify where the sum is computed over all matrix elements in the method: Ensure the summation respects the identity property and avoids unnecessary simplifications which could zero out valid sums.

By implementing the above adjustments to correctly handle matrix summations under assumptions, the bug should be resolved, and the sum of all elements in the identity matrix (`n`) should be correctly calculated.
