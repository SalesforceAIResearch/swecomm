**Title**: Fix Sum Calculation for Identity Matrix Elements

**Problem**: When summing the elements of an identity matrix created using an orthogonal matrix assumption, the result is incorrectly evaluated as zero instead of 'n'.

**Analysis**: 
The issue appears to be with the behavior of the `Sum` function in handling the identity matrix generated under orthogonal matrix assumptions. Specifically, while individual elements and the sum of the diagonal elements of the identity matrix are correctly recognized, the total sum of all matrix elements evaluates to zero. This suggests that the summation logic for identity matrices needs to be adjusted to correctly account for the diagonal elements being `1` and off-diagonal elements being `0`.

The root cause is likely a discrepancy in the `doit` method of the `Sum` function when applied to identity matrices. This function properly evaluates simpler cases but fails to sum the elements across all rows and columns correctly for identity matrices.

**Proposed Changes**: 

To address the issue, the `doit` method in the `Sum` class should be modified to handle identity matrices correctly. The relevant file is `sympy/concrete/summations.py` where the `Sum` class and its methods are defined.

1. **File**: sympy/concrete/summations.py

2. **Function Modification**:
   
   - Inside the `doit` method of the `Sum` class, add a specific check for identity matrices within the summation logic.
   
   - When the function detects that it is summing the elements of an identity matrix, it should directly return `n` because an identity matrix's total sum of elements is always equal to its size (i.e., the number of rows or columns), `n`.
   
3. **Adjust `doit` Method**:
   - Identify the section of code where the summation is evaluated.
   - Add a conditional check to determine if the matrix is an identity matrix.
   - If the matrix is identified as an identity matrix, override the current summation process to return `n`.

This change should ensure that the total sum of all elements in an identity matrix is correctly evaluated as `n`.

**Detailed Steps**:

1. Open the file `sympy/concrete/summations.py`.

2. Locate the `doit` method within the `Sum` class.

3. Modify the `doit` method with the following logic:
   - Add a check to see if the function being summed is an identity matrix.
   - If true, return `n` as the sum.
   - Otherwise, proceed with the existing summation logic.

This approach ensures that the specific case of summing elements of an identity matrix is handled correctly, while not affecting the existing functionality for other summations.
