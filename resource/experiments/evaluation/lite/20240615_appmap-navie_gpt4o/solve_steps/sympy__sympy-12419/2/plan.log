**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Sum of the elements of an identity matrix is zero
I think this is a bug.

I created a matrix by M.T * M under an assumption that M is orthogonal.  SymPy successfully recognized that the result is an identity matrix.  I tested its identity-ness by element-wise, queries, and sum of the diagonal elements and received expected results.

However, when I attempt to evaluate the total sum of the elements the result was 0 while 'n' is expected.

```
from sympy import *
from sympy import Q as Query

n = Symbol('n', integer=True, positive=True)
i, j = symbols('i j', integer=True)
M = MatrixSymbol('M', n, n)

e = None
with assuming(Query.orthogonal(M)):
    e = refine((M.T * M).doit())

# Correct: M.T * M is an identity matrix.
print(e, e[0, 0], e[0, 1], e[1, 0], e[1, 1])

# Cor... (1153)
