**Title**: Fix Sum of Elements of Identity Matrix Under Orthogonal Assumption

**Problem**:
When creating a matrix \( M \) by \( M.T \times M \) under the assumption that \( M \) is orthogonal, SymPy correctly identifies the result as an identity matrix. The diagonal elements sum correctly to \( n \), but the total sum of the matrix elements erroneously evaluates to 0 instead of \( n \).

**Analysis**:
The bug arises during the summation of elements in the refined identity matrix under orthogonal assumptions. The specific issue may stem from an incorrect handling of identity matrices during the summation process in the presence of certain assumptions, causing elements that should sum to non-zero values to incorrect evaluate to zero. This points to an issue within the assumption handling logic within the matrix summation processes, specifically within the context of identity matrices derived from orthogonal matrices.

The underlying issue may involve incorrect symbolic manipulation or pattern matching in the `AskOrthogonalHandler` or the matrix summation logic, ensuring that identity matrices maintain their element values during these operations.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: sympy/assumptions/handlers/matrices.py
   - **Function**: `MatrixExpr` in `AskIdentityHandler` class
   - **Change**: Ensure that when evaluating whether a matrix is an identity matrix under the assumption that \( M \) is orthogonal, it correctly maintains its elements' values during summation.

2. **File**: sympy/concrete/summations.py
   - **Function**: `_eval_sum` in `Sum` class
   - **Change**: Verify and correct the summation logic of matrix elements, ensuring it correctly handles identity matrices even when refined under orthogonal assumptions.

**Details of Necessary Changes**:

### sympy/assumptions/handlers/matrices.py
1. `MatrixExpr` in `AskIdentityHandler` class:
   - Check and ensure identity property preservation within summation logic.
   - Adjust logic to properly identify identity matrix elements during summation operations.

### sympy/concrete/summations.py
2. `_eval_sum` method in `Sum` class:
   - Modify summation logic to ensure that symbolic identity matrix elements (specifically under orthogonal assumptions) add up correctly.
   - Ensure that the summation logic recognises and handles identity matrices correctly, preserving their element definitions when performing element-wise additions.

Addressing these changes will ensure that the identity matrix's elements sum correctly under orthogonal assumptions, resolving the erroneous summation result of 0.
