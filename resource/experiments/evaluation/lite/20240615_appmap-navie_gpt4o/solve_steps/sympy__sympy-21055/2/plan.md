**Title**: Enhance `refine()` to Simplify Complex Arguments for Real Numbers

**Problem**: The function `refine()` in the sympy library does not simplify expressions involving complex arguments under certain assumptions. For example, it should be able to recognize that `arg(a)` simplifies to 0 and `abs(a)` remains as `a` when `a` is constrained by the assumption of being positive. However, this functionality is currently missing, leading to incomplete simplification.

**Analysis**: 
The root of the issue is that there appears to be no handler in `refine()` for the `arg()` and `abs()` functions when `a` is positive. The refinement should involve:
1. Recognizing the specific function (`arg` in this case).
2. Applying the necessary simplification rules based on the given assumptions (`Q.positive(a)`).

To resolve this, we need to:
- Add dedicated handling for `arg` and similar complex functions (e.g., `abs`) within the `refine()` function.
- Ensure that when the assumptions dictate that the argument is positive (or follows a specific property), the function is simplified accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Update `refine` Handler Map**: Add entries for handling the simplification of the `arg` and `abs` functions.

2. **New Handler Functions**:
    - Implement `refine_arg` and `refine_abs` functions, similar to existing handlers like `refine_Pow`, to provide specific logic for these expressions.

3. **Modify Implementation in sympy/assumptions/refine.py**:
    - Within the `refine` function, add cases to check for `arg` and `abs`.
    - Call the appropriate handler functions when these functions are identified.

Changes:
1. **Update `handlers_dict`**:
    - Add new entries for `arg` and `abs` pointing to new handler functions.
      


2. **Implement `refine_arg` Function**:
    - Create this function to handle the simplification of the `arg` function.
    - If the assumption is that the argument is positive, return `S.Zero` for the `arg`.
    - Example logic:
      


3. **Enhance `refine_abs` Function**:
    - Modify the existing `refine_abs` function to ensure it simplifies to `arg` under the right conditions, similar to the example above for positive arguments.



4. **Integrate New Logic in `refine()`**:
    - Ensure `refine` calls these new handler functions when encountering `arg` or `abs`.

By implementing these changes, the `refine` function will correctly simplify expressions involving complex arguments under appropriate assumptions. This enhancement will allow for more accurate and expected behavior when working with complex arithmetic in sympy.
