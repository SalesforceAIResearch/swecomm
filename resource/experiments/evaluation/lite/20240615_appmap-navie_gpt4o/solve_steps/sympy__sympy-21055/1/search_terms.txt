`refine()` does not understand how to simplify complex arguments
Just learned about the refine-function, which would come in handy frequently for me.  But
`refine()` does not recognize that argument functions simplify for real numbers.

```
>>> from sympy import *                                                     
>>> var('a,x')                                                              
>>> J = Integral(sin(x)*exp(-a*x),(x,0,oo))                                     
>>> J.doit()
	Piecewise((1/(a**2 + 1), 2*Abs(arg(a)) < pi), (Integral(exp(-a*x)*sin(x), (x, 0, oo)), True))
>>> refine(J.doit(),Q.positive(a))                                                 
        Piecewise((1/(a**2 + 1), 2*Abs(arg(a)) < pi), (Integral(exp(-a*x)*sin(x), (x, 0, oo)), True))
>>> refine(abs(a),Q.positive(a))                                            
	a
>>> refine(arg(a),Q.positive(a))                                            
	arg(a)
```
I cann't find any open issues identifying this.  Easy to fix, though.
