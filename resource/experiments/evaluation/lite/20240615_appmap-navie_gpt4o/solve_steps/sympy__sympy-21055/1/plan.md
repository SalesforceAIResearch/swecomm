**Title: Enhance `refine()` to Simplify Expressions with `arg()` and `Abs()` for Real Numbers**

**Problem:**

The `refine()` function in SymPy currently does not handle the simplification of `arg()` and `Abs()` arguments when assumptions about positivity are provided. This results in expressions not being fully simplified as per the given assumptions.

**Analysis:**

The `refine()` function is designed to simplify expressions based on provided assumptions. However, it lacks specific handlers for certain complex functions like `arg()`. When providing assumptions such as `Q.positive(a)`, the `refine()` function should simplify `arg(a)` to 0 for positive real numbers and should simplify `Abs(a)` to `a` itself.

The root cause here is the missing logic for these functions within the handler dictionary or within their specific refine methods.

To resolve this, we need to:
1. Add a new handler for the `arg()` function to handle simplification under the `Q.positive` and other relevant assumptions.
2. Ensure the `abs()` function handler makes use of similar logic.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`**
   - **Function: `_eval_refine` for `arg()`**:
     - Add or update the `_eval_refine` method for the `Arg` class to simplify correctly when assumptions like `Q.positive` or `Q.nonnegative` are given.

   - **Function: `refine_abs`**:
     - Ensure that `refine_abs` function correctly simplifies `Abs` using the assumptions, especially when they indicate non-negativity.

   - **Updating the `handlers_dict`**:
     - Update the `handlers_dict` to include the new or modified handler for `arg()`.
   
2. **Details of Changes:**

   - **Update or Add `arg` Handler:**
     - Create or modify a function `refine_Arg` which will handle the `arg` refinement. This function will check the assumptions and simplify accordingly.

   - **Example Code Changes:**

     In `sympy/assumptions/refine.py`, add or update:
     
   - **Ensure `refine_abs` in `sympy/assumptions/refine.py` is updated:**

     The function already mostly covers the bases, but ensure it handles all non-negative cases clearly:
     

After implementing these changes, running:


This ensures that the expressions involving `arg()` and `Abs()` are simplified correctly under the provided assumptions.
