**Title**: Fix QuerySet.only() behavior with select_related() on reverse OneToOneField relation

**Problem**: 
In Django 4.2, when using `only()` in combination with `select_related()` on a query involving the reverse lookup of a OneToOneField relation, the generated SQL incorrectly includes all the fields from the related model, rather than only the specified ones.

**Analysis**: 
The issue appears to originate from how Django's query construction handles the `only()` function in conjunction with `select_related()`. Here is a breakdown of the problem:

1. **Model Definitions**:
   - There are two models, `Main` and `Secondary`, linked by a OneToOneField.
   - Example query: `Main.objects.select_related('secondary').only('main_field_1', 'secondary__secondary_field_1')`.

2. **Expected Result**:
   - SQL should only select specified fields from the `Main` and `Secondary` tables.

3. **Actual Result**:
   - SQL includes all fields from the `Secondary` model.

4. **Root Cause**:
   - The logic responsible for generating the SQL query does not correctly apply the field restrictions imposed by `only()` when `select_related()` is called on a OneToOneField relation.

**Proposed Changes**:
The root cause likely lies in the area of Django's query construction where `only()` and `select_related()` are combined. We need to ensure that field restrictions from `only()` are applied correctly when generating SQL with `select_related()`. I'll focus on `django/db/models/query.py`.

1. **Location**: `django/db/models/query.py`

2. **Modifications**:
   - Find the method responsible for incorporating `select_related` fields within the SQL query.
   - Adjust this logic to ensure `only()` constraints are respected, specifically for OneToOneField reverse lookups.
   - Ensure that only the specified fields from the related model are included in the SQL by refining how fields are projected in the SQL generation process.

By focusing on the necessary query construction components, we ensure that `only()` and `select_related()` work as expected, reflecting the intended field restrictions.

This plan specifies modifications within `django/db/models/query.py` to address the incorrect field inclusion in the generated SQL for queries using both `only()` and `select_related()` on OneToOneField reverse relations.
