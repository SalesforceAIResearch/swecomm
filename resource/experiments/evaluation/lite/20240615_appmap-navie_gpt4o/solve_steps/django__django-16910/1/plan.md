**Title**: Fix QuerySet.only() compatibility with select_related() for reverse OneToOneField relations

**Problem**:
In Django 4.2, calling `only()` with `select_related()` on a query using the reverse lookup for a `OneToOneField` relation does not generate the correct SQL query. All fields from the related model are still included in the generated SQL query, rather than only the specified fields. This behavior differs from Django 4.1.9, where the correct fields were selected.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue is likely to be in the logic that handles the SQL query generation for `select_related()` combined with `only()` when dealing with reverse `OneToOneField` relationships. The `only()` method restricts the columns that are loaded from the database, but the current Django 4.2 implementation does not correctly apply this restriction to related fields when `select_related()` is used.

This issue requires changes in the query construction logic to ensure that the specified fields are correctly included in the generated SQL query. Specifically, the query generation should be modified to discern between regular fields and those included in the reverse `OneToOneField` relationship and apply the `only()` restrictions appropriately.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the file `django/db/models/query.py` to adjust the query generation logic:

1. Locate the logic responsible for constructing the SQL query when `only()` is combined with `select_related()`.
2. Update this logic to correctly handle reverse `OneToOneField` relationships by ensuring that only the specified fields are included in the query.
3. Specifically:
   - Identify where `select_related` and `only` options are processed together.
   - Modify the code to respect the `only` restriction for the fields within the related `OneToOneField`.

Example of changes:

- In the `django/db/models/query.py`, locate the method where `only()` fields are applied for a `select_related` query.
- Adjust the method to check if the field belongs to a reverse `OneToOneField` relation and correctly filter it.

By making these changes, only the specified fields in `select_related` queries will be included in the SQL query, restoring the behavior to match Django 4.1.9.

**Note**: Verify these changes via local tests to confirm the correct fields are selected and ensure the changes align with the rest of the codebase without breaking existing functionalities.
