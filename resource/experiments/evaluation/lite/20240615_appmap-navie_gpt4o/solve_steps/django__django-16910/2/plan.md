**Title**: Fix `QuerySet.only()` to work correctly with `select_related()` on reverse `OneToOneField` relations.

**Problem**: 
Django 4.2 introduces a bug where using `QuerySet.only()` in combination with `select_related()` on a reverse `OneToOneField` relation does not generate the correct SQL query. Instead of selecting only the specified fields, the generated SQL query includes all fields from the related model.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem lies in the query construction mechanism for the `QuerySet` when incorporating the `only()` and `select_related()` methods. Specifically, the issue arises when dealing with the reverse `OneToOneField` relation. In Django 4.2, the query generation for `select_related()` is not properly respecting the fields limited by `only()`. This results in an SQL query that retrieves all fields from the related table, rather than just the specified ones.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/query.py`
   - Modify the logic within the `QuerySet`'s SQL query construction methods to ensure that the `only()` method correctly limits the selected fields when used with `select_related()` on reverse `OneToOneField` relations.

2. **Detailed Steps**:
   - **Step 1**: Locate the method responsible for handling `select_related()` within the `QuerySet` class.
   - **Step 2**: Adjust the method to take into account the fields specified by the `only()` call.
   - **Step 3**: Ensure that the SQL JOIN operation for `OneToOneField` respects the limited fields.
   - **Step 4**: Add or adjust conditions to prune the fields included from the related table in the SQL query based on the `only()` method's specifications.
   - **Step 5**: Implement the unit tests to verify that the changes operate correctly for both forward and reverse `OneToOneField` scenarios.

This solution entails ensuring the internal query construction respects field limitations imposed by the `only()` method, preventing extraneous data selection and maintaining optimal query efficiency. By making these adjustments, the generated SQL will correctly include only the necessary fields as specified by the user.
