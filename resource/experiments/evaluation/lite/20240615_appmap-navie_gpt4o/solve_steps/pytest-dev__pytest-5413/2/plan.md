**Title**: Modify pytest.raises context variable to match normal exception str() behavior

**Problem**: 
When using `pytest.raises` to catch an exception within a `with` block, calling `str()` on the context variable returns a different result compared to catching an exception with a regular `try ... except` block. Specifically, instead of the full error message, it returns a representation indicating where the error was raised.

**Analysis**: 
This discrepancy is due to the way `pytest.raises` encapsulates the exception in its own structure. In normal Python exception handling, calling `str()` on the exception directly yields the full error message string. However, with `pytest.raises`, the context variable is a `ExceptionInfo` object, which does not directly override the `__str__` method to return the encapsulated exception's message.

To fix this, we should adjust the `ExceptionInfo` class in `pytest` to override the `__str__` method to return the string representation of the encapsulated exception's value. This makes the behavior consistent with what users expect from standard Python exception handling.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Modify the `ExceptionInfo` class to override the `__str__` method.

1. **File**: `src/_pytest/_code/code.py`
    - Locate the `ExceptionInfo` class.
    - Add or modify the `__str__` method within this class to return the string representation of the encapsulated exception's value.

### Detailed Changes

1. **Locate `ExceptionInfo` Class**:
    - Navigate to the `src/_pytest/_code/code.py` file and find the `ExceptionInfo` class definition.

2. **Modify `__str__` Method**:
    - Ensure the `ExceptionInfo` class includes the `__str__` method which returns the string representation of its value attribute, which holds the actual exception.
    - The method should be implemented or modified as follows:



This ensures that when `str()` is called on an instance of `ExceptionInfo`, it will yield the same output as calling `str()` on the actual exception, aligning the behavior with that of standard Python exception handling.

With this change, the userâ€™s provided example will behave as expected:



By implementing these changes, we ensure consistency and eliminate the unexpected behavior which could be a potential source of confusion for users.
