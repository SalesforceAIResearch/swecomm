**Title:** Standardize `str()` Output for `pytest.raises` Context Variable

**Problem:** 
When using the `pytest.raises` context manager, calling `str()` on the captured exception context variable (`e`) does not behave the same as a typical `try-except` catch block. To obtain the full error message, one must use `str(e.value)`, which is unintuitive compared to the standard `str(e)` usage in a typical exception handling block.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of this discrepancy lies in how the `ExceptionInfo` object, which is returned by the `pytest.raises` context manager, handles string conversion. The `ExceptionInfo` object encapsulates the caught exception, but calling `str()` directly on it does not provide the same string representation as directly calling `str()` on the exception itself. Instead, `str(e)` should behave similarly to `str(e.value)` to align with user expectations and standard exception handling practices.

**Proposed Changes:**
To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `ExceptionInfo` class in the `src/_pytest/_code/code.py` file. Specifically, we should override the `__str__` method of the `ExceptionInfo` class to return the string representation of the encapsulated exception (`self.value`). Here are the detailed changes:

1. **Update the `ExceptionInfo` class to include a `__str__` method that returns the string representation of the encapsulated exception.**

_File: `src/_pytest/_code/code.py`_  
- Locate the `ExceptionInfo` class within this file.
- Add a `__str__` method to the `ExceptionInfo` class, which will return `str(self.value)`.

Detailed steps:
- Open `src/_pytest/_code/code.py`.
- Find the `ExceptionInfo` class definition.
- Add the following method to the `ExceptionInfo` class:



This change ensures that calling `str()` on the `ExceptionInfo` object returned by `pytest.raises` provides the same output as a regular exception handling block.

By implementing these changes, users will have a consistent experience when converting exceptions to strings within `pytest.raises` context managers.
