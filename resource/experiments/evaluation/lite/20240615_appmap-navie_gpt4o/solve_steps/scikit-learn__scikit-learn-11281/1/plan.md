**Title**: Harmonize Mixture Models with Clusterer API

**Problem**: Mixture models in the code base differ from typical clusterers. These differences include:
- The use of an `n_components` parameter instead of `n_clusters`.
- The absence of a `labels_` attribute to store the training data labels.
- The lack of a `fit_predict` method.

**Analysis**:
Mixture models, while probabilistic, function similarly to clusterers in that they group data points. Unifying mixture models with the clusterer interface would provide a consistent developer experience and make these models easier to use and understand.

1. **n_components vs. n_clusters**:
    - Both `n_components` in mixture models and `n_clusters` in clusterers represent the number of groups/clusters the model should identify.
    - To harmonize the interfaces, we should adopt `n_clusters` in place of `n_components`.

2. **labels_ attribute**:
    - Clusterers typically store the `labels_` of the training data, which can be useful for subsequent operations and evaluations.
    - We should introduce a `labels_` attribute in mixture models to store the respective labels after fitting the model.

3. **fit_predict method**:
    - The `fit_predict` method combines fitting the model and predicting the cluster labels. This method simplifies workflows and aligns with typical clusterer interfaces.
    - We should implement a `fit_predict` method for mixture models.

**Proposed Changes**:
The primary file for these changes will likely be where the mixture models are defined.

1. **Parameter Name Change**:
   - Identify the model class definitions for mixture models.
   - Change the parameter name from `n_components` to `n_clusters`.

2. **Introduce labels_ attribute**:
   - In the class definitions, introduce an attribute `self.labels_` to store the training data labels after fitting.
   - Modify the `fit` method to assign the predicted labels to this new `self.labels_` attribute.

3. **fit_predict Method**:
   - Implement a `fit_predict` method in the mixture models that fits the model and returns the predicted labels.

For example, if there is a class `GaussianMixture`, changes would be:

- Change the constructor to accept `n_clusters` instead of `n_components`.
- Add an attribute `self.labels_ = None`.
- Modify the `fit` method to set `self.labels_` with the predicted labels using `self.predict`.
- Add a `fit_predict` method that calls `fit` and then returns `self.labels_`.

Please make these changes in the relevant files where the mixture models are implemented.
