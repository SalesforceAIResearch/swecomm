**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Solve the problem as if you... (2655)
1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**
This is a description of the problem that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused ond describing the problem fully as a software Issue, aka Ticket.


The problem statement will be prefixed with "[problem-statement]"
1ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

The code selection will be prefixed with "[code-selection]"
1ms [prompt] system: 
Focus the plan on modifying exactly one file.

Do not modify test case files. Test case files are those that include "test", "tests" in their paths,
or match the patterns "*_test.py" or "test_*.py".

DO choose the one most relevant file to modify.
DO NOT modify any other files.
DO NOT choose a test case file.

Gaussian Mixture Model Ellipsoids
=================================

Plot the confidence ellipsoids of a mixture of two Gaussians
obtained with Expectation Maximisation (``GaussianMixture`` class) and
Variational Inference (``BayesianGaussianMixture`` class models with
a Dirichlet process prior).

Both models have access to five components with which to fit the data. Note
that the Expectation Maximisation model will necessarily use all five
components while the Variational Inference model will effectively only use as
many as are needed for a good fit. Here we can see that the Expectation
Maximisation model splits some components arbitrarily, because it is trying to

Should mixture models have a clusterer-compatible interface
Mixture models are currently a bit different. They are basically clusterers, except they are probabilistic, and are applied to inductive problems unlike many clusterers. But they are unlike clusterers in API:
* they have an `n_components` parameter, with identical purpose to `n_clusters`
* they do not store the `labels_` of the training data
* they do not have a `fit_predict` method

And they are almost entirely documented separately.

Should we make the MMs more like clusterers?
