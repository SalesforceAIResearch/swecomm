**Title**: Adapt Mixture Models to Conform to Clusterer Interface

**Problem**: 
Currently, Mixture Models (MMs) in the codebase exhibit discrepancies with typical clusterers in terms of API design. Specifically, they utilize an `n_components` parameter akin to the `n_clusters` in clusterers, do not store `labels_` of the training data, and lack a `fit_predict` method. Moreover, they are documented separately, leading to potential confusion and inconsistent usage patterns.

**Analysis**:
To address the inconsistencies between Mixture Models and clusterers, we should aim to align the interfaces and behavior of MMs with conventional clustering algorithms. This entails the following adjustments:
1. Harmonizing the parameter naming convention by introducing an alias or modifying `n_components` to `n_clusters`.
2. Ensuring that the training data's labels are stored within a `labels_` attribute after fitting, similar to how clusterers operate.
3. Implementing a `fit_predict` method in the Mixture Models to match the expected interface of clusterers.

**Proposed Changes**:
The following modifications should be performed in `sklearn/mixture/_base.py`, a file where the common functionality of Mixture Models resides:

1. **Parameter Renaming:**
    - Update the constructor to accept `n_clusters` as an alias for `n_components`. Use internal logic to ensure backward compatibility:
      

2. **Storing Training Labels:**
    - After fitting the Mixture Model, store the labels of the training data in a `labels_` attribute:
      

3. **Implementing `fit_predict` Method:**
    - Implement a `fit_predict` method within the Mixture Models that combines fitting and predicting labels in a single step:
      

These changes will make the Mixture Models more consistent with other clustering algorithms and simplify the interface for users by providing a unified API. By implementing these modifications, we will improve the usability and integration of Mixture Models within the broader clustering framework.

**Proposed Changes**:
The specific changes should be made in the following file:
File: `sklearn/mixture/_base.py`

1. **Update Constructor to Include `n_clusters` Param:**
    Modify the constructor to accept `n_clusters` and ensure backward compatibility.
    - Modify the `__init__` method to include logic for handling `n_clusters` and `n_components` parameters.

2. **Add `labels_` Attribute:**
    Store the training data's labels within the `labels_` attribute after fitting.
    - Modify the `fit` method to include storing predicted labels.

3. **Implement `fit_predict` Method:**
    Implement the `fit_predict` method to align with the clusterer interface.
    - Add the `fit_predict` method to the Mixture Model class.

These changes should be sufficient to ensure Mixture Models conform to the clusterer interface while maintaining backward compatibility and improving overall usability.
