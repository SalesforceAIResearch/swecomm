The proposed changes aim to address issues when invoking `get_backend()` in conjunction with figures created within an `rc_context`. Below are the modifications to be made in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_nbagg.py` and `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`.

### Changes

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_nbagg.py`

   - The `show()` method in the `FigureManagerNbAgg` class needs to ensure that it does not inadvertently remove figures when not in an interactive mode.

These changes ensure that figures created within an `rc_context` are handled correctly, preventing them from being removed inadvertently. This maintains the integrity of `Gcf.figs` when `get_backend()` is called.
