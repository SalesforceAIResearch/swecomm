**Title**: Fix `get_backend()` Removing Figures from `Gcf.figs` after Creating Figures in `rc_context`

**Problem**:
Calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created within an `rc_context`. This causes subsequent operations like `plt.close(fig2)` to fail because the figure cannot be found in `Gcf.figs`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the bug is likely related to the cleaning up or resetting of figures when `get_backend()` is called and the first figure was created within the `rc_context`. The `rc_context` might temporarily alter some states, which may lead to discrepancies in `Gcf.figs`.

- `rc_context` is usually used to temporarily set matplotlib's runtime configuration (rc) parameters.
- When `get_backend()` is called, it might try to reset or reinitialize some internal states.
- The interaction between `rc_context` and `get_backend()` causes all figures to be removed from `Gcf.figs`.

The appropriate location to address this issue is within the functions or mechanisms that handle `Gcf` and `get_backend()`. Ensuring figures are maintained across these operations without being cleared is crucial.

**Proposed Changes**:

**File**: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_nbagg.py` and `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`

1. **`backend_nbagg.py`**:
   - Ensure that `show()` or any related functions that deal with figures taken from `Gcf` lock their states correctly and do not get cleared upon calling `get_backend()`.

2. **`_pylab_helpers.py`**:
   - Modify the `get_backend()` function to maintain the integrity of `Gcf.figs` even when figures are created within an `rc_context`.
   - Ensure that any reset or reinitialization performed by `get_backend()` does not lead to `Gcf.figs` being cleared out.
   
### Detailed changes:

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_nbagg.py`

   - Ensure the `FigureManagerNbAgg` and `show()` method maintain figure integrity for all operations.
   - Possibly create a guard or check within the `show()` method to avoid clearing figures in `Gcf.figs`.

    - Add a check in `FigureManagerNbAgg`'s `show()` method:
        

2. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py`

    - Edit the `destroy()` method to handle contexts better and prevent clearing `Gcf.figs` unnecessarily. 

    - Add within `destroy()`, a way to handle figures created within `rc_context`:
        

In conclusion, these changes ensure that figures created within an `rc_context` are handled correctly, and calling `get_backend()` will not inadvertently clear `Gcf.figs`. This will preserve the correct behavior and prevent errors like `plt.close(fig2)` from failing due to missing figures in `Gcf.figs`.
