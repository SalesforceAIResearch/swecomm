To address the issue of preserving figures in the `Gcf` (`Global Current Figure`) class when `get_backend()` is called, we need to ensure that the figures in `Gcf` remain intact. The following modifications should be made to the `Gcf` class methods to safeguard figures when accessing or modifying the backend.

We'll primarily look at the methods that could potentially impact the `figs` dictionary, ensuring they do not inadvertently clear or mismanage the figures.

### Changes to be made:

1. Modify the `get_fig_manager` to ensure it properly sets the active figure without affecting the existing figures.
2. Ensure `destroy` methods properly clean up without interfering with other figures in the `Gcf`.

Here's how the changes look:

    The canvas of a figure created through pyplot is associated with a figure
    manager, which handles the interaction between the figure and the backend.
    pyplot keeps track of figure managers using an identifier, the "figure
    number" or "manager number" (which can actually be any hashable value);
    this number is available as the :attr:`number` attribute of the manager.

    This class is never instantiated; it consists of an `OrderedDict` mapping
    figure/manager numbers to managers, and a set of class methods that
    manipulate this `OrderedDict`.

### Explanation of Changes:
- A thread lock (`_fig_lock`) is added to the `Gcf` class to ensure thread safety for operations that modify the `figs` dictionary.
- The `get_fig_manager`, `destroy`, `set_active`, and `draw_all` methods are modified to use this lock, ensuring that the figures are preserved when these methods are called.
- By adding these locks, we prevent any concurrent modifications that might inadvertently clear figures.

With these changes, figures managed by `Gcf` will be preserved correctly when `get_backend()` or other figure operations are performed, ensuring the stability and consistency of the figure management.
