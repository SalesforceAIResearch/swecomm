**Title**: Fix `get_backend()` to Preserve Figures Created under `rc_context`

**Problem**: 
Calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure in the collection was created in an `rc_context`. This leads to a situation where subsequently created figures are not managed, causing issues with operations like `plt.close(fig)`, which relies on the figures being tracked in `Gcf`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem appears to be related to how the `get_backend()` interacts with the global figure manager (`Gcf`). `Gcf` should maintain its state, including all managed figures, regardless of the context in which the backend is queried.

The `get_backend()` function needs to ensure that figures managed by `Gcf` are not unintentionally cleared when checking or changing backend configurations, particularly when created in different contexts such as `rc_context`.

**Proposed Changes**:
The issue seems to center around how `Gcf`'s state changes related to context management. The `backend` or figure handling logic needs adjustment to ensure figures aren't improperly cleared.

1. **Matplotlib `_pylab_helpers.py`**:
   - Investigate the `Gcf` class and its methods, particularly around `get_backend`.
   - Ensure proper preservation of figures managed by `Gcf`.
   - Modify `get_backend` logic to interact correctly with `Gcf`, ensuring that the figures remain registered.

Changes should be made in the following methods and properties:
- **Method**: `get_backend()`
  - Logic should ensure that figures managed by `Gcf` remain intact regardless of the context.

Here are the necessary adjustments:

1. **lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py**:
   - Modify the method in the `Gcf` class to add additional safeguards that prevent unintentional clearing of figures when the backend is accessed or modified.

You should add checks to ensure that any modifications or interactions with `Gcf` do not inadvertently clear its `figs` attribute.
