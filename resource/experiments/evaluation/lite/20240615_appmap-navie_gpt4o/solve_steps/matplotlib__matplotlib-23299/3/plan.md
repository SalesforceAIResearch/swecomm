**Title**: Fix get_backend() to preserve figures created under rc_context in Gcf.figs

**Problem**: 
Calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` clears figures from `Gcf.figs` if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created within an `rc_context`. This results in an error where functions that rely on `Gcf.figs`, such as `plt.close()`, cannot find the figure and fail.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because `get_backend()` interacts with some state that inadvertently modifies `Gcf.figs`, particularly when the first figure in `Gcf.figs` is created under an `rc_context`. `Gcf` is responsible for managing figures created using `pyplot`. When a figure is created under an `rc_context`, its settings are temporarily modified, and this temporary context may be causing unintended side effects when `get_backend()` is called.

The root cause may be related to the reinitialization or unintentional clearing of state associated with figures when the backend is queried. Specifically, it appears that the temporary `rc_context` settings are affecting how figures are managed or stored within `Gcf`.

**Proposed Changes**:
We will focus on modifying the `_pylab_helpers.py` file because this file contains the relevant logic for managing figure contexts through the `Gcf` class. Specifically, we will adjust the `get_backend()` function to ensure that it doesn't inadvertently clear figures from `Gcf.figs`.

1. **lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py**:
   - Modify the logic within the `Gcf` class to ensure that figures are not removed from `Gcf.figs` when querying the backend.
   - Validate that `_pylab_helpers` correctly maintains its state, even when contexts are temporarily switched, such as within an `rc_context`.

Detailed steps:
1. **lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py**:
    - Ensure that `Gcf` correctly maintains its figures:
        - Review and modify methods like `get_fig_manager`, `destroy`, etc., ensuring that temporary changes in the rc context do not lead to figures being dropped.
        - Verify that `Gcf` state is preserved correctly during such transitions.

After implementing these changes, ensure to validate that calling `get_backend()` does not inadvertently clear `Gcf.figs`, even when figures are created under different contexts.

By making these changes, the `get_backend()` can be invoked without clearing figures from `Gcf.figs`, ensuring consistent behavior and addressing the bug.
