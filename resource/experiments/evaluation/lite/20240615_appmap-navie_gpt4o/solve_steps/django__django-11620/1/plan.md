### Display Detailed Error Message for Http404 in Path Converter When DEBUG is True

**Problem**
When `DEBUG` is `True` in a Django project and an `Http404` exception is raised within a path converter's `to_python` method, the resulting error message is not helpful. Instead of receiving a technical response, users get a plain text message: "A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator." This behavior does not aid in debugging URL resolution issues effectively. The desired behavior is for a detailed error message to be displayed, just like when a `ValueError` is raised.

**Analysis**
In development mode (`DEBUG=True`), Django should display a technical error page with detailed information when an `Http404` exception is raised in a path converter's `to_python` method. This would help developers understand what went wrong during URL resolution. The core of the issue is that path converters need to provide more context-specific feedback when an `Http404` is raised.

Currently, the `to_python` method in converters raises an `Http404` that is not handled in a way that provides a useful technical response. Instead, Django treats it like a generic server error. Modifying the URL resolver to handle `Http404` exceptions raised within path converters differently when `DEBUG` is `True` can address this issue.

**Proposed Changes**
1. **File**: `django/urls/resolvers.py`
    - **Function**: `resolve`
        - Modify the `resolve` method to handle `Http404` exceptions raised by path converters. Add logic to check if `DEBUG` is `True` and then format a detailed error message accordingly.
        - Specifically, update the error handling to differentiate between an `Http404` raised inside a converter's `to_python` method and other locations, providing relevant debug information.

**Detailed Description of Changes**

In the `resolve` method of `URLResolver` class within `django/urls/resolvers.py`:

1. **Locate the error handling section**:
    - Find the section where `Resolver404` exceptions are being handled and examined for potential patterns that caused the error.
   
2. **Modify the error handling logic**:
    - Add logic to specifically handle `Http404` exceptions differently when they are raised within the `to_python` method of converters.
    - Ensure that when `DEBUG` is `True`, the `Http404` raises a comprehensive technical error page instead of a plain message.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
    - Check if the `DEBUG` setting is `True`. If so, customize the `Http404` handler within the `resolve` method to collect and display more detailed information, including the exception type, the converter used, and the offending parameter value.
    - Make sure this detailed information is included in the error message, and provide traceback and other context useful for debugging.

Such modifications within the `resolve` function in `django/urls/resolvers.py` will address the core issue and will help in providing a more useful error message during development.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of the changes needed to `resolve` method in `django/urls/resolvers.py`:

1. **Locate the `resolve` method in `django/urls/resolvers.py`**:
2. **Update the exception handling inside the `resolve` function** to check if the raised exception is an `Http404` and if it occurred within the `to_python` method of a path converter.
3. **Enhance the error message** to include more detailed context when `DEBUG` is `True`.

These changes ensure that when `DEBUG` is enabled, raising an `Http404` within a path converter's `to_python` method results in a detailed error message that aids in debugging the issue effectively.
