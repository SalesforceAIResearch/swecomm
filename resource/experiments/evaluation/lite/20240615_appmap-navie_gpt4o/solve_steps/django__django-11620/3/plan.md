**Title**: Modify path converter's to_python method to correctly raise ValueError on non-matching paths and improve Http404 handling during DEBUG mode

**Problem**: 
When `DEBUG` is `True` and `Http404` is raised inside a path converter’s `to_python` method, it does not result in a technical response with a detailed error message. Instead, it gives a generic error response: "A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator." The expected behavior should involve raising a `ValueError` for the URL resolver to understand "this path does not match, try the next one". Alternatively, if `Http404` is raised, the response should include a helpful error message during `DEBUG` mode.

**Analysis**:
The core issue stems from an incorrect handling of raised exceptions within the path converter’s `to_python` method. Raising `Http404` in this context is intuitively seen as a way to handle non-matching paths but it should rightly be `ValueError`. Furthermore, there should be a mechanism to catch `Http404` and provide more detailed debug information if `DEBUG` mode is enabled. This dual approach ensures that incorrect paths are correctly flagged, and detailed error messages are provided during development (debug mode).

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Modify the `to_python` Method of Path Converters**:
   - Update the `to_python` method to raise `ValueError` for indicating non-matching paths.
   - Ensure it catches potential `Http404` raised from common methods like `get_object_or_404` and handles it appropriately.

2. **Enhance Debug Response Handling**:
   - Update the response handling logic to include detailed error messages when `Http404` is raised, but only when `DEBUG` mode is `True`.
   - Modify the resolver to provide more granular debug information when these exceptions occur.

**Specific File Changes**:

1. **`django/urls/converters.py`:** 
   - Update the relevant `to_python` methods (such as those in custom converters or extend the base converters) to raise `ValueError` for non-matching paths.
   - Capture `Http404` and raise it conditionally based on whether `DEBUG` is `True`.

   

2. **`django/urls/resolvers.py`**:
   - Enhance the error handling to produce more detailed debug information when `Http404` is caught and `DEBUG` is `True`.

   

By implementing these changes, you can ensure that during development, detailed error messages are provided, leading to a more efficient debugging process, while maintaining the correct behavior of the URL resolver with respect to non-matching path handling.
