Handle Http404 in Path Converter Correctly when DEBUG is True

### Problem

When `DEBUG` is set to `True`, raising an `Http404` in a path converter's `to_python` method does not result in a technical response. Instead, a plain text message "A server error occurred. Please contact the administrator." is displayed. This behavior is not intuitive, as raising `Http404` should ideally let the resolver know that the current path's parameter value does not match and should stop further processing to return a helpful error message.

Raising a `Http404` should inform the resolver that the path is technically correct, but the parameter value does not match any known entity, thereby helping to implement a path converter that uses `get_object_or_404`.

### Analysis

The current behavior is rooted in how the Django resolver handles exceptions raised during the URL resolution process. The `to_python` method in path converters is designed to convert the path segment into a Python object. If this conversion fails, it raises a `ValueError`. However, in this case, we wish to raise an `Http404` to indicate that the path is correct but the parameter value does not match any valid object.

To resolve this, the resolver should be updated to catch `Http404` exceptions in the same way it handles `ValueError`, but with additional behavior to render a technical error page when `DEBUG` is `True`.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Update `resolve` method in the resolver:**

   **File**: `django/urls/resolvers.py`

   **Location**: Function `resolve`, around lines 534-554

   **Changes**:
   - Modify the existing exception handling to catch the `Http404` exception raised within the `to_python` method of the path converters.
   - When `DEBUG` is `True`, render a detailed technical error page instead of a generic server error message.

   **Detailed Changes**:
   - Add an additional exception handler for `Http404`.
   - In the `Http404` exception handler block, check if `DEBUG` is `True`. If so, render a technical error page that shows the converter and the value that caused the failure.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Modify `resolve` method in `django/urls/resolvers.py`:**
    - Enhance the exception handling to catch `Http404`.
    - Ensure detailed debug information is provided when `DEBUG` is `True`.

### Suggested Changes:

1. **django/urls/resolvers.py**:
    - In the `resolve` function, add an exception handling block for `Http404`. When caught, render a technical error page if `DEBUG` is enabled, with appropriate information about the failure.

By performing these changes, the behavior will be aligned more intuitively, allowing the `Http404` to signify a specific type of failure in the path converter and making debugging easier when `DEBUG` is `True`.
