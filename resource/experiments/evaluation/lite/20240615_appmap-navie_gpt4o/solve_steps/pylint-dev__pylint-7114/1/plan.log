**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

2ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**
This is a description of the problem that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused ond describing the problem fully as a software Issue, aka Ticket.


The problem statement will be prefixed with "[problem-statement]"
2ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

DO choose the one most relevant file to modify.
DO NOT modify any other files.
DO NOT choose a test case file.

Linting fails if module contains module of the same name
### Steps to reproduce

Given multiple files:
```
.
`-- a/
    |-- a.py
    `-- b.py
```
Which are all empty, running `pylint a` fails:

```
$ pylint a
************* Module a
a/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file a/__init__.py:
[Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'a/__init__.py' (parse-error)
$
```

However, if I rename `a.py`, `pylint a` succeeds:

```
$ mv a/a.py a/c.py
$ pylint a
$
```
Alternatively, I can also `touch a/__init__.py`, but that shouldn't be necessary anymore.

### Current behavior

Running `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present fails while searching for an `__init__.py` file.

### Expected behavior

Running `pylint a` if `a/a.py` is present should succeed.
