### Title
Fix module parsing to handle directories with modules of the same name

### Problem
Running `pylint` fails when a directory contains a module with the same name as the directory itself. Specifically, if such a module is present, `pylint` fails because it cannot find the `__init__.py` file in the directory. This issue causes module resolution to be incorrect, leading to errors in other unrelated modules.

### Analysis
The root cause of this issue lies in how modules and packages are parsed and resolved within the `pylint` tool. When a directory name matches a module name within it, `pylint` seems to incorrectly handle the package structure, expecting an `__init__.py` file that doesn't exist.

The expected behavior is that `pylint` should handle such cases gracefully, treating the directory as a package even if an `__init__.py` file is not present (as per newer Python standards). This would allow `pylint` to recognize and properly lint the modules within that directory without requiring an `__init__.py` file.

The logic for scanning directories and determining package membership appears to reside within module inspection and parsing functions, particularly those related to building a project from a set of files.

### Proposed Changes
We should modify the `project_from_files` function in `pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py` to handle cases where the package directory name matches a module name within it without requiring an `__init__.py` file.

1. **File:** `pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py`
    - **Function:** `project_from_files`
    - **Change:**
        - After determining the file path (`fpath`) for a given module or directory, check if the path corresponds to a directory.
        - If it is a directory and has no `__init__.py` file, still consider it as a package directory and continue with the process.
    
This change will allow `pylint` to treat such directories correctly without failing due to the missing `__init__.py` file, thereby fixing the current issue with module resolution.

### Detailed Modification Steps
1. **File**: `pylint/pyreverse/inspector.py`
    - **Locate** the `project_from_files` function.
    - **Modify** the code block that handles file paths and package detection.

    Specifically, change the following:

    

    To:

    

    This change will check if a directory exists without an `__init__.py` file and handle it accordingly.

2. **Ensure** that the `ast` object is not discarded if its corresponding file path is a directory without an `__init__.py` file. This allows for package-level processing even when `__init__.py` is absent.

By implementing these changes, `pylint` will more robustly handle directories named after modules within them, aligning it with modern Python packaging practices. Running `pylint` on such structures will no longer result in parse errors due to missing `__init__.py` files.

This modification should address the issue and ensure both improved stability and compatibility with evolving Python packaging standards.
