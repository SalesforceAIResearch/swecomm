### Title

Fix module resolution failure when `a.py` is present in `a/` directory

### Problem

When running `pylint` on a directory containing a sub-module with the same name as a file (e.g., `a/a.py`), `pylint` fails with a parse-error, searching for an `__init__.py` that does not exist. The issue is masked if you rename the sub-module file `a.py` or add an `__init__.py` file to the directory, but these shouldn't be necessary.

### Analysis

The root cause of this issue lies in how `pylint` currently handles module resolution, where it assumes that for any directory, an `__init__.py` file must be present to correctly parse the directory as a package. In cases where the directory-containing modules have files sharing their names (e.g., a module `a` containing `a.py`), the importer logic fails to correctly recognize the structure, leading to parse errors.

### Proposed Changes

**File to be changed**: `pylint/pyreverse/diagrams.py`

The modifications focus on adjusting how `pylint` handles the omission of `__init__.py`. We need to update the `get_module` method to handle such cases without raising an error. 

1. **Update the `get_module` method**:
   - Ensure that the logic accounts for files having the same name as the module without raising a parse error if `__init__.py` is missing.

Detailed proposed changes:





#### Private helper methods to be added:
- `_is_present_as_file_only`: Check if a module name corresponds to a file directly.
- `_create_package_entity_for_file_only`: Create a `PackageEntity` for file-only modules.

By modifying the `get_module` method, we ensure that `pylint` can handle packages with file-only modules more gracefully, avoiding unnecessary parse errors that currently occur due to missing `__init__.py`.

### Summary

This change will make `pylint` more robust in recognizing packages and modules in setups where files share names with directories and might be missing `__init__.py` files. This ensures smoother module resolution and reduces false errors in linting scenarios.
