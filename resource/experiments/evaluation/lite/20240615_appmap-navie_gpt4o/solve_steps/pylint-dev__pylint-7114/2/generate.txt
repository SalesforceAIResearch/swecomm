**Title**: Correct module resolution when a module contains a submodule with the same name

**Problem**:
Running `pylint a` fails when the directory `a` contains a file named `a.py` but no `__init__.py` file. The error indicates that `pylint` is looking for `a/__init__.py`, which does not exist. This issue causes further complications in module resolution, leading to linting errors even in unrelated files when `pylint` is run on multiple modules together.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem is that `pylint` relies on the presence of an `__init__.py` file to recognize directories as packages. Without this file, `pylint` cannot correctly resolve the module hierarchy, hence the failure when encountering a directory and a file with the same name.

In this specific case, running `pylint` on a directory named `a` which also contains an `a.py` file but lacks an `a/__init__.py` file results in a module resolution failure. Here, `pylint` wrongly attempts to find and parse `a/__init__.py`.

**Proposed Changes**:
To resolve this issue, modify the logic responsible for module discovery and resolution within the `pylint` codebase to handle the case where a directory and a file share the same base name, but the directory lacks an `__init__.py`. One approach is to avoid assuming the presence of an `__init__.py` and handle it more gracefully.

**File to Modify**: `pylint/lint/__init__.py`

1. **Update module discovery logic**:
   - In the section of code where `pylint` scans directories for modules, modify the logic to allow directories without `__init__.py` files to be recognized as packages if they contain Python files.

2. **Handle special case for module resolution**:
   - Ensure that `pylint` correctly resolves modules even when conflicting with file names. This could involve additional checks to identify and correctly handle such scenarios, possibly by ordering checks to prioritize files over directories or vice versa, as appropriate.

3. **Improve error handling for missing `__init__.py`**:
   - Modify error messages and handling to provide clearer guidance or to bypass looking for `__init__.py` in directories that already have Python files that can define modules.

### Detailed Change Suggestions:

- **pylint/lint/__init__.py**:
  - In the function responsible for loading modules (likely something akin to `load_modules` or `discover_modules`):
    1. Add logic to explicitly check for conflicts between filenames and directory names without relying strictly on the presence of `__init__.py`.
    2. Modify any exception handling related to module imports to account for and manage these conflicts gracefully.
   
   Example of what to modify:
   - Identify where `pylint` iterates through the directory contents.
   - After identifying a directory, check if it shares the name with a file in the same directory and handle loading accordingly by adjusting how the module path is formed.

This approach maintains the robustness of `pylint`'s module resolution and avoids unnecessary failures due to missing `__init__.py` files in these edge cases. The specific logic will involve detailed navigation and updates within the identified function to balance directory and file-based module resolution.
