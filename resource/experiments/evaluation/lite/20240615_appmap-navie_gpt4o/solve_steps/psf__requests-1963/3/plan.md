**Title:** Fix Incorrect Method Selection in `Session.resolve_redirects` for 303 and 307 Status Codes

**Problem:**
`Session.resolve_redirects` currently copies the original request for all subsequent requests during redirection. This behavior can lead to incorrect HTTP method selection. For instance, when encountering a 303 See Other status, the original POST request may incorrectly be preserved as a POST instead of being converted to a GET, as intended by the 303 redirect. Further redirections (like 307 Temporary Redirect) should maintain the correct HTTP method from the previous redirection, not revert to the original method.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue lies in how the `resolve_redirects` method initializes each new request during the redirect handling. The method currently initializes each new request by copying the original request, which causes incorrect method selection in complex redirection chains like the provided example.

A 303 See Other status code explicitly requires the subsequent request to be a GET, regardless of the original method. On encountering a 307 Temporary Redirect, the method should remain the same as the one used just before the redirection, not the original one.

To fix this, the logic in `resolve_redirects` needs to be modified so that it correctly handles the redirection as per RFC specifications, particularly for 303 and 307 status codes.

**Proposed Changes:**
Adjust the `resolve_redirects` method located in `requests/sessions.py` to ensure that the HTTP method is set correctly according to the specific redirect status codes.

1. **Track the Current Request Method:**
   - Add logic to store the current request method before each redirection.
   - If the redirection status is 303, ensure the subsequent request method is always set to GET.
   - For a 307 status, ensure the subsequent request maintains the method used just before the redirection.

2. **Modify the `resolve_redirects` Method in `requests/sessions.py`:**
   - Update lines within the `while resp.is_redirect:` loop to track and update the HTTP method according to the redirection status code.
   
**Example of the Required Changes:**
- Update the method signature and the loop logic to handle these cases appropriately.

* In `requests/sessions.py`:

  

This change will ensure that the correct HTTP method is used after each redirection, obeying the semantics of the specific HTTP status codes, thus resolving the issue.

These modifications ensure that the redirection handling logic accurately respects the intentions of HTTP status codes like 303 and 307, preventing incorrect method selection in complex redirection scenarios.
