Based on the issue description, we need to modify the `resolve_redirects` method in `requests/sessions.py` to handle HTTP status codes 303 and 307 correctly. Specifically, the subsequent request should be converted to a GET request for 303 status and retain the current method for 307 status during redirection.

Here's the required change applied to the file `requests/sessions.py`:

```

These changes ensure that the correct HTTP method is set according to the redirection status code while handling redirection in `resolve_redirects`. The method will be correctly set to `GET` for status code 303 and the last-used method will be preserved for status code 307.
