**Title**: Fix `Session.resolve_redirects` to Preserve HTTP Method After Intermediary Redirects

**Problem**: 
The `Session.resolve_redirects` method in the `requests` library encounters an issue where the original request is copied for each subsequent request in a redirection chain. This behavior can disrupt the correct HTTP method selection, especially when intermediary 303 responses convert a POST to a GET. In such a scenario, subsequent redirects should preserve the changed method (GET), but the current implementation reverts to the original method (POST), causing an incorrect request.

**Analysis**: 
The problem is rooted in `Session.resolve_redirects`, which copies the original request at the beginning of each iteration in its while loop. Consequently, redirects that should alter the method (like 303, which changes POST to GET) get overridden in subsequent redirects, resulting in incorrect HTTP methods. The fix involves ensuring that the method used in subsequent requests is carried forward from the previous response rather than reverting to the original request method.

To correct this behavior, we need to modify `resolve_redirects` such that it uses the HTTP method of the last response in the chain when handling further redirects. Specifically, when an HTTP status code that mandates a change in the request method is encountered (like 303), we should update the method for subsequent requests accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `resolve_redirects` method in `requests/sessions.py`:
    - Track the current request method and update it in the loop based on the response status.
    - Ensure subsequent redirects use the updated method instead of the original request method.

Here is the detailed description of changes required within that file:

1. `requests/sessions.py`:
    - Location: `requests/sessions.py:83-107`
        - Within the `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` method.
        - Introduce a variable to keep track of the current request method.
        - Update this variable based on the response status code before preparing subsequent requests.

Specific Changes:
- Introduce a variable `current_method` to track the HTTP method used.
- Initially, set `current_method` to the method of the original request.
- Inside the loop, before preparing a new request, update `current_method` based on the previous response's redirect status.
- Use `current_method` instead of `req.method` while preparing the new request.

This approach ensures that the HTTP method is preserved correctly throughout the redirection chain, addressing the issue described.

Once these changes are implemented, thoroughly test the redirection handling by crafting test cases with various sequences of redirects, particularly those involving 303 and 307 status codes, to confirm the fix.
