**Title: Modify `Session.resolve_redirects` to Maintain Correct HTTP Method Across Redirects**

**Problem:**
In the current implementation of `Session.resolve_redirects`, the original request object is copied for each subsequent redirection. This can lead to incorrect HTTP methods being used in the redirect chain. Specifically, if a `POST` request receives a `303 See Other` response and correctly converts to a `GET`, a subsequent `307 Temporary Redirect` should preserve the `GET`. However, because the method currently copies the original request, the subsequent `307` redirect incorrectly uses `POST` instead of `GET`.

**Analysis:**
The issue lies in how the redirect handling logic copies the `original` request object at each iteration, rather than starting with a modified request which reflects the HTTP method transformations caused by previous redirects:
1. When `resolve_redirects` processes a `303 See Other` response, it should convert the request method from `POST` to `GET`.
2. For subsequent redirects (e.g., `307 Temporary Redirect`), it must use the method modified by the previous redirect (`GET` in this case, not reverting back to `POST`).

The solution involves ensuring the request object used in redirects reflects any changes from prior redirects.

**Proposed Changes:**
Only file `requests/sessions.py` is directly relevant for these changes:

1. Modify `Session.resolve_redirects` to correctly handle the method transformations:
    - Track the current prepared request method.
    - Update the method based on the type of redirect received.

**Detailed Changes:**

1. **In `requests/sessions.py`:**
    - In the `SessionRedirectMixin` class:
        - Update the `resolve_redirects` method to avoid copying the original request method for each redirect iteration. Instead, adjust the method according to the received redirect status.

Detailed instructions:
- Within the `resolve_redirects` method:
    - After determining the new URL and before preparing the new request, add logic to set the correct HTTP method based on the type of redirect:
      - If `status_code` is `303`, set the method to `GET`.
      - If `status_code` is `307`, keep the current method as it is.
    - Ensure that the modified method is used in the subsequent redirects.
      
2. **Implementation Steps:**
    - At the beginning of the while loop in `resolve_redirects`, replace the method setting logic to ensure it reflects the last used method, not just the original method.

Post these changes, the method used in subsequent requests following redirects will correctly respect the HTTP method transformations expected due to specific status codes, ensuring compliance with HTTP standards for handling redirects.
