**Title**: Sanitize Username When Creating Temporary Directories in TempPathFactory

**Problem**: 
tmpdir creation fails when the username contains illegal characters for directory names. This occurs because the `getpass.getuser()` function may return a username with characters not allowed in directory names, such as backslashes (`\`) or other special characters typically found in domain usernames. This issue was reproduced in a Windows environment, particularly through an SSH connection where the domain username includes backslashes.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the issue is the direct use of `getpass.getuser()` to create names for temporary directories without sanitizing the username. When `getpass.getuser()` includes characters that are illegal for directory names, the creation of these directories will fail, as seen in the error traceback. To resolve the issue, we need to sanitize the username returned by `getpass.getuser()` before using it to create directory paths. This can be done by removing or replacing illegal characters in the username.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **sanitize_username Function**:
    - Create a helper function `sanitize_username` that will clean the username by removing or replacing characters that are not allowed in directory names.
2. **Update get_user Function**:
    - Modify the `get_user` function to use the new `sanitize_username` helper function before returning the username.
3. **Update TempPathFactory Initialization**:
    - Use the sanitized username when setting up the base temporary directory in the `TempPathFactory` class.

### Changes in `src/_pytest/tmpdir.py`

1. **Create sanitize_username Function**:
   - Add a function that takes a username string as input and returns a sanitized version with illegal characters removed or replaced.
   - Suggested location for this function is near the top of the file, after imports.

2. **Modify get_user Function**:
   - Modify the existing `get_user` function to use the `sanitize_username` function before returning the username.

3. **Update TempPathFactory Initialization**:
   - In the `TempPathFactory` class (inside `getbasetemp` method), use the sanitized username when creating directory paths to avoid illegal characters issues.

#### Detailed Description of Changes:

1. **src/_pytest/tmpdir.py** (at the top, after imports):
   
   Function: `sanitize_username`
   - Logic: Replace any characters not allowed in directory names with an underscore or remove them.

2. **src/_pytest/tmpdir.py** (modify the get_user function):

   - Modify the `get_user` function to sanitize the username.
     
   Function: `get_user`
   - Logic: Update to call `sanitize_username(user)` before returning the username.

3. **src/_pytest/tmpdir.py** (inside the TempPathFactory class):

   - Update the `getbasetemp` method to use sanitized usernames.
     
   Method: `TempPathFactory.getbasetemp`
   - Logic: Use the `sanitize_username` to clean the username before using it in the path.

With these changes, the username used in creating temporary directories will be sanitized, preventing the error encountered when the username contains illegal characters for directory names.
