**Title**: Add `make_hashable` Call to `through_fields` in `ManyToManyRel` for Consistent Hashability

**Problem**: 
When using the `ManyToManyRel` class in Django, the `through_fields` attribute can sometimes be a list, causing a `TypeError` during hash operations due to the unhashable `list` type. This issue is only triggered under specific conditions, such as when checking proxy models, which leads to inconsistent behavior and raises the exception: `TypeError: unhashable type: 'list'`.

**Analysis**:
The `identity` property within the `ManyToManyRel` class constructs a tuple that includes various attributes, including `through_fields`. To ensure that this tuple remains hashable, all its elements need to be hashable. Django already uses a utility function `make_hashable` to convert non-hashable items (like lists) into a hashable format. However, the current implementation of the `identity` property does not apply `make_hashable` to `through_fields`, leading to the aforementioned `TypeError`.

To address this issue, the `make_hashable` function should be applied to `self.through_fields` within the `identity` property of the `ManyToManyRel` class. This will ensure that even when `through_fields` is a list, the entire `identity` tuple remains hashable.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `identity` property in the `ManyToManyRel` class to include a call to `make_hashable` on `self.through_fields`. 

In the file `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`, make the following change:

1. Locate the `identity` property in the `ManyToManyRel` class.
2. Apply the `make_hashable` function to `self.through_fields`.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
- In `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`, within the `ManyToManyRel` class:
  - Adjust the `identity` property to include the `make_hashable` call for `self.through_fields`.

By making these changes, you ensure that any instances of `through_fields`, whether lists or other types, are converted to a hashable format, thereby preventing the `TypeError` during hash operations.

**Modification Summary**:
- File: `django/db/models/fields/reverse_related.py`
  - Locate the `identity` property within the `ManyToManyRel` class.
  - Modify the `identity` property to call `make_hashable` on `self.through_fields`.

This fix will ensure that the `identity` property remains consistently hashable, thus avoiding the `TypeError` and maintaining stability and predictability in operations involving `ManyToManyRel`.
