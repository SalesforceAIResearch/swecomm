**Title**: Reorder `args` list in `DatabaseClient` to pass additional parameters before `dbname` in PostgreSQL client

**Problem**: 
When invoking `./manage.py dbshell -- -c "select * from some_table;"`, PostgreSQL's `psql` command expects all options to precede the database name. However, the current implementation appends additional parameters after the database name, causing `psql` to ignore these parameters.

**Analysis**:
In PostgreSQL's command-line interface (`psql`), options must appear before the database name. If options appear after the database name, `psql` will treat them as extra arguments and issue warnings. The root cause is the sequence in which the `args` list is constructed in the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method of the `DatabaseClient` class for PostgreSQL. Therefore, the solution is to ensure that additional parameters are rearranged to appear before the database name in the `args` list.

**Proposed Changes**:

- Modify the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method of the `DatabaseClient` class in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **File**: `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`

   1.1. Locate the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method. Adjust the construction of the `args` list to ensure the database name (`dbname`) appears last after all options and parameters.

   

   1.2. The specific part to be modified is the sequence of element addition to the `args` list:
   
   - Collect all options (`-U`, `-h`, `-p`) in `args` list.
   - Append the database name (`dbname`).
   - Extend the list with additional parameters provided via the command line.

   #### Example Guidance (Do not include code snippets, but explain changes):
   
   - Initialize the `args` list with executable name and options.
   - Use conditions to append user, host, and port flags in the required order.
   - Append `dbname` at the end of the `args` list.
   - Finally, extend `args` with `parameters`.



With these changes, the database name will appear after all the options and before the additional parameters, aligning with `psql`'s expected argument sequence.
