**Title**: Add Hostname and Timestamp to JUnit XML Reports in pytest

**Problem**:
The generated JUnit XML reports from pytest are missing the `hostname` and `timestamp` properties in the `testsuite` XML element. These properties are useful for tracking and identifying test environments and the time when the tests were executed.

**Analysis**:
To include the `hostname` and `timestamp` properties in the JUnit XML report, modifications are necessary in the code that generates the XML report. The relevant class for generating the JUnit XML report and adding these attributes is typically responsible for defining the structure of the XML and populating it with relevant data.

The solution involves:
1. Fetching the current hostname of the machine running the tests.
2. Getting the current timestamp when the tests are executed.
3. Including these new properties (`hostname` and `timestamp`) in the `testsuite` XML element.

We should modify the section of the code responsible for creating the `testsuite` node in the XML report, adding the `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes.

**Proposed Changes**:
**File**: `src/_pytest/junitxml.py` (assuming file based on standard pytest practices for JUnit XML report generation)

1. **Import required modules**: We need the `socket` and `datetime` modules to fetch the hostname and current timestamp.
2. **Include properties in the XML generation logic**:
    - Locate the function or method that generates the `testsuite` XML element.
    - Modify it to include `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes.

**Detailed Changes**:

1. **Import necessary libraries** at the beginning of the file:

    

2. **Modify the function** responsible for creating the `testsuite` XML element:

    Find the section of code that creates the `testsuite` element and add the relevant attributes:

    - **Before** the modification:
        

    - **After** the modification:
        

This ensures that the JUnit XML generated by pytest includes both the hostname and timestamp attributes, formatted according to ISO 8601.

**Summary**:
By following the proposed changes, the `testsuite` elements within the JUnit XML reports will include the `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes, enhancing the traceability and contextual information of the test execution environment.
