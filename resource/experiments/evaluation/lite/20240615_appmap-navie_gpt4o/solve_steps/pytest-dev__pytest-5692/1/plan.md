### Add `hostname` and `timestamp` properties to generated JUnit XML reports

#### Problem
Currently, `hostname` and `timestamp` properties are missing from the `testsuite` element in the JUnit XML reports generated by pytest. These properties are essential for certain CI/CD systems and for better traceability and auditing of test results.

#### Analysis
To resolve this issue, we need to enhance the JUnit XML generation logic to include `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes. The `hostname` can be obtained using Python's `socket` module, and the `timestamp` can be derived using the `datetime` module.

The relevant file for changes is the one responsible for producing the JUnit XML report in pytest. From the provided code snippets, the most likely file for housing the JUnit generation logic appears to be within the `src/_pytest/reports.py` file. 

#### Proposed Changes
Modify the function responsible for generating the XML for `testsuite` within `src/_pytest/reports.py` to include the `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes.

1. **Import Necessary Modules:**
   - Import `socket` to retrieve the hostname.
   - Import `datetime` to generate the current timestamp.

2. **Retrieve Hostname and Timestamp:**
   - Use `socket.gethostname()` to get the hostname.
   - Use `datetime.datetime.now().isoformat()` to get the current timestamp in ISO format.

3. **Include Attributes in the XML Generation:**
   - Modify the XML generation code to include the `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes in the `testsuite` element.

Details of changes:

1. **Import Modules:**
   - Add `import socket`
   - Add `from datetime import datetime`

2. **Retrieve the hostname and timestamp:**
   - Inside the function generating the `testsuite` element, obtain the hostname using `socket.gethostname()`
   - Get the current timestamp using `datetime.now().isoformat()`

3. **Include in XML:**
   - Modify the `testsuite` element to include `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes.

#### Changes in `src/_pytest/reports.py`

- Include imports:
  

- Modify the XML generation logic:
  

This update ensures that the generated JUnit XML reports will now include the `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes in the `testsuite` element to enhance traceability and compatibility with various CI/CD systems.
