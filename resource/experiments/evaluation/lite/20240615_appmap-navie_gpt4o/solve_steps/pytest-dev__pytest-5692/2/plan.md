**Title**: Include `hostname` and `timestamp` properties in generated JUnit XML reports

**Problem**: 
The generated JUnit XML reports by pytest are missing `hostname` and `timestamp` properties in the `testsuite` XML element.

**Analysis**: 
JUnit XML reports generated by pytest do not currently include `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes in the `testsuite` element, which prevents users from having complete metadata in their test reports. These properties are standard in JUnit XML reports produced by other test frameworks, and their absence may limit some use cases, like detailed test archiving and analysis.
 
To solve this, the changes required involve:
- Capturing the hostname of the machine on which the tests are being run.
- Capturing the timestamp when the testsuite starts.
- Modifying the `testsuite` node generation to include these properties.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Capture Hostname and Timestamp:** 
   - Modify the `LogXML` class to capture the hostname and timestamp when the test suite starts.
   - Capture the timestamp in the `pytest_sessionstart` method.
   - Capture the hostname using Python's `socket` module inside the `__init__` method of the `LogXML` class.

2. **Add Hostname and Timestamp to Testsuite:**
   - Modify the `LogXML` class where the `testsuite` node is generated to include the captured hostname and timestamp.

**Specific Code Changes**:
- **File**: `src/_pytest/junitxml.py`
  - In the `LogXML` class's `__init__` method, initialize attributes `self.hostname` and `self.timestamp`.
  - Use the `socket` module to capture the hostname.
  - In the `pytest_sessionstart` method, capture the start timestamp.
  - Modify the `Junit.testsuite` call to include `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes.

Specifically:
1. Modify the `__init__` of `LogXML` to initialize `hostname` and `timestamp`.
2. Update `pytest_sessionstart` to store the start timestamp.
3. Extend the `Junit.testsuite` call to add `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes from `self.hostname` and `self.timestamp`.

This ensures the generated JUnit XML report includes both `hostname` and `timestamp` attributes, providing users with complete and informative test suite metadata.
