**Title:** Remove caching for condition evaluation in mark decorators to ensure correct behavior

**Problem:** The current implementation of pytest caches the evaluation of string conditions used in decorators like `@pytest.mark.skipif` and `@pytest.mark.xfail`. The cache key is only the string itself, without considering the item's globals. This can lead to incorrect evaluations when running tests from different modules that have the same condition string but different global contexts. For example, using the same condition string `"skip"` but with different values in different modules causes all tests to be skipped if one condition is met, due to caching.

**Analysis:** The root cause of the issue is that the `cached_eval` function in `src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py` uses the condition string as the sole key for caching the evaluation results. However, the evaluation also depends on the globals of the test item, which can differ between test modules. When pytest evaluates the condition string for the first test, it caches the result. When it encounters the same condition string in another test, it uses the cached result, which may be incorrect for the new test item's globals.

To resolve this, we can remove the caching mechanism and directly evaluate the condition every time `_istrue` is called. This ensures that each evaluation considers the current context's globals, providing accurate results.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Remove the `cached_eval` function**: 
   - Locate the `cached_eval` function in the `src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py` file and remove it.
  
2. **Modify `MarkEvaluator._istrue()` to directly evaluate conditions**:
   - Within the `MarkEvaluator` class in `src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`, modify the `_istrue` method to inline the condition evaluation, ensuring the correct globals are used for each test item.
 
**Detailed Descriptions:**

- **File:** `src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`
  - **Change:** Remove the `cached_eval` function:
    - Locate the `cached_eval` function defined towards the top of the file and remove it.
  - **Change:** Update the `_istrue` method in the `MarkEvaluator` class:
    - Directly evaluate the expression using Python's `eval` function, ensuring that the current globals are used for evaluation.
    - Inline the logic from the `cached_eval` function into the `_istrue` method, making sure that the expression is re-evaluated every time the method is called.

These changes should ensure that the condition string is correctly evaluated considering the current context's globals, preventing incorrect caching behavior and ensuring accurate test outcomes.

Note: Removing the cache removes a potential performance optimization, but given the correctness priority, this change is necessary. If performance becomes a concern, a more sophisticated caching mechanism that incorporates the relevant globals may be considered in the future.
