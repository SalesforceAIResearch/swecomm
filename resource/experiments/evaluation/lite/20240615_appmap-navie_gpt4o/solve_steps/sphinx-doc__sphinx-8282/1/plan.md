**Title**: Update `record_typehints` to Support autodoc_typehints Setting for Overloaded Callables

**Problem**:
The `autodoc_typehints` setting in Sphinx does not affect overloaded callables. Despite setting `autodoc_typehints` to 'none' in `conf.py`, type hints are still shown for overloaded functions in the generated documentation.

**Analysis**:
The root cause appears to be that the `record_typehints` function does not consider the different configurations set by `autodoc_typehints` when processing overloaded callables. Currently, it processes all type hints without checking this setting, leading to the unexpected inclusion of type hints for overloaded functions.

To fix this, we need to update the logic inside `record_typehints` to check the `autodoc_typehints` setting. If this setting is set to 'none' or another value that suppresses type hints, then the type hints should be excluded accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**:
Make changes to the `record_typehints` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` to respect the `autodoc_typehints` configuration.

1. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py**
   - In the `record_typehints` function, introduce a check for `app.config.autodoc_typehints`.
   - Modify the logic to handle overloaded callables based on the `autodoc_typehints` setting.
   - Ensure that type hints are not recorded when `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'none'.

Here are the details of what needs to be modified:

- **Function**: `record_typehints`
  - Add a condition to check the value of `app.config.autodoc_typehints` before recording type hints.
  - For each overload, ensure that type hints are excluded if `autodoc_typehints` is set to 'none'.

The changes will involve conditional checks and modifications to how type information is collected and processed.

**Files to be changed**:
- `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`

These changes will ensure that the behavior of the `autodoc_typehints` setting is consistent across both regular and overloaded callables, respecting the user's configuration in `conf.py`.
