**Title**: Modify `RenameModel` Operation to be a No-Op if `db_table` is Defined

**Problem**:
A `RenameModel` operation in Django that already has `db_table` defined should not perform any changes. However, in PostgreSQL, this operation currently drops and recreates foreign key constraints, and in SQLite, it recreates the table entirely, which can lead to unexpected behaviors and inefficiencies in the database schema.

**Analysis**:
The `RenameModel` operation is typically used to change the name of a model’s table within the database. However, if a custom table name (`db_table`) is already specified, this operation should become redundant and should not trigger any database changes. 
The primary source of the issue lies in how Django's database backend for PostgreSQL and SQLite handle the `RenameModel` operation:
- In PostgreSQL: Foreign key constraints are dropped and recreated.
- In SQLite: The entire table is recreated, which is the expected behavior for table renaming but unnecessary when `db_table` is defined.

To make `RenameModel` a no-op if `db_table` is defined, the operation logic within the database schema editor needs to be modified. The implementation of `RenameModel` should check if `db_table` is defined and, if so, skip the renaming operation.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `RenameModel` operation within the database schema editor to check if the `db_table` is defined.
2. If `db_table` is defined, log that the operation is a no-op and skip any database changes.
3. Ensure the logic does not affect any other operations or model definitions.

The specific Django Schema Editor classes and functions need to be modified as follows:

- **File**: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`
  - **Function**: `alter_db_table`
    - Add logic to check if the current and new table names are the same when the `db_table` is specified.
    - If they are the same, skip renaming.

- **File**: `django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py`
  - **Function**: `alter_db_table`
    - Similar to the SQLite schema editor, add logic to check if the `db_table` is defined.
    - If `db_table` is defined and the new table name matches, no-op the renaming operation.

- **File**: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`
  - **Function**: `state_forwards` and `database_forwards`
    - Ensure that the logic for adding operations also accounts for the no-op condition.

Here’s a detailed description of the necessary changes:

1. **File**: `django/db/backends/sqlite3/schema.py`
   - **Function**: `alter_db_table(self, model, old_db_table, new_db_table)`
     - Before executing renaming steps, add a condition to check if `old_db_table` and `new_db_table` are the same.
     - If they are the same, log an info message and return without making changes.

2. **File**: `django/db/backends/postgresql/schema.py`
   - **Function**: `alter_db_table(self, model, old_db_table, new_db_table)`
     - Implement the same conditional check as in the SQLite schema editor.
     - Ensure the logic properly handles PostgreSQL-specific nuances without affecting other operations.

3. **File**: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`
   - **Function**: `state_forwards(self, app_label, state)`
     - Add logic to ignore the `RenameModel` operation if `db_table` is defined and no difference is detected between the old and new table names.
   - **Function**: `database_forwards(self, app_label, schema_editor, from_state, to_state)`
     - Ensure the function respects the newly established no-op condition.

These changes will ensure that when a `RenameModel` operation is executed, it will check for the presence of `db_table` and skip any unnecessary operations to prevent unintended modifications to the database.
