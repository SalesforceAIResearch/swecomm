**Title**: Handle empty string for If-Modified-Since header gracefully

**Problem**: 
An empty string for the `If-Modified-Since` header used to be ignored, but now it raises an exception since commit `d6aff369ad3`.

**Analysis**:
The `If-Modified-Since` header is part of HTTP conditional requests. Its purpose is to allow the client to request a resource only if it has been modified since the time specified in this header. The relevant code should handle scenarios where this header can be empty, which may happen if a client sends an empty string by mistake or due to some issue. In the current code, an empty string in the `If-Modified-Since` header is causing an exception.

To fix this, we need to ensure that when an empty string is parsed as a date, it should be handled gracefully and not result in an exception.

**Proposed Changes**:
Focus on the relevant file handling the `If-Modified-Since` header:

- `django/views/static.py`:
  - Modify the `was_modified_since` function to check if the header is an empty string before attempting to parse it.
  - If the header is an empty string, handle it so that it equates to the resource being modified (i.e., should return `True`).

The affected lines are located in the `was_modified_since` function, within `django/views/static.py`.

1. Update the `was_modified_since` function:
    - Before parsing the `If-Modified-Since` header `header`, check if it is an empty string.
    - If it is, directly return `True`, which indicates the resource should be considered modified.

**Detailed changes**:
File: `django/views/static.py`

1. Locate the `was_modified_since` function.
2. In the `try` block of the function, add a condition to check if `header` is an empty string. If it is, bypass the rest of the code and return `True`.

By implementing these changes, you ensure that an empty string for `If-Modified-Since` header will be handled gracefully without raising an exception, restoring the previous behavior where an empty string was simply ignored.
