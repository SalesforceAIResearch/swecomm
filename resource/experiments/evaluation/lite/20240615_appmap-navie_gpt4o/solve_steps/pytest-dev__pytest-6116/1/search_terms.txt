pytest --collect-only needs a one char shortcut command
I find myself needing to run `--collect-only` very often and that cli argument is a very long to type one. 

I do think that it would be great to allocate a character for it, not sure which one yet. Please use up/down thumbs to vote if you would find it useful or not and eventually proposing which char should be used. 

Clearly this is a change very easy to implement but first I want to see if others would find it useful or not.
