### Add a One-Character Shortcut for `--collect-only` in pytest

**Problem**

The current `--collect-only` command line argument in pytest is lengthy and inconvenient for frequent use. Users would benefit from a single-character shortcut to streamline their workflow.

**Analysis**

To address this issue, we need to add a new short-form character alias for the `--collect-only` option in pytest. This involves modifying the argument parser to recognize the new short-form option and ensuring it functions identically to the long-form version.

The change is straightforward as it primarily involves updating the option parser configuration. Since no existing short-form option encodes `collect` functionality, the choice for a character can be arbitrary yet mnemonic, like `-c`.

**Proposed Changes**

* **Modify `pytest_addoption` function** in `src/_pytest/hookspec.py`: Update the argument parsing logic to include a new short-form character (e.g., `-c`) for the `--collect-only` option.

**Detailed changes:**

1. **Update `pytest_addoption` in `src/_pytest/hookspec.py`:**
   - This function registers argparse-style options and ini-style config values. Modify the `--collect-only` option to include a short-form character (e.g., `-c`).

You'll update the `pytest_addoption` function as follows:

text
from pluggy import HookspecMarker

hookspec = HookspecMarker("pytest")

@hookspec(historic=True)
def pytest_addoption(parser, pluginmanager):
    """register argparse-style options and ini-style config values,
    called once at the beginning of a test run.

    .. note::

        This function should be implemented only in plugins or ``conftest.py``
        files situated at the tests root directory due to how pytest
        :ref:`discovers plugins during startup <pluginorder>`.

    """
    parser.addoption(
        '-c', '--collect-only', action='store_true',
        help='only collect tests, don't execute them',
    )
```

That's it, the pytest command-line interface will now support `-c` as a shortcut for `--collect-only` without altering any downstream logic.

With these adjustments, users will have an easier time triggering the `collect-only` functionality with a simple `-c` shortcut.
