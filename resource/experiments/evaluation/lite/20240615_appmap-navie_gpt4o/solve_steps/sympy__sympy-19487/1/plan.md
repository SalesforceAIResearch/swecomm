**Title**: Add rewrite method for `sign` to convert to `Abs`

**Problem**: 
The `sign` function in SymPy, defined as `sign(z) := z / Abs(z)` for all non-zero complex numbers `z`, currently lacks an implementation to rewrite itself in terms of `Abs`. When attempting to rewrite `sign(x)` as `Abs`, the zero case must be handled appropriately to ensure consistency and correctness.

**Analysis**:
The implementation of the rewrite method for `sign` should convert an expression of the form `sign(x)` into `x / Abs(x)`. For non-zero `x`, this is straightforward. However, for `x=0`, directly performing `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan` (Not a Number), whereas the current implementation of `sign(0)` returns `0`.

We must decide between:
- Returning `nan` for `sign(0)` to be consistent with the mathematical definition `0 / Abs(0)`.
- Making the rewrite avoid the division by zero, keeping `sign(0)` as `0`.

Given that changing the value of `sign(0)` might break existing code relying on it, the safer approach is to make the rewrite avoid zero division.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Modify `sign` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`**:
    - Add a method `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` to the `sign` class.
    - Ensure the new method handles the zero case correctly, returning `0` instead of performing an undefined operation.

**Detailed Changes**:

- **File**: `sympy/functions/elementary/complexes.py`
    - Locate the `sign` class within the file.
    - Implement the `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method, considering the zero case appropriately.

    ### Pseudocode Outline:
    
    - Ensure any additional logic specific to SymPy's handling of expression rewriting is accounted for.

By implementing the `_eval_rewrite_as_Abs` method, users can correctly transform `sign(x)` into `x / Abs(x)` while maintaining the integrity of existing functionality for `sign(0)`.
