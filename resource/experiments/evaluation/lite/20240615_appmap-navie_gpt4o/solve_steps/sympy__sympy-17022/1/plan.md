**Title**: Correctly Handle Identity Matrix in `lambdify` Output

**Problem**: 
When using the `lambdify` function to evaluate an expression containing an identity matrix, the resulting function misinterprets the identity matrix as a complex number `1j` instead of a numeric identity matrix. This results in incorrect addition operations.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because of the way the printer handles the identity matrix `I`. In Python, `I` is also the notation for the imaginary unit `1j`. The current implementation returns `I` for identity matrices. When the `exec` function evaluates the generated function code, it references the `I` variable from the global namespace, which could be set to `1j` if using default NumPy namespaces. Thus, an identity matrix is mistakenly replaced by the imaginary unit, which leads to incorrect operations.

To fix this problem, modifications are required in the expression printer within the `lambdify` function to correctly substitute the identity matrix. The printer should return a NumPy identity matrix using `numpy.eye(...)` when it encounters the symbol `I`.

**Proposed Changes**:
The change should be implemented in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` within the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class. Specifically, the method responsible for printing expressions should be updated to handle identity matrices correctly.

1. **sympy/utilities/lambdify.py**:
    - Locate the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class and identify the function responsible for converting expressions to code strings.
    - Introduce a check within this method for identity matrices and substitute them with the appropriate NumPy function. This will involve ensuring that when the expression is printed as a string, identity matrices are replaced with `numpy.eye(...)`.

    Changes to be implemented:
    - Modify the `doprint` function to check if `expr` is an identity matrix.
    - If `expr` is an identity matrix, replace it with `numpy.eye(expr.shape[0])`.

2. **sympy/utilities/lambdify.py in the _EvaluatorPrinter class**:
    - Update the `doprint` method to handle the identity matrix case:
      - Check if `expr` is an instance of `Identity`.
      - Replace `I` with `numpy.eye(n)`, where `n` is the size of the identity matrix.
    
    For example, change:
    
    To:
    

By implementing these changes, any expression containing an identity matrix will be correctly translated into a code string that creates a NumPy identity matrix, avoiding any conflict with the imaginary unit `I`. This ensures that operations involving identity matrices yield accurate results during numerical evaluation.
