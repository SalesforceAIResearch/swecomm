**Title**: Fix `lambdify` to correctly interpret identity matrices in expressions

**Problem**: 
Using `lambdify` on expressions containing an identity matrix gives an unexpected result due to incorrect handling of the identity matrix (`Identity`) within the generated functions. The identity matrix is incorrectly interpreted as the imaginary unit (`1j`) instead of as a matrix. 

**Analysis**:
- The root cause lies in the way the `LambdaPrinter` or equivalent printer components handle the symbol `I`. It currently interprets `I` as the imaginary unit (`1j`).
- To correctly handle `Identity` matrices, the printer needs to:
  1. Recognize when an expression contains `Identity` matrices.
  2. Correctly convert these expressions to a form that can be interpreted as identity matrices within numerical libraries such as NumPy or SciPy.
- This requires updating the printer logic to differentiate between:
  - Usage of `I` as the imaginary unit,
  - Usage of `I` (or any symbol representing an identity matrix) as an identity matrix, and 
  - Potentially resulting in a custom representation or the use of specific functions for generating identity matrices.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **sympy/utilities/lambdify.py**:
   - Modify the `_EvaluatorPrinter` class or equivalent printing logic to detect `Identity` objects in expressions.
   - Add a condition in the printer that will convert `Identity(n)` into the appropriate NumPy/Scipy function call that generates an identity matrix, e.g., `numpy.eye(n)`.
   - Additionally, ensure that if an unsupported expression is encountered, the printer raises an appropriate error.

   Detailed steps:
   - Locate the `_EvaluatorPrinter.doprint` method.
   - Add logic to check if `expr` contains or is an `Identity` object.
   - If an `Identity` object is found, convert it to the equivalent NumPy/Scipy call (`numpy.eye(n)`).
   - Ensure existing handling of `I` as the imaginary unit (`1j`) is preserved and only replaced in the context of an identity matrix.

2. Ensure all functionalities dependent on the `lambdify` function consider this change and operate correctly.

This modification should resolve the misinterpretation issue and generate the expected numerical results when adding identity matrices to other matrices using `lambdify`.
