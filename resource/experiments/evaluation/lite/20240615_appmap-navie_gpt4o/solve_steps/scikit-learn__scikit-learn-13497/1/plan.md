**Title**: Fix discrete_features comparison in `_estimate_mi` to handle various data types correctly

**Problem**: In the `_estimate_mi` function, the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` is made to check if `discrete_features` is set to its default value. However, `discrete_features` can also be an array of indices or a boolean mask, which could cause issues in future versions of numpy when comparing a string to an array. Additionally, the function does not appear to be tested with `discrete_features` set to anything other than 'auto', which reduces test coverage.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue is that `_estimate_mi` directly compares `discrete_features` to the string 'auto'. If `discrete_features` is an array or a boolean mask, this comparison could fail or generate warnings/errors in future numpy versions. 

To resolve this, the function should first check the type of `discrete_features` before making the comparison. Specifically, if `discrete_features` is a string, only then should it be compared to 'auto'. If it is an array or boolean mask, the function should handle it appropriately without comparison.

Additionally, test cases need to ensure that the function is tested with `discrete_features` set to values other than 'auto', such as an array of indices and a boolean mask, to ensure the function's robustness.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`
    - **Location**: Modify the `_estimate_mi` function.
    - **Changes**:
        - Add a check for the type of `discrete_features` before comparing it to 'auto'.
        - Modify the comparison logic to handle arrays and boolean masks correctly.
        - Ensure that `discrete_features` is converted or validated appropriately based on its type.

2. **Suggested Modification**:
    - Modify the initial check for 'auto' to ensure it only compares when `discrete_features` is a string:
      

This will address the issue of comparing a string to an array and ensure compatibility with future versions of numpy.

Make these changes only to the `_estimate_mi` function and validate its new behavior with additional test cases in appropriate test files.
