Comparing string to array in _estimate_mi
In ``_estimate_mi`` there is ``discrete_features == 'auto'`` but discrete features can be an array of indices or a boolean mask.
This will error in future versions of numpy.
Also this means we never test this function with discrete features != 'auto', it seems?
