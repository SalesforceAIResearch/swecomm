**Title**: Fix `to_unstacked_dataset` for Single-Dimension Variables

**Problem**:
The function `to_unstacked_dataset` in the `xarray` library is failing for variables with a single dimension. Specifically, attempting to unstack these variables results in a `MergeError` due to conflicting values.

**Analysis**:
The problem appears when variables with only a single dimension are stacked and then an attempt is made to unstack them back to their original structure. The conflict arises from how coordinate values are handled during the unstacking process, leading to a `MergeError` due to incompatible coordinate schemes.

Here are the key issues:
1. **Coordinate Conflict**: During the unstacking, coordinates for single-dimension variables might not match as expected, causing a conflict.
2. **Single-Dimension Handling**: The logic to handle or recognize single-dimensional variables might be insufficient or missing.
3. **Compatibility Check**: The merging process checks for coordinate compatibility, which can trigger the merge error if conflicts are found.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modifications should be made to the `to_unstacked_dataset` function in `xarray/core/dataset.py` to properly handle single-dimension variables and avoid conflicts in coordinate values.

1. Locate the `to_unstacked_dataset` function inside `xarray/core/dataset.py`.
2. Add or modify the logic to detect single-dimension variables.
3. Enhance the unstacking logic to manage the coordinates of single-dimension variables correctly.
4. Adjust compatibility checks to ensure that they account for single-dimension scenarios and do not inadvertently raise a `MergeError`.

Specifically:
### xarray/core/dataset.py
1. **Modify the `to_unstacked_dataset` function**:
   - Add logic to handle single-dimension variables differently during the unstacking process.
   - Ensure that compatibility checks are adjusted to account for single-dimensional cases, preventing unnecessary conflicts.

Example steps:
1. **Detection**: Add a check to detect if the variables are single-dimensional.
2. **Coordinate Management**: Implement a special case or handling mechanism for managing coordinates of these single-dimensional variables during the unstacking.
3. **Merge Prevention**: Prevent conflicts by ensuring compatibility checks do not falsely identify coordinate conflicts for single-dimension variables.

By applying these modifications, the function should be able to handle round-trips of stacking and unstacking variables, including those with a single dimension, without errors.
