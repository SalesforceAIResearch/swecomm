**Title**: Fix `to_unstacked_dataset` for handling single-dimension variables

**Problem**

`to_unstacked_dataset` method is throwing a `MergeError` when attempting to unstack variables that only have a single dimension. 

**Analysis**

The error occurs because the current implementation does not handle single-dimension variables properly when trying to merge the unstacked arrays back into a dataset. The error: "conflicting values for variable 'y' on objects to be combined. You can skip this check by specifying compat='override'" indicates that the merge attempt is conflicting due to the way the variables are being handled post-unstacking.

The primary cause is that the stacking/unstacking process should handle single-dimension variables distinctively since their structure and merging logic differ from multi-dimensional ones.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **Location: xarray/core/variable.py - `to_unstacked_dataset` Method**:
    - Modify the merge logic to consider arrays with single dimension separately.
    - Ensure the unstacked arrays are not treated in the same manner as multi-dimensional arrays during the merge process.
    - Enhance the compatibility checks to handle single-dimension variables without conflict.

2. **Modification Details**:
    - Within the `to_unstacked_dataset` method, introduce a condition to check if the variable is single-dimensional.
    - Implement logic to handle the merging of single-dimensional arrays uniquely to prevent `MergeError`.
    - Adjust the default `compat` and coordination name handling for such cases.

By making these changes, the `to_unstacked_dataset` method would be able to handle single-dimension variables correctly and roundtrip stack/unstack operations without causing a `MergeError`.

These modifications will ensure a smooth unstacking process for single-dimensional variables, thus fixing the issue.

Given that amendments are targeted within a single method, the minimal and localized changes promise that the feature set will be robust and existing functionality remains unharmed.
