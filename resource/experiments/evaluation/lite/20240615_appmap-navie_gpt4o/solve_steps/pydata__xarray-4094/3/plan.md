**Title**: Fix `to_unstacked_dataset` functionality for single-dimension variables

**Problem**: The `to_unstacked_dataset` method fails when applied on a stacked array derived from variables that only have a single dimension, resulting in a `MergeError` due to conflicting values for the variable being unstacked.

**Analysis**: The issue stems from the way the `to_unstacked_dataset` method handles single-dimension variables during the unstacking operation. Specifically, when only one dimension exists, this method must ensure that the unstacked variables can be properly merged back into their original state. The current implementation appears to introduce conflicts when trying to merge these single-dimension variables back into the dataset.

To resolve this, we need to adjust the logic that specifies how individual variables are merged during the unstacking process, ensuring compatibility checks are correctly handled. The root cause of the `MergeError` is that the method does not currently distinguish between the original structure of single-dimension variables and those with multiple dimensions, leading to conflicting values when variables are combined.

**Proposed Changes**: Modify the `to_unstacked_dataset` method in the `xarray/core/dataset.py` or `xarray/core/variable.py` file to provide special handling for single-dimension variables during the unstacking process. Here are the steps to achieve this:

1. **Identify Conflict Origin**: Locate the section in `to_unstacked_dataset` where single-dimension variables are handled.
2. **Adjust Merging Logic**: Ensure that the method checks if the variables being merged are single-dimension and apply logic that allows for conflict-free merging.
3. **Compat Parameter**: Introduce or correctly utilize the `compat='override'` parameter to bypass unnecessary conflicts in values during the merge operation.

**Detailed Steps to Modify `xarray/core/dataset.py`**:

1. **Locate the `to_unstacked_dataset` Method**: Open the `xarray/core/dataset.py` file and locate the `to_unstacked_dataset` method.
2. **Review Merge Operation**: Identify where the merge operation is causing issues with single-dimension variables.
3. **Conditional Logic for Single-Dimension**: Add conditional checks that identify if a variable is single-dimension:
   - If true, handle the merging differently to ensure there are no conflicting values.
   - Apply the `compat='override'` setting if conflicts are detected to ensure variables can be merged without error.
4. **Testing**: After implementing changes, run a set of tests to verify the fix and ensure the method now handles single-dimension variables correctly without raising a `MergeError`.

By implementing these changes, the `to_unstacked_dataset` method should be able to handle single-dimension variables effectively, allowing for a flawless roundtrip of stacking and unstacking operations without encountering merge conflicts.
