**Title**: Allow Flexible Parameter Types in NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis to Prevent GridSearch Failures

**Problem**:
NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis (NCA) performs strict type-checking on parameters, which causes failures during GridSearchCV. Parameters like `tol` and `n_components` may not be exactly as expected when created by param_grid, leading to type errors.

**Analysis**:
The issue is caused by the strict type-checking of parameters in NCA. Specifically, the `tol` parameter expects a float, whereas param_grid may supply an int in certain cases. Similarly, `n_components` expects an int, but param_grid might provide an np.int64, causing an inconsistency in expected types. Strict type-checking restricts flexibility and usability in scenarios like GridSearchCV.

A more robust solution is to relax the type-checking so that different but compatible data types (like np.int64 for int) are accepted. This can be achieved by modifying the parameter validation mechanism to be more permissive, ensuring that equivalent numeric types are acceptable.

**Proposed Changes**:
We need to update the `_validate_params` method in `sklearn/neighbors/nca.py` to accommodate more flexible parameter types without compromising the validity of the input. Here are the changes required:

1. **Update Parameter Type Checks**:
   Ensure that parameters `tol` and `n_components` accept compatible numeric types.

2. **Modify `_validate_params` Method**:
   Change type-checking from strict type matches to allowing numeric data types through polymorphic checks.

3. **Changes in `sklearn/neighbors/nca.py`**:
   - In the `_validate_params` method, adjust checks for `tol` and `n_components` to allow compatible numeric types.
   - Ensure that if `tol` is provided as an integer, it is converted to a float.
   - For `n_components`, check if the provided value is a valid integer, regardless of its specific subtype.

### Detailed Description of Changes:

- **sklearn/neighbors/nca.py**:

 1. **Update the `_validate_params` Method**:
    - Modify the checks for `tol`:
      - Ensure `tol` is a numeric type and convert to float if necessary.
      - E.g., `if not isinstance(self.tol, (int, float)) or self.tol <= 0:`
      - Use `self.tol = float(self.tol)` to ensure it is a float.
      
    - Modify the checks for `n_components`:
      - Ensure `n_components` is an integer or an integer subtype.
      - E.g., `if not isinstance(self.n_components, (int, np.integer)) or self.n_components <= 0:`

By implementing these changes, the NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis will accept a wider range of numeric types for its parameters, preventing type errors during GridSearchCV and improving overall robustness.

Steps to modify `sklearn/neighbors/nca.py`:

1. Locate the `_validate_params` method.
2. Modify the type-checking conditions for `tol` and `n_components` to be more inclusive of related numeric types.
3. Convert `tol` to float if provided as an integer.
4. Ensure `n_components` accepts any valid integer type (including subtypes).

This way, NCA becomes more flexible with parameter types, especially solving the issue when used with GridSearch and similar scenarios.
