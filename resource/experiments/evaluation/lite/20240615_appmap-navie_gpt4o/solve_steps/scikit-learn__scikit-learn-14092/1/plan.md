**Title**: Modify Parameter Validations in NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis to Allow Flexible Types

**Problem**:
The current parameter checking in `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` (NCA) is too strict, which causes it to fail during GridSearch. Specifically, the type checks for parameters such as `tol` and `n_components` are rigid, leading to issues when these parameters are passed as different numerical types (like `np.int64` rather than `int`) in GridSearch.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue lies in the strict type checks in NCA's `_validate_params` method. For example:
- The `tol` parameter expects a `float`, rejecting parameters of type `int` even though numerically equivalent.
- The `n_components` parameter expects an `int`, rejecting parameters of type `np.int64`.

A more flexible validation approach should be adopted to handle different numerical types that are equivalent. This can be achieved by relaxing the type checks, converting inputs to the required types when necessary, and validating their values.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `_validate_params` method in `sklearn/neighbors/nca.py` to incorporate flexible type checks.
2. Convert parameters to their expected types inside `_validate_params` and ensure the values are within acceptable ranges.
3. Utilize a more generalized parameter validation tool to simplify and standardize parameter checks across different parts of the codebase.

**Detailed File Changes**:
- **File**: `sklearn/neighbors/nca.py`

  - **Location**: `_validate_params` method (found in the code-selection at line 311-327)
    - **Changes**:
      - Implement a flexible type conversion for `tol` and `n_components`.
      - Check if `tol` can be converted to a `float` and if its value is within an acceptable range.
      - Check if `n_components` can be converted to an `int` and if its value is positive.
      - Add similar flexibility for other parameters as needed.

**Example of Changes**:
- Modify `_validate_params` to handle flexible types for `tol`, `n_components`, and other parameters:
  

By implementing these changes, the `NeighborhoodComponentsAnalysis` will validate parameters more flexibly, making it compatible with GridSearch and other tools that may pass different numerical types.
