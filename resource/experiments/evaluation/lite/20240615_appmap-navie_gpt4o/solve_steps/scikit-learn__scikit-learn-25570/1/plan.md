**Title**: Handle transformers with no features in ColumnTransformer with pandas output

**Problem**: 
When using the `ColumnTransformer` from `scikit-learn` with "pandas" as output, transformers that are applied to 0 features (e.g., an empty list of categorical features) cause the transformation to fail. This happens because such transformers are not fitted, thus do not appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` function and subsequently cause an issue when the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function expects their names but receives none, resulting in a length mismatch error.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the issue resides in how the `_hstack` method handles the results of transformations when converting to a pandas DataFrame. If a transformer applies to no features, it is excluded from the fitting process, leading to an inconsistency in expected outputs by `self._add_prefix_for_feature_names_out`. To solve this, any transformers that apply to 0 features should be explicitly managed by recognizing and skipping them during fitting and transforming processes, ensuring they do not interfere with the output stages.

**Proposed Changes**:
To resolve this issue, changes are to be made in the `_hstack` method and related procedures in the `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py`:

1. **Modify `_hstack` Method**:
   - Update the method to explicitly check and skip transformers that apply to no features during the conversion to pandas DataFrame in the `_hstack` method.

2. **Update `fit_transform` Process**:
   - Ensure that transformers with no features are appropriately skipped during the fitting process to avoid inconsistencies in the output.

Here are the detailed changes to be made in `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py`:

1. **In `_hstack` function**:
    - Location: Around line 862
    - Update logic to check for empty feature transformers before handling output.

2. **In `_iter` function**:
    - Location: Around line 515
    - Add or modify logic to skip transformers with no features.

**Detailed Changes**:

* Update `_hstack` function to skip empty feature transformers:
  

* Ensure `_iter` function does not include empty feature transformers:
  

While making these changes, inspect each related function within `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py` to ensure complete coverage of instances where the transformers are fetched and iterated through without handling empty feature transformers.

By implementing these changes, the `ColumnTransformer` will gracefully handle cases where certain transformers do not apply to any features, thereby fixing the length mismatch error and maintaining the integrity of the pipeline with "pandas" as a specified output format.
