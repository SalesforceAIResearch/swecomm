**Title**: Adjust `_hstack` method in ColumnTransformer to handle steps with 0 features

**Problem**:
When using the `ColumnTransformer` with transformers that apply to 0 features and setting the output to "pandas", the process breaks due to a mismatch in feature names and transformer outputs.

**Analysis**:
The issue occurs in the `_hstack` method within `ColumnTransformer` when attempting to concatenate the outputs from transformers. If a transformer is applied to 0 features, no fitting occurs, and it doesnâ€™t appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)`. As a result, the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function encounters issues with input consistency, leading to a Length mismatch error. Specifically, the steps that don't transform any features are not taken into account properly, causing discrepancies in the expected and actual length of feature name arrays.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify `_hstack` in `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py` to check for transformers with 0 features and handle them appropriately.

   - **Logic to correct**:
     - Adjust `_hstack` to include a conditional check for transformers with 0 features.
   - **Proposed Change**:
     - Before concatenating the output arrays, identify and exclude or handle transformers that apply to zero features. This may require filtering out such transformers or providing a compatible default behavior before calling `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out`.

A detailed description of changes to `_hstack`:

- Implement a check within `_hstack` that examines the length of each transformer's output.
- If a transformer has zero features, it should be appropriately skipped or handled to ensure that name assignments remain consistent.


**By ensuring steps with 0 features are properly excluded or skipped**, we prevent the `Length mismatch: Expected axis has X elements, new values have 0 elements` error, aligning the final output dimensions with the actual transformed features.

This approach maintains functionality compatibility while addressing the specific case where some transformers apply to zero features.
