Fix ColumnTransformer to Handle Transformers with No Features When Output is Set to Pandas

### Problem 

When using the `ColumnTransformer` with transform set to "pandas" and one or more transformers with no features, the following issue arises: the transformers with no features are not fitted and don't appear in the `self._iter(fitted=True)` list. This results in a broken input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function, which subsequently causes a `ValueError` due to a length mismatch while setting column names.

### Analysis

1. The root cause of the issue is transformers with no features being skipped during the fitting process when the output is set to "pandas".
2. `ColumnTransformer` needs to appropriately handle scenarios where a transformer has no applicable features.
3. During the iteration over transformers in the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function, there is an assumption that all intended transformers have been fitted. This assumption breaks when transformers with no features are skipped.
4. The design should be adapted to ensure transformers with zero features are either properly ignored in the `_hstack` process or included in a manner that their absence does not result in an index mismatch.

### Proposed Changes

Modify the `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py` file to address this issue. The changes will be made to the `_hstack` method and possibly elsewhere in `ColumnTransformer` to ensure such transformers are correctly ignored or handled.

1. Modify the `_hstack` method to exclude transformers with zero features from the concatenation process:
    - Adjust the list comprehension or loop to ensure transformers with zero features do not affect the formation of the final output DataFrame or NumPy array.
    
2. Update the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function to handle cases where certain transformers might have added zero features:
    - Skip empty transformers in both feature addition and name-prefixing steps to ensure the final column names match the resulting DataFrame structure.

### Detailed Code Changes

**File: `sklearn/compose/_column_transformer.py`**

1. **Modification in `_hstack` method:**
   - Update the list comprehension handling `Xs` to filter out empty lists associated with transformers that had zero input features:
     
   - Similarly, when configuring for "pandas" output:
     

2. **Update in `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function:**
   - Filter the transformer names and feature names to include only those with non-zero features:
     
   - This ensures that the length of `names_out` matches `Xs_non_empty`, preventing a length mismatch error.

3. **Extra Safeguards:**
   - Optionally place debug or validation checks to raise warnings if transformers with zero features are detected:
     

This selective exclusion and careful handling ensure that transformers with zero features do not disrupt the overall process while maintaining the integrity of the `pandas` DataFrame output.

With these changes, the `ColumnTransformer` should properly handle scenarios involving zero-feature transformers when the output is set to `pandas`.
