**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

ColumnTransformer with pandas output can't handle transformers with no features
### Describe the bug

Hi,

ColumnTransformer doesn't deal well with transformers that apply to 0 features (categorical_features in the example below) when using "pandas" as output. It seems steps with 0 features are not fitted, hence don't appear in `self._iter(fitted=True)` (_column_transformer.py l.856) and hence break the input to the `_add_prefix_for_feature_names_out` function (l.859).


### Steps/Code to Reproduce

Here is some code to reproduce the error. If you remove .set_output(transform="pandas") on the line before last, all works fine. If you remove the ("categorical", ...) step, it works fine too.

import pandas as pd
