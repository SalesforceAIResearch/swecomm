**Title**: Update `align_labels` Method to Allow Figure Pickling

**Problem**: The `align_labels` method in Matplotlib causes an issue when attempting to pickle a figure. An error is raised: `TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object`.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue lies in the usage of weak references within the `align_labels` method or the objects it interacts with. Python's `pickle` module cannot serialize weak references, leading to the observed error. To fix the bug, ensure that the methods and their associated objects do not rely on constructs that cannot be pickled, such as weak references.

The `align_labels` method in Matplotlib could be creating or utilizing weak references which, directly or indirectly, get associated with the figure, thus causing the `pickle` operation to fail.

To resolve this, we need to modify the appropriate method in the Matplotlib library to avoid using weak references in a way that persists in the figure object when `align_labels` is called.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` (assuming the `align_labels` method is implemented or referenced here)

2. **Change Description**:
    - Locate the `align_labels`, `align_xlabels`, and `align_ylabels` methods within `figure.py`.
    - Review and identify any use of weak references within these methods.
    - Refactor the usage of weak references such that they do not create persistent weak references within the figure object structure.

Modify functions to eliminate weak references that get attached to the primary figure object. If the weak references are necessary internally, ensure they are detached or cleaned up immediately after use, ensuring the figure object remains pickle-friendly.

Here are some specific strategies:
  - Replace weak references with strong references where feasible.
  - Use a temporary context for weak references that cleans up after the method execution.
  - Ensure any temporary objects using weak references do not attach themselves to the figure object or its components.

**Changes Overview**:
   - Check for the presence of `weakref` in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`.
   - Identify and replace weak references with equivalent strong references or temporary constructs wherever necessary.

This will ensure that calling `align_labels` on a figure will no longer hinder the figure's ability to be pickled. The figure's labels will be correctly aligned, and the figure will remain serializable.
