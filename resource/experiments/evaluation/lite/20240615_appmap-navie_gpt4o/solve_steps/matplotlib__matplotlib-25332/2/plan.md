**Title**: Fix pickling error caused by `align_labels()` in figure alignment

**Problem**: The `align_labels()` method is causing a pickling error: `TypeError: cannot pickle 'weakref.ReferenceType' object`.

**Analysis**: The `align_labels()` function somehow incorporates a weak reference (weakref) that is not serializable by Python's pickle module. This weak reference possibly stems from the relationship established when aligning labels, which is common in graphical libraries that mimic complex object interactions to maintain interdependencies without creating strong reference cycles.

**Proposed Changes**: The issue is likely isolated to the `align_labels()` function in the context of label alignment logic. Therefore, I recommend modifying the source file where the `align_labels()` method is implemented to remove or appropriately handle the weak reference.

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` (Source file containing the figure alignment logic)
   
   - **Function**: Locate the `align_labels()` method.
   
   - **Changes**: Replace weak references with strong references or use picklable constructs like tuples or lists to store or handle any cyclic dependencies without breaking the necessary functionality. Ensure that any cross-references or callbacks used in `align_labels()` are stored in a manner that does not incorporate weak reference types.
   
   - Additionally, perform a deep scan to identify any subordinate methods or utility functions that `align_labels()` may call, potentially introducing weak references.

Be cautious not to break the interactivity or label alignment provided by this function, but rather reformulate how references are held or maintained during the alignment process.

This targeted change should resolve the pickling error while maintaining the utility of the `align_labels()` method.
