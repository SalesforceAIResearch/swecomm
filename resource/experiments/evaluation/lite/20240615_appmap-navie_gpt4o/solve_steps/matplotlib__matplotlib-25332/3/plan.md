**Title**: Fix pickling of figure with aligned labels in `align_labels()` function.

**Problem**: When trying to pickle a Matplotlib figure that has used the `align_labels()` method, it throws a `TypeError` stating that a 'weakref.ReferenceType' object cannot be pickled. This issue occurs because the `align_labels()` method introduces a weak reference in the figure, which is not picklable.

**Analysis**: 
The `align_labels()` function in Matplotlib is designed to align the x or y labels of subplots within a figure. However, when this method is called, it appears to leave behind weak references which can't be serialized by the `pickle` module. Weak references are advantageous for certain use cases in Matplotlib, but their presence in serialized data can cause issues.

**Proposed Changes**: 
To resolve this issue, the `align_labels()` function in Matplotlib should be modified to ensure that any weak references are appropriately handled or removed during pickling. Specifically, the focus will be to modify the `_align_labels` utility function which `align_labels()` depends on. 

The changes should be made in the following file:

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`
    - **Function**: `_align_labels`
    - **Changes**:
        - Ensure that any added weak references are excluded during the pickling process.
        - Introduce a `__getstate__` method in the `_AlignPickleHelper` class (if it exists) to clear weak references before pickling, and a `__setstate__` method to restore the initial state after unpickling.

Detailed steps:
1. Locate the `_align_labels` function inside `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`.
2. Add `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods to the `_AlignPickleHelper` class to handle pickling of objects correctly.
3. In the `__getstate__` method, remove weak references before state is pickled.
4. In the `__setstate__` method, restore any state, including re-assignment of weak references if needed.

By making these changes, the `align_labels()` method should no longer introduce obstacles to pickling a figure.
