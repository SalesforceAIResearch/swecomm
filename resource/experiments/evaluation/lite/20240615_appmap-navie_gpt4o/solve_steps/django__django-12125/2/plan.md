**Title**: Fix incorrect path for inner classes in makemigrations

**Problem**:
When you define a subclass from `django.db.models.Field` as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a `django.db.models.Model` class, `manage.py makemigrations` generates a migrations file that incorrectly refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class. This incorrect reference leads to import errors when applying the migration.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue lies in how Django's migration framework deconstructs and reconstructs field definitions. Specifically, when deconstructing a field to store it in a migration file, the class path is being derived in a manner that overlooks inner class nesting. Consequently, it generates a path that appears to refer to a top-level class rather than considering the actual nested structure.

To properly address this, we need to ensure that the deconstruction logic correctly captures and reconstructs the full path considering inner class scope. This typically involves modifying the logic responsible for field deconstruction within the migrations framework.

**Proposed Changes**:
The following changes should be made in the relevant file(s) to correct this issue:
1. Update the deconstruction logic in `field_references_model` and similar utility functions to correctly handle nested classes.
2. Amend the path resolution mechanism in migration operation classes to accurately reflect the nested class structure.

**Location** and **Specific Changes**:

1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`
   **Changes**:
   - Update the `deconstruct` method to correctly handle nested classes.
   - Ensure that when converting the field class to a string, the nested scope is preserved.

2. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`
   **Changes**:
   - Modify utility functions that resolve field paths to handle inner class scope.
   - Ensure that any function that converts a field to its string representation includes checks for nested class structures and includes the full path.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **In `fields.py`**:
   - Locate the `deconstruct` method within the `Field` class or related classes.
   - Update the logic that converts the class to its string representation to account for nesting.

2. **In `__init__.py`**:
   - Locate functions that refer to field class resolution and adjust their logic to recognize nested class structures.
   - Extend these functions to traverse up the class hierarchy, ensuring inner classes are correctly represented.

By ensuring that nested classes are accurately represented in the migration's field references, paths should correctly reflect their true structure, thus addressing the import errors raised by `manage.py makemigrations`.
