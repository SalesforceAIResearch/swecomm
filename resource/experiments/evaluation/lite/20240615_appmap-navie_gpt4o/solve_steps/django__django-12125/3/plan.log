**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

makemigrations produces incorrect path for inner classes
Description
	
When you define a subclass from django.db.models.Field as an inner class of some other class, and use this field inside a django.db.models.Model class, then when you run manage.py makemigrations, a migrations file is created which refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it is in.
To reproduce, create the following as your model:
class Outer(object):
	class Inner(models.CharField):
		pass
class A(models.Model):
	field = Outer.Inner(max_length=20)
After running manage.py makemigrations, the generated migrations file contains the following:
migrations.CreateModel(
	name='A',
	fields=[
		('id', models.AutoField(auto_created=True, primary_key=True, serialize=False, verbos... (1631)
