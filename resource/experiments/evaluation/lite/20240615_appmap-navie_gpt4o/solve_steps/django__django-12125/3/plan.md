### Title
Fix inner class path resolution in `makemigrations`

### Problem
`manage.py makemigrations` generates incorrect paths for inner classes. Specifically, when a subclass of `django.db.models.Field` is defined as an inner class of another class and used in a `django.db.models.Model`, the generated migrations file incorrectly refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class in the module. This leads to incorrect class path references in the migrations file, making it impossible to apply the migration correctly.

### Analysis
This issue arises because the migrations framework does not properly handle inner classes when it serializes field descriptors in the migration files. When `makemigrations` serializes the field, it fails to account for the nesting of the class inside another class. Instead of generating a reference to `Outer.Inner`, it generates a reference to `Inner`.

To fix this, we need to update the `deconstruct` method used during the serialization of the model fields. This method should be aware of nested classes and generate the correct module and class path reference for them.

A potential point of interest in the Django codebase is the `deconstruct` method defined in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. This method needs to be adjusted to correctly traverse and reconstruct the full class path of inner classes.

### Proposed Changes
Modify the `deconstruct` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` to correctly handle inner classes.

1. **Locate and update the `deconstruct` method**:
    - The method needs to be enhanced to check if the class is nested within another class.
    - It should then generate the appropriate path by traversing the parent classes until it reaches the top-level module.

#### Modifications:
- **django/db/models/fields/__init__.py**:
  - Update the `deconstruct` method to detect and handle inner classes correctly by:
    - Retrieving the parent class (if any).
    - Constructing the full path of the inner class by appending parent class names.

By making these adjustments, the `deconstruct` method will correctly serialize the path for inner classes, ensuring that `makemigrations` generates the correct class path in the migration files.

This change will ensure the generated migration files reference the inner classes correctly, such as `test1.models.Outer.Inner` instead of `test1.models.Inner`.

### Required Changes Summary
1. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`
   - Modify the `deconstruct` method to correctly resolve and serialize paths for inner classes.
