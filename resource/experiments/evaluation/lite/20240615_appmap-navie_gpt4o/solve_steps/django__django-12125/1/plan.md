**Title**: Fix `makemigrations` to handle inner classes correctly

**Problem**:
When defining a subclass from `django.db.models.Field` as an inner class, and then using this field inside a `django.db.models.Model` class, `manage.py makemigrations` generates an incorrect path for the inner class. The generated migrations file wrongly refers to the inner class as if it were a top-level class of the module it resides in, leading to incorrect paths such as `test1.models.Inner` instead of `test1.models.Outer.Inner`.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the migration creation logic does not correctly account for the nesting of classes inside other classes. It treats inner classes as if they were top-level entities within the module. The incorrect path is generated due to the failure to properly fetch and serialize the full reference of the inner class.

To resolve this, the Django code responsible for constructing the migration operations should be updated to correctly identify and serialize fully qualified names of inner classes.

**Proposed Changes**:
The required fix will involve updating the `deconstruct` methods and possibly other serialization-related logic in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file to correctly account for inner class references.

1. **django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py**

    - Update the logic that deconstructs the model fields to correctly compute the full import path when the field is an inner class.

    In the `deconstruct` method within your relevant Field class:
    - Add logic to detect if the field class is an inner class.
    - Accumulate the parent class names up to the top-level class to construct the correct path.

    For example:
        1. Check whether the class has an `__module__` and `__qualname__` attribute.
        2. Use these attributes to construct the full module path, including the levels of nesting.

By updating the way paths are constructed and serialized, the system will properly account for nested classes and generate the correct migration files.
