**Title**: Fix the 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' error in `Gcf` class

**Problem**: 
When running 3D plotting code with Matplotlib, the error 'AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'' may appear under certain conditions, typically after changing `numpy` array inputs for line plotting. This error persists until the IPython kernel is restarted.

**Analysis**: 
This issue likely originates from the internal state handling of `Line3D` objects in Matplotlib, especially when switching between different input types (such as numpy arrays and integers). This internal state does not get reset properly, causing an AttributeError when the `_verts3d` attribute is accessed.

The `Gcf` (Global Current Figure Manager) class in `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` might not be properly cleaning up objects and their associations when figures are destroyed or recreated. Ensuring that all attributes, especially `_verts3d`, are cleaned up or reset when figures are destroyed should solve this problem.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py**:
   - Modify the `destroy` method in the `Gcf` class to explicitly reset or remove the `_verts3d` attributes of `Line3D` objects when they are destroyed.

Detailed changes are as follows:

- **lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py**

  - **Modify `destroy` method**:
    - In the destruction process, add a check for `Line3D` objects and ensure that their `_verts3d` attribute is properly reset or deleted.

Explanation of changes:
1. Inside the `destroy` method of the `Gcf` class, traverse through all figures' `Line3D` objects.
2. Check if the `Line3D` object has the attribute `_verts3d`.
3. Reset or delete the `_verts3d` attribute to ensure clean-up.

These changes should help in preventing the aforementioned AttributeError by ensuring that `Line3D` objects are properly reset or removed when figures are destroyed.

**Example of conceptual changes**:
Modify the destroy method to reset `_verts3d` attributes:



This approach will ensure that the internal state of `Line3D` objects is properly managed, thereby preventing the cited AttributeError and its associated issues.
