**Title**: Fix the 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d' error in `Gcf` class

**Problem**: 
When running 3D plotting code with Matplotlib, the error 'AttributeError: 'Line3D' object has no attribute '_verts3d'' may appear under certain conditions, typically after changing `numpy` array inputs for line plotting. This error persists until the IPython kernel is restarted.

**Analysis**: 
This issue likely originates from the internal state handling of `Line3D` objects in Matplotlib, especially when switching between different input types (such as numpy arrays and integers). This internal state does not get reset properly, causing an AttributeError when the `_verts3d` attribute is accessed.

The `Gcf` (Global Current Figure Manager) class in `lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py` might not be properly cleaning up objects and their associations when figures are destroyed or recreated. Ensuring that all attributes, especially `_verts3d`, are cleaned up or reset when figures are destroyed should solve this problem.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py**:
   - Modify the `destroy` method in the `Gcf` class to explicitly reset or remove the `_verts3d` attributes of `Line3D` objects when they are destroyed.

Detailed changes are as follows:

- **lib/matplotlib/_pylab_helpers.py**

  - **Modify `destroy` method**:
    - In the destruction process, add a check for `Line3D` objects and ensure that their `_verts3d` attribute is properly reset or deleted.

Explanation of changes:
1. Inside the `destroy` method of the `Gcf` class, traverse through all figures' `Line3D` objects.
2. Check if the `Line3D` object has the attribute `_verts3d`.
3. Reset or delete the `_verts3d` attribute to ensure clean-up.

These changes should help in preventing the aforementioned AttributeError by ensuring that `Line3D` objects are properly reset or removed when figures are destroyed.

**Example of conceptual changes**:
Modify the destroy method to reset `_verts3d` attributes:



This approach will ensure that the internal state of `Line3D` objects is properly managed, thereby preventing the cited AttributeError and its associated issues.

    Singleton to maintain the relation between figures and their managers, and
    keep track of and "active" figure and manager.

    The canvas of a figure created through pyplot is associated with a figure
    manager, which handles the interaction between the figure and the backend.
    pyplot keeps track of figure managers using an identifier, the "figure
    number" or "manager number" (which can actually be any hashable value);
    this number is available as the :attr:`number` attribute of the manager.

    This class is never instantiated; it consists of an `OrderedDict` mapping
    figure/manager numbers to managers, and a set of class methods that
    manipulate this `OrderedDict`.
