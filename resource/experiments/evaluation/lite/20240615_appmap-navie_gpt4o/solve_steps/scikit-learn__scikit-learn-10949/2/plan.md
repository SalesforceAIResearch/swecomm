### Title:
Fix `warn_on_dtype` to trigger warning with Pandas DataFrame inputs in `check_array`

### Problem:
The `warn_on_dtype` parameter in the `check_array` function is intended to raise a `DataConversionWarning` when the data type of the input data structure does not match the requested dtype and a memory copy is needed. However, this warning is not triggered when the input is a Pandas DataFrame.

### Analysis:
The `check_array` function processes various types of input data, including lists, NumPy arrays, and sparse matrices. When handling these inputs, it appropriately triggers the `DataConversionWarning` if `warn_on_dtype` is set to True and the data type is converted. However, this functionality does not seem to extend to Pandas DataFrames.

The issue arises because the `check_array` function uses `np.asarray` to convert input data to a NumPy array, which does not inherently track the dtype conversion in a way that can trigger the warning for Pandas DataFrames.

### Proposed Changes:
To fix this issue, we need to modify the `check_array` function to explicitly check for dtype conversion when the input is a Pandas DataFrame. Here’s a detailed plan for the changes needed in the `sklearn/utils/validation.py` file:

1. **Import Pandas**:
   Ensure that Pandas is imported at the top of the file.

2. **Modify `check_array` Function**:

   - After converting the input to a NumPy array, check if the original input was a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Check if `warn_on_dtype` is set to True.
   - Compare the original dtype of the DataFrame with the dtype of the converted NumPy array.
   - If the dtype has changed, trigger a `DataConversionWarning`.

### Detailed Description of Changes:
1. **File: `sklearn/utils/validation.py`**:
   - **Import Pandas**: Add `import pandas as pd` at the top of the file.
   
   - **Modification in `check_array` Function**:
     - Add a condition to check if the input is an instance of `pd.DataFrame` and if `warn_on_dtype` is True.
     - Compare the original dtype (`array_orig.dtypes`) with the converted dtype and trigger the warning if they don’t match.



### Summary:
These changes modify the `check_array` function to extend the `warn_on_dtype` functionality to Pandas DataFrame inputs. This will ensure that the appropriate `DataConversionWarning` is raised when the DataFrame’s dtype is converted, thereby aligning with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.
