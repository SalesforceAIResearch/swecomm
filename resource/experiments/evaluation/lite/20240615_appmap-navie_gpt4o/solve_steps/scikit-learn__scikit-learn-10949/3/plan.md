**Title**: Fix `warn_on_dtype` to trigger `DataConversionWarning` with `DataFrame` input in `check_array`

**Problem**: 
The `check_array` function from `sklearn.utils.validation` does not raise the `DataConversionWarning` when the input is a pandas `DataFrame` and the `warn_on_dtype` parameter is set to `True`. This inconsistency leads to no warning messages being thrown despite implicit data type conversions happening.

**Analysis**:
1. The function `check_array` is responsible for validating input arrays, lists, and sparse matrices, and optionally converting them to the specified type.
2. The `warn_on_dtype` parameter is intended to warn the user if the input data type does not match the required data type and a conversion is performed.
3. The provided example illustrates that when passing a `DataFrame` with a dtype of `object` to `check_array`, no warning is raised even though a conversion to `float64` dtype occurs. 
4. The absence of warning likely stems from the fact that the conversion happens on numpy arrays extracted from `DataFrame` via `np.asarray`, ensuring dtype compliance. The logic to check and raise `DataConversionWarning` might not be handling `DataFrame` specifically.

**Proposed Changes**:
To address this issue, modify `check_array` in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` to capture the data type conversion for pandas `DataFrame` and raise a warning appropriately.

1. Inside `check_array`, after converting the input to a numpy array (which includes handling `DataFrame` through `np.asarray`), check if the input type was a `DataFrame`:
  - Add a check for `pandas.DataFrame` to determine the original data type.
  
2. Modify the dtype warning logic in `check_array` to cover the conversion of `DataFrame`:
  - Add an explicit comparison between the original dtype (before conversion) and the new dtype (after conversion) specifically for `DataFrame` to ensure `DataConversionWarning` is triggered.

**Detailed description of the necessary changes** (File: `sklearn/utils/validation.py`):
- Locate the `check_array` function.
- Within the dtype warning section, include an additional check for `DataFrame`:
  - Import pandas and add conditionals to check if the input is a `DataFrame`.
  - Compare the original `dtype` of the `DataFrame` and the resulting numpy array `dtype`.
  - Raise `DataConversionWarning` if a conversion has occurred and `warn_on_dtype` is `True`.

By introducing these changes, the function will then correctly handle `DataFrame` inputs, providing users with the expected `DataConversionWarning` when there is an implicit type conversion.
