Let's enhance the `Options` class in `django/db/models/options.py` to ensure that child models respect the `Meta.ordering` attribute of their parent models.

In particular, we will make modifications in the following functions:

1. `_prepare(self, model)`
2. `_get_fields(self, ...)`
3. `get_ordering(self, base_ordering=...)`

Here is how the changes would be applied:

### Change 1: Enhance `_prepare()` method to inherit `Meta.ordering` from parent models

### Change 3: Modify `get_ordering` function to respect parent ordering

        for parent in self.parents:
            if parent._meta.ordering:

</change>

These changes ensure that if a child model does not explicitly define an ordering, it will inherit the ordering defined in its parent model's `Meta.ordering` attribute.
