**Title**: Ensure inherited models respect parent model's Meta.ordering

**Problem**: 
When querying a child model that inherits from another model, the query ordering specified in the parent's model's `Meta.ordering` is not respected. Specifically, an ordering using `"-pk"` in the parent's model results in an ascending order `("pk" ASC)` instead of the expected descending order `("-pk" DESC)`.

**Analysis**: 
This issue arises because the ordering logic does not properly propagate the `Meta.ordering` attribute from the parent model to the child model. As a result, the child model's queries do not inherit the expected ordering configuration when they are created. This can be fixed by ensuring that the `Meta.ordering` attribute is properly considered during query creation for inherited models.

**Proposed Changes**: 
To ensure that the child model respects the `Meta.ordering` attribute of the parent model, modifications should be focused on enhancing the way `Meta.ordering` is inherited and applied to the child model's queries. The most relevant file to modify for addressing this issue is `django/db/models/options.py`.

- **File**: django/db/models/options.py
  - **Function**: `_prepare(model)`
    - **Change**: Modify the logic in the `_prepare()` method to ensure that `Meta.ordering` from the parent model is properly propagated and applied to the child model when the ordering attribute is defined.

  - **Function**: `_get_fields()`
    - **Change**: Adjust this internal helper function to review if during fields retrieval, the ordering-related meta-fields from the parent models are considered and properly merged into the child models.

  - **Function**: `get_ordering()`
    - **Change**: Validate and ensure that the `Meta.ordering` from parent models are checked when fetching the ordering configuration so that they can be inherited and applied correctly by sub-classes.

By implementing these changes, the ordering of inherited models will properly respect the `Meta.ordering` attribute of the parent models, thus addressing the problem described.

These changes should predominantly enhance the inheritance behavior of the `Meta.ordering` attribute, ensuring consistency in queries generated and executed for child models.
