**Title: Implement __eq__ method for ValidationError class to support equality comparison**

**Problem:**
Currently, `ValidationError` instances with identical messages do not compare as equal. This behavior can complicate certain types of testing where the equality of errors needs to be checked. A more intuitive equality check is required, which ensures that `ValidationError` instances with the same messages, regardless of the order, are considered equal.

**Analysis:**
The `ValidationError` class is found in the `django/core/exceptions.py` file. The main task is to introduce an `__eq__` method that checks for the equality of `ValidationError` instances. This method should look beyond simple message comparison and consider error lists and dictionaries, ensuring that the order of messages does not affect the equality check.

Steps for the logic change:
1. Implement the `__eq__` method in the `ValidationError` class to compare messages.
2. This method should handle cases where the `ValidationError` instances contain dictionaries or lists of errors.
3. Ensure that the comparison is order-independent. This may require sorting the errors or converting them into a canonical (standardized) form before performing the comparison.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. Modify the `django/core/exceptions.py` file:
   - Add an `__eq__` method in the `ValidationError` class.
   - This method should first check if the other object is an instance of `ValidationError`.
   - When comparing, handle different structures (`self.error_list` and `self.error_dict`) and ensure the comparison remains order-independent.
   - Compare the canonical forms of the error lists/dictionaries to achieve order-independent equality.

Detailed change:
- In the `ValidationError` class, add the following method:
  - `__eq__(self, other)` method to handle equality comparison.
  - Ensure that the method checks the type of `other`.
  - Compare `self.error_dict` and `other.error_dict` by converting them into a sorted list of tuples, capturing the error messages and their associated fields.
  - Similarly, compare `self.error_list` and `other.error_list` as sets (because sets inherently do not consider order).

By implementing these changes, `ValidationError` instances with identical messages, regardless of the order, will be considered equal, thus simplifying error comparison during testing and ensuring the behavior is intuitive.

By following the above logic, the issue will be resolved with minimal changes and without affecting the existing functionality.
