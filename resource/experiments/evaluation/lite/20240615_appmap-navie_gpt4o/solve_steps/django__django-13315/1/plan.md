**Title**: Prevent duplicate options in formfield with limit_choices_to involving a join on a ForeignKey

**Problem**: When a `Q` object is used with `limit_choices_to` on a `ForeignKey` field, involving a join, it can result in duplicate options being rendered in the form field. This causes user confusion and inconsistency in the form data representation.

**Analysis**:
- The root cause of the issue lies in the way the query is constructed when using `limit_choices_to` with a `Q` object involving a join. When `limit_choices_to` is applied, it results in SQL queries that may return duplicate records if joins are involved.
- To handle this, ensuring that the query result is distinct would prevent duplicate options from appearing in the form field.
- The logic needs to be modified to ensure that the queryset generated from the `limit_choices_to` parameter is distinct before being used in the form field.

**Proposed Changes**:
- **File**: `django/contrib/admin/filters.py`
  - **Method**: `field_choices` in the `RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter` class
  - Modify the `pk_qs` queryset to ensure it is distinct. Add the `distinct()` method to the queryset to filter out duplicate records.
  - Alter the logic to account for ensuring distinct results before passing it to the form field.

Here are the detailed steps:

1. **File**: `django/contrib/admin/filters.py`
   - **Modification**: Ensure that the `pk_qs` queryset is distinct.
   
   python
   pk_qs = model_admin.get_queryset(request).values_list('%s__pk' % self.field_path, flat=True)
   python
   pk_qs = model_admin.get_queryset(request).distinct().values_list('%s__pk' % self.field_path, flat=True)
   
   
By making the above changes, we ensure that any duplicates arising from joins in the `Q` object used in `limit_choices_to` are eliminated, resulting in distinct options in the formfield.
