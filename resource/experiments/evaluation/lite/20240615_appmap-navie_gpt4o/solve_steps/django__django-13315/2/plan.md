**Title**: Fix Duplicate Options in ForeignKey FormField with limit_choices_to

**Problem**:
When using the `limit_choices_to` option on a `ForeignKey` field with a joined query (via a Q object), duplicate options may appear in the form field, causing inconsistency and confusion for users.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue arises from the `field_choices` method in the `RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter` class. Specifically, the query constructed in this method lacks distinct selection, leading to duplicate primary key values in the queryset. These duplicates then propagate to the choices rendered in the form field.

To resolve this, the queryset should ensure unique primary key values before generating the choices. This can be achieved by modifying the query to include distinct selection and adjusting the logic to accommodate the join conditions specified by the Q object in `limit_choices_to`.

**Proposed Changes**:
File: `django/contrib/admin/filters.py`

1. **Modification in field_choices method**: The `field_choices` method currently calls `model_admin.get_queryset(request).distinct().values_list()`. To ensure unique entries based on the primary key, the use of `distinct` needs to be aligned with the specific requirements of the join conditioned by the Q object in `limit_choices_to`.

2. **Update the RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter class**:
   - Modify the `field_choices` method to apply distinct selection accurately, ensuring no duplicate primary keys are included.
   - Ensure that the ordering logic remains effective after applying distinct selection.

Detailed changes in `django/contrib/admin/filters.py`:

- Locate the `RelatedOnlyFieldListFilter` class.
- In the `field_choices` method, modify the queryset to use `distinct()` correctly in conjunction with the joins specified in `limit_choices_to`.

Here is the proposed detailed description:
   
**django/contrib/admin/filters.py**:
   - Modify the line where `pk_qs` is defined to ensure the query is distinct based on the primary key values. Adjust the join logic as needed to ensure no duplicates are introduced.



This change ensures that duplicates are filtered out before forming the form field choices, thereby rectifying the flaw described.
