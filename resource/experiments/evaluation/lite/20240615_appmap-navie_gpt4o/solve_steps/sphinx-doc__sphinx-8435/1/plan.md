**Title**: Apply `autodoc_type_aliases` to Variables and Attributes in Sphinx

**Problem**:
When using the Sphinx `autodoc` extension with `autodoc_type_aliases` configured, the aliases do not apply to type annotations of module-level variables and class attributes.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the `autodoc` extension currently does not recognize type aliases specified in `autodoc_type_aliases` for variables and attributes. The `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration is intended to map type names to more descriptive aliases (e.g., `'String'` to `'example.MyString'`), but it appears this configuration only affects function and method signatures, not module-level or class-level variables/attributes.

To resolve this, the `autodoc` extension should be improved to apply the type aliases to all type annotations, including those for variables and attributes. 

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/type_comment.py`

    Modify the function that processes type annotations to also look at module-level variables and class attributes. You need to ensure that the `autodoc_type_aliases` are checked and applied in these contexts.

    - **Function**: Extend or insert logic within `update_annotations_using_type_comments` or pertinent helper functions that handle type processing.
    - **Logic**:
        - When processing the type annotations, if a type matches an alias specified in `autodoc_type_aliases`, replace it with the specified alias.
        - Ensure that variables and class attributes are included in this processing.

2. **Modification Logic**:
    - In the function that parses and stores type annotations, iterate through variables and attributes.
    - For each type annotation found, check if it exists in `autodoc_type_aliases`.
    - If a match is found, replace the type with the alias value.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
    - **Locate**: Identify functions or methods within `type_comment.py` where type annotations are processed.
    - **Enhance**: Augment these functions to include additional logic for handling variables and attributes.
    - **Modify/Extend**: 
        - For handling global/module-level variables, ensure their type annotations are inspected and aliases are applied.
        - For class-level attributes, within the class parsing logic, inspect attribute annotations and apply aliases when needed.

4. **Detailed Change Description**:
    - Find all instances within the code where type annotations are processed.
    - Add logic to check `autodoc_type_aliases` during the type string generation.
    - Update the docstring and comments to reflect the support for type aliases in variables and attributes.

This modification ensures that all type annotations within your project respect the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration, providing a consistent and accurate autogenerated documentation.

By applying these changes to the appropriate functions, you ensure that `example.var` and `example.MyString.var` (from the provided example) correctly reflect the specified type aliases in the generated documentation.
