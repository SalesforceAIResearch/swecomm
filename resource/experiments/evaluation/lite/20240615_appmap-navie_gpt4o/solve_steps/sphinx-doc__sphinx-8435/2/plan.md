**Title**: Update `autodoc` to Apply `autodoc_type_aliases` to Variables and Attributes

**Problem**:
The `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration in Sphinx is not applied to type annotations for variables and attributes within the documentation generated by `sphinx.ext.autodoc`. This prevents the expected type alias replacements from appearing in the documentation for annotated variables and attributes.

**Analysis**:
The `autodoc_type_aliases` setting is designed to replace type annotations with user-defined type aliases to improve readability in the generated documentation. However, this functionality appears to be limited to function signatures and not extended to class variables or module-level variables. The current implementation of `autodoc` needs to be enhanced to apply the type aliases to all type annotations, including those for class and module-level variables.

1. **Identification and Parsing**: The parsing function that handles type annotations for functions and methods (potentially located in `sphinx.ext.autodoc.type_comment`) needs to be extended or duplicated to parse type annotations for attributes.
2. **Integration with `autodoc_type_aliases`**: The logic that handles the `autodoc_type_aliases` mapping needs to be applied not only to function signatures but also to attributes at both the class and module levels.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/type_comment.py`
    - Update the `update_annotations_using_type_comments` function to also consider attributes when applying `autodoc_type_aliases`.

    Suggested changes:
    - Modify `get_type_comment` and `update_annotations_using_type_comments` functions to fetch and apply type comments for variables and attributes.
    - Ensure that the logic inside `update_annotations_using_type_comments` also iterates over attributes of classes and modules along with method parameters.

2. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`
    - Update the main `autodoc` extension module to incorporate the processing of `autodoc_type_aliases` for all documented attributes and variables.

    Suggested changes:
    - Add logic to detect attributes and module-level variables, and apply the type alias replacements accordingly using the `autodoc_type_aliases` configuration.

The exact lines to be added or modified cannot be pinpointed without examining the exact logic flow in the existing functions. However, the essence of the proposed changes centers around ensuring that all type annotations (including those for attributes) are processed through the `autodoc_type_aliases` mapping. This may require auxiliary functions to parse and apply type annotations universally across different code components.

By implementing these changes, the functionality of `autodoc_type_aliases` will be extended to variables and attributes, thereby providing the expected behavior in the generated documentation.
