**Title**: Fix incorrect simplification of `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` in `trigsimp`

**Problem**: The `trigsimp` function incorrectly simplifies the expression `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` to `cos(x) + sin(x)` for a general complex `x`. The correct behavior should account for the branch cut of the square root function and properly distinguish between positive and negative roots.

**Analysis**: The issue stems from the oversimplification performed by the `trigsimp` function when handling expressions involving square roots of trigonometric functions. For general complex `x`, the simplification should not assume that `sqrt(sin(x)**2) = sin(x)`. This mistake likely occurs due to pattern matching in `_trigsimp` function or other helper functions which do not take into account the complex domain intricacies.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Update `_trigsimp` function** in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` to handle square roots of trigonometric functions more accurately.
   - Refactor the pattern matching logic to ensure that square roots are correctly simplified depending on the sign and the branch cut of the square root function.
   
2. **Add checks** in the **`_trigsimp`** for recognizing and handling the expression `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` explicitly.
   - Modify the conditional checks to differentiate between real and complex domains where appropriate.
   
3. Ensure that the simplification logic accounts for both the positive and negative roots of the square root function.

4. **Refactor `_eval_trigsimp`** method within `trigsimp` to utilize the updated `_trigsimp` function effectively.

### Detailed Proposed Changes in `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`:

1. **Update `_trigsimp`**:
   - Locate the section where the transformation rules for trigonometric identities are applied.
   - Introduce a specific rule for handling `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` that carefully evaluates the sign depending on the context (e.g., involve the `sign` function).
   - Ensure that for real `x`, the expression is simplified correctly to `|sin(x)|` instead of assuming any specific branch.

2. **Amend `_match_div_rewrite`** and other helper functions:
   - Ensure these functions correctly propagate the new logic introduced.
   - Introduce new cases or modify existing ones to handle the square root cases differently based on domain checks.

3. **Example Modification in `_trigsimp`** (Detailed description):
   - Check the expression for specific square root patterns.
   - Before simplification, apply checks to ensure that any radical is simplified according to its domain.
   - For instance, use `Abs`, `sign`, or other utilities to handle both positive and negative roots correctly and do not oversimplify.

By addressing the issue at these points, we ensure that the simplification respects complex analysis principles and does not lead to incorrect results in symbolic computations.
