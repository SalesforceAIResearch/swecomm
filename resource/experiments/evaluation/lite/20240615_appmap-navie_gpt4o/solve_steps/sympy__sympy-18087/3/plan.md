**Title**: Fix incorrect trig simplification for complex expressions in trigsimp

**Problem**: The `trigsimp` function incorrectly simplifies the expression `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` as `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex `x`. This behavior is inconsistent because the function correctly handles the expression when `x` is real.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem is that `trigsimp` does not properly account for the complex nature of the input when simplifying trigonometric expressions. Specifically, `trigsimp` should handle the expression `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` differently for complex inputs since `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is not necessarily equal to `sin(x)` in the complex domain. The simplification should maintain the absolute value of the result to ensure correctness for complex numbers.

To fix this, we need to modify the `trigsimp` function to correctly handle the absolute value when simplifying expressions involving `sqrt`. This can be done by adding a check and appropriate handling in the relevant part of the `trigsimp` logic. 

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`
   - Modify the `trigsimp` function to handle complex trigonometric simplifications by accurately processing `sqrt(sin(x)**2)`.

2. **Modifications**:
   - Identify the section of code where simplifications involving `sqrt` are handled.
   - Add a check to determine if the expression involves a complex input.
   - If the input is complex, use the absolute value function to ensure the correct simplification.

   Detailed Description:
   
   - Locate the part of the code within `trigsimp` where it performs transformations on trigonometric expressions, particularly those involving `sqrt`.
   - Adjust the logic to:
     - Detect if `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` appears in the expression.
     - Rather than directly simplifying this as `sin(x)`, simplify it as `Abs(sin(x))` for complex inputs.
     - Maintain backward compatibility by ensuring this change does not affect real inputs where the current behavior is correct.

By making these changes, the `trigsimp` function will correctly simplify `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` to `cos(x) + Abs(sin(x))` for complex `x`, thus preserving mathematical correctness.

This should address the issue found while writing teaching material and prevent similar incorrect simplifications in the future.
