**Title: Correct `trigsimp` to Handle sqrt(sin(x)**2) Correctly for General Complex x**

**Problem:**
The `trigsimp` function in SymPy incorrectly simplifies the expression `cos(x) + sqrt(sin(x)**2)` to `cos(x) + sin(x)` for general complex x. This is mathematically incorrect because `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` should be `Abs(sin(x))` to account for the general complex nature of x, especially when x is not restricted to real values.

**Analysis:**
The error arises because the current implementation of `trigsimp` does not handle the square root of a squared trigonometric function properly for complex arguments. Specifically, it assumes `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` is equal to `sin(x)`, which holds true only for real x where sin(x) is non-negative. For complex numbers, the square root of a square should be represented with an absolute value to encompass all possible values of x.

The expected correct simplification behavior should be:
- For real x: `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` should simplify to `|sin(x)|` which is just `sin(x)` for positive values and `-sin(x)` for negative values.
- For complex x: `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` should be `Abs(sin(x))`.

**Proposed Changes:**
We need to modify the logic within the `trigsimp` function, specifically where it simplifies square roots of squares of trigonometric functions.

1. **Modify the `__trigsimp` helper function**:
   - Ensure that when encountering expressions like `sqrt(sin(x)**2)`, it replaces them with `Abs(sin(x))` instead of `sin(x)`.

2. **Update pattern matchers and simplification rules**:
   - In the `_match_div_rewrite` function and other places where the simplifications happen, update the rules to correctly handle square roots of squared trigonometric functions.

Here are the detailed changes:

1. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py**

- **In `__trigsimp` function**:
  - Locate the section where multiplication and simplifications are handled.
  - Add logic to identify and replace `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` with `Abs(sin(x))`.

- **In `_match_div_rewrite` function**:
  - Update relevant cases to ensure that expressions like `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` get correctly simplified to `Abs(sin(x))`.

**Relevant changes in the file:**

- Modify the `_trigpat` function to identify patterns like `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` and replace them with `Abs(sin(x))`.

Here's a step-by-step modification plan:

1. **Update _trigpats:**
   - Add pattern recognition for `sqrt(trig(x)**2)` and replace it with `Abs(trig(x))`.

2. **Function/__trigsimp:**
   - Add a case to handle the simplification of `sqrt(trig(x)**2)` to `Abs(trig(x))` during the recursive simplifications.

**Implementation Steps:**

1. **Update `_trigpats` function:**
   - Add a pattern to recognize `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` and map it to `Abs(sin(x))`.

2. **Update `__trigsimp` function:**
   - Recognize expressions matching `sqrt(trig(x)**2)` and replace it with `Abs(trig(x))`.

3. **Modify `_match_div_rewrite` for correct substitutions:**
   - Ensure the simplification correctly considers the magnitude for complex numbers.

In summary, these changes will ensure that `trigsimp` works correctly for both real and complex values of x, accurately simplifying `sqrt(sin(x)**2)` to `Abs(sin(x))`. This fix will address the fundamental issue exposed when teaching with SymPy.
