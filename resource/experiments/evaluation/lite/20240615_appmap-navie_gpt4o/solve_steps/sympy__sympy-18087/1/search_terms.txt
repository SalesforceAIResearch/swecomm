Simplify of simple trig expression fails
trigsimp in various versions, including 1.5, incorrectly simplifies cos(x)+sqrt(sin(x)**2) as though it were cos(x)+sin(x) for general complex x. (Oddly it gets this right if x is real.)

Embarrassingly I found this by accident while writing sympy-based teaching material...
