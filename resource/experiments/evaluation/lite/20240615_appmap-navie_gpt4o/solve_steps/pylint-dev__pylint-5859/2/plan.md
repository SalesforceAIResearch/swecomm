**Title:** Fix `--notes` Option to Include Note Tags Entirely Punctuation

**Problem:**
When using the `--notes` option in pylint, note tags consisting entirely of punctuation (e.g., "???") are ignored, resulting in no fixme warnings (W0511) being reported for such lines. The expected behavior is that all specified note tags, including those that are entirely punctuation, should be reported if found in the code.

**Analysis:**
Pylint uses the `--notes` option to identify lines in the code that contain specific note tags and report them as fixme warnings if found. The issue arises because the current implementation filters out note tags that are entirely punctuation, which causes pylint to not report these tags.

The root cause appears to be in the part of the code where note tags are being processed and filtered. The system likely overlooks note tags that are composed only of punctuation characters.

To resolve this issue, we need to adjust the logic that processes the `--notes` option to include punctuation-only note tags.

**Proposed Changes:**
The file `pylint/checkers/tags.py` should be modified to ensure that note tags consisting entirely of punctuation are not filtered out.

1. **Locate the Code Responsible for Filtering Note Tags:**
   - Inside `pylint/checkers/tags.py`, find the logic where note tags are being processed and filtered.

2. **Adjust the Filtering Logic:**
   - Modify the logic to include punctuation-only note tags in the warning check.

### Changes in `pylint/checkers/tags.py`

- Identify the function that handles the note tags specified via the `--notes` option.
- Adjust the part of the code where note tags are being filtered to ensure punctuation-only tags are also considered valid and not excluded.

The modification should be made so that when the `--notes` option is provided with punctuation-only tags, the fixme warnings are appropriately generated.

By making these changes, `pylint` will correctly recognize and report tags that are entirely punctuation, ensuring that they are included in the fixme warnings just like any other tags composed of alphanumeric characters.
