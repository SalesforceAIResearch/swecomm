**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

"--notes" option ignores note tags that are entirely punctuation
### Bug description

If a note tag specified with the `--notes` option is entirely punctuation, pylint won't report a fixme warning (W0511).

```python
# YES: yes
# ???: no
```

`pylint test.py --notes="YES,???"` will return a fixme warning (W0511) for the first line, but not the second.

### Configuration

```ini
Default
```


### Command used

```shell
pylint test.py --notes="YES,???"
```


### Pylint output

```shell
************* Module test
test.py:1:1: W0511: YES: yes (fixme)
```


### Expected behavior

```
************* Module test
test.py:1:1: W0511: YES: yes (fixme)
test.py:2:1: W0511: ???: no (fixme)
```

### Pylint version

```shell
pylint 2.12.2
