**Title**: Fix `--notes` Option to Recognize Tags Composed Entirely of Punctuation

**Problem**: 
The `--notes` option in pylint is currently ignoring note tags that are composed entirely of punctuation. For example, when the `--notes` option is set to "YES,???", pylint recognizes the "YES" tag but ignores the "???" tag, resulting in no fixme warning (W0511) being reported for comments starting with "???". This behavior leads to inconsistent and incomplete report generation.

**Analysis**:
The issue likely arises from a logic check in the code that filters or parses note tags. Note tags consisting entirely of punctuation might be getting filtered out or ignored due to inappropriate handling of special characters. To ensure that all specified note tags, regardless of their composition, are recognized, the parsing and checking logic for these tags needs to be reviewed and adjusted.

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the note tag parsing and checking logic in the relevant file to properly handle note tags composed entirely of punctuation.

1. **File: pylint/reporters/json_reporter.py**
   - **Function:** Modify the function responsible for parsing the `--notes` option to correctly handle tags composed entirely of punctuation.
   - **Logic Changes:** Update the logic to ensure that punctuation-only tags are not filtered out or ignored. This might involve adjusting regular expressions or logic conditions that handle tags in the parsing process.

2. **File: pylint/utils.py (if applicable)**
   - **Function:** If the tag parsing logic is centralized in a utility function, modify this function to ensure it includes punctuation-only tags.
   - **Logic Changes:** Adjust the regular expressions or parsing conditions to correctly identify and include tags composed entirely of punctuation.

By making these changes, pylint will properly recognize and report comments associated with note tags composed entirely of punctuation, ensuring consistent fixme warnings.

### Detailed Changes in `pylint/reporters/json_reporter.py`:

1. **Function to Modify: Ensure that the initial parsing of the `--notes` option includes a robust check for all characters.**
   - Update the parsed notes list to correctly handle punctuation-only tags.
   - Adjust any filters that exclude tags based on character composition.

2. **Update Specific Logic: If there is a regular expression or condition that might exclude punctuation-only tags, revise it to ensure inclusive parsing.**

Implement the changes as follows:
- Identify the section where note tags are parsed from the command-line arguments.
- Ensure tags composed of any characters, including punctuation, are added to the list of recognized tags.
  
**Note:**
The exact lines and functions to be modified depend on the lokasi (location) and structure of the existing parsing logic. Upon reviewing the exact module structure and the command-line parsing implementation, these specific points can be addressed.

By following this plan, the `--notes` option will correctly include all specified tags, ensuring more precise and comprehensive linting results.
