**Title**: Fix "--notes" option to properly handle note tags consisting entirely of punctuation

**Problem**: The `--notes` option currently fails to report fixme warnings (W0511) for note tags that are composed entirely of punctuation characters. When such tags are specified in the `--notes` option, pylint does not recognize and report them properly.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue is related to how the `--notes` option processes and matches note tags. It appears that the matching mechanism incorrectly filters out tags that are purely punctuation. This can be addressed by modifying the logic that processes the note tags and ensuring that it doesn't exclude punctuation-only tags.

**Proposed Changes**: The changes should be made to the file where note tags are processed and filtered, most likely in the linter or a related utility function that handles the `--notes` option. 

1. Locate the function or method that processes the note tags specified via the `--notes` option.
2. Modify this function to ensure that note tags consisting entirely of punctuation are not filtered out or otherwise ignored.
3. Ensure that the modified processing logic still recognizes and handles other types of note tags correctly.

**Files to be Modified**:
- Modify the relevant function in the `pylint/lint/pylinter.py` or a directly related utility module where the `--notes` option is parsed and processed.

By addressing the filtering logic and ensuring that it correctly includes punctuation-only note tags, this issue can be resolved, and pylint will then properly report fixme warnings for such tags.
