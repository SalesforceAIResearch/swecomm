**Title**: Modify `Point.__add__` to handle multiplication of `Point` and scalar correctly

**Problem**: 
The addition of a `Point` and a scalar multiplication of another `Point` behaves inconsistently depending on the order of operations. Specifically, `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` works fine, but `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` raises a `GeometryError`.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this problem lies in the `__add__` method of the `Point` class. The error occurs due to how the `__add__` method tries to normalize the dimensions when the left-hand operand is a scalar multiplication of a `Point`. In this case, the method attempts to cast the left-hand operand (`2.0 * point2`) to a `Point`, resulting in a `TypeError` since `Point` expects a sequence of coordinates instead. Consequently, a `GeometryError` is raised.

To resolve this, the `__add__` method needs to be modified to check if the `other` operand is an instance of a scalar multiplication with a `Point`. If so, the scalar should be distributed over the `Point` coordinates before proceeding with the addition.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: sympy/geometry/point.py**
   - **Function: `Point.__add__`**:
     - Modify the `__add__` method to handle cases where the `other` operand is a multiplication of a `Point` and a scalar.
     - Add a check to see if `other` is an instance of `Mul` and contains a `Point`. If so, distribute the scalar over the `Point` coordinates before performing the addition.

Detailed changes:
- Update the `Point.__add__` method to account for `other` being a scalar multiplied by a `Point`.
- Use the `Mul` class to check the operand type and distribute the scalar appropriately.

In the `Point.__add__` method:
1. Check if `other` is an instance of `Mul` and contains a `Point`.
2. If yes, distribute the scalar multiplication over the `Point` coordinates.
3. Proceed with the existing logic to normalize dimensions and add the points.



These changes will ensure that `point1 + sympy.sympify(2.0) * point2` and `point1 + point2 * sympy.sympify(2.0)` yield the same result, thus resolving the inconsistency in behavior.
