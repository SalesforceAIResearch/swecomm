**Title: Correct Handling of Multipliching Points With Scalars**

**Problem:**
Multiplying a sympy.geometry.Point instance with a scalar from the right side (e.g., `scalar * Point`) results in an unexpected error, while the left multiplication works correctly. This inconsistency causes a `TypeError` followed by a `GeometryError`.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue lies in the `Point.__add__` method and potentially the lack of proper handling in `Point.__rmul__` or `Point.__mul__` method for right-side multiplications. When multiplying a Point by a scalar from the right, the result is expected to be a `Mul` instance which cannot be directly converted into a Point by merely passing it to the Point constructor.

Here’s the detailed analysis:
1. **Point.__add__ Method**: This method expects other objects to be either a Point or convertibles that can normalize the dimension. When it encounters a right-multiplication scenario (like `scalar * Point`), it tries to convert the result of this multiplication (`Mul` instance) into a Point, which causes the failure.
2. **Point.__rmul__ Method**: Although this method is supposed to handle reverse multiplication for Points, it seems to be missing or not correctly implemented to cover the scalar multiplication scenario.

**Proposed Changes:**
To resolve this, we need to:
1. Implement the `Point.__rmul__` method to handle multiplication by scalars properly.
2. Ensure that both `Point.__mul__` and `Point.__rmul__` methods handle scalar multiplications and return a new Point with appropriately scaled coordinates.

Here's a detailed description of the necessary changes:

1. **Point Class (__mul__ Method) Update (sympy/geometry/point.py)**:
    - Add a check for scalar multiplication and handle the multiplication of the point’s coordinates by the given scalar.

2. **Add __rmul__ Method to Point Class (sympy/geometry/point.py)**:
    - Implement the reverse multiplication method to handle cases where a scalar precedes the Point instance in a multiplication operation.

Here is what needs to be modified:

**File**: sympy/geometry/point.py

**Description of Changes:**

1. **Update `__mul__` Method in `Point` Class**:
    - Modify the `__mul__` method to correctly handle scalar multiplication. Ensure that when a scalar is multiplied by the Point, it returns a new Point instance with scaled coordinates.

2. **Implement `__rmul__` Method in `Point` Class**:
    - Add a new `__rmul__` method to the `Point` class to ensure scalar multiplication works when the scalar is on the left side.


By making these changes, we ensure consistent behavior of scalar multiplication with Point instances regardless of the position of the scalar.

**Example of Changes to Be Made:**

**sympy/geometry/point.py**

1. **Update the `__mul__` Method**:
    - Ensure that `Point.__mul__` correctly manages scalar * Point and Point * scalar scenarios.

2. **Add the `__rmul__` Method**:
    - Implement `Point.__rmul__` to correctly handle reverse scalar multiplication.

By applying these changes, the following code:

will successfully execute without raising an exception and will produce the expected result.
