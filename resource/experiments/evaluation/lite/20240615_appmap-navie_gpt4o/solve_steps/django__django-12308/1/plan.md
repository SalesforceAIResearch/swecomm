**Title**: Fix JSONField Display in Admin When Readonly to Show Proper JSON Format

**Problem**: 
JSONField values are displayed as Python dictionaries when they are readonly in the Django admin interface. For example, `{"foo": "bar"}` is displayed as `{'foo': 'bar'}`, which is not valid JSON format.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the `display_for_field` method in `django.contrib.admin.utils` directly converts field values to strings without properly formatting them as JSON when the field is a `JSONField`. Specifically, it doesn't use the `prepare_value` method of `JSONField` which correctly handles JSON formatting and the `InvalidJSONInput` cases.

**Proposed Changes**:
Make modifications to the `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` file to properly format JSONField values when they are displayed in the admin interface. The logic should include a special case for `JSONField` that calls the field's `prepare_value` method.

1. **File**: `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`
   - **Function**: `display_for_field`
     - Add a special case to handle `JSONField` by calling its `prepare_value` method for proper JSON formatting.
     - Modify the existing if-condition checks to incorporate this special case.

   Here's an outline of the changes:
   - Import the `JSONField` from `django.db.models`.
   - Update the `display_for_field` function to check if the field instance is a `JSONField`.
   - Use the `prepare_value` method of the `JSONField` to format the value appropriately.

By incorporating these changes, the `JSONField` values will be correctly displayed as valid JSON strings even when the field is readonly in the admin interface.
