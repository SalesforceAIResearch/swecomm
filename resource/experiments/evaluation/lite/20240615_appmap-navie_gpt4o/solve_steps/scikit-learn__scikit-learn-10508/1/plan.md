**Title:** Fix LabelEncoder transform to handle empty lists for all data types

**Problem:**
The `LabelEncoder` class in scikit-learn does not handle transforming empty lists consistently across different data types. When the encoder is fitted with strings and then used to transform an empty list, it raises a TypeError due to a data type conversion issue. The expected behavior is that transforming an empty list should return an empty array, regardless of the data type used during fitting.

**Analysis:**
The issue arises because the `transform` method of the `LabelEncoder` class does not explicitly check if the input list is empty before attempting to transform it. Consequently, when numpy's `searchsorted` function is called, it tries a data type conversion that fails for certain inputs (like strings). To fix the issue, we need to add an early check in the `transform` method to immediately return an empty array if the input list is empty.

**Proposed Changes:**
File: `sklearn/preprocessing/label.py`

1. Modify the `transform` method of the `LabelEncoder` class to handle empty input lists explicitly.
   
2. Check if the input list `y` is empty, and if so, directly return an empty array of the appropriate data type.

Here are the detailed steps for the modification:

1. **Check if input `y` is empty:**
   - Inside the `transform` method, right after converting `y` to an array using `column_or_1d(y, warn=True)`, add a condition to check if the array is empty (`len(y) == 0`).

2. **Return empty array:**
   - If the array is empty, return `np.array([], dtype=self.classes_.dtype)` to ensure the data type of the output matches the data type of the fitted classes.

These changes should ensure that the `transform` method returns an empty array when given an empty list as input, regardless of the data types involved during fitting.

**Detailed Changes:**

1. Locate the `transform` method in the `LabelEncoder` class.

2. Add the following code segment to handle empty input lists:

In `sklearn/preprocessing/label.py`:



By implementing this fix, the `LabelEncoder`'s `transform` method will return an empty array when passed an empty list, regardless of the data type of the fitted classes.
