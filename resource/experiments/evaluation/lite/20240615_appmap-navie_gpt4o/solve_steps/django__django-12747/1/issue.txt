QuerySet.Delete - inconsistent result when zero objects deleted
Description
	
The result format of the QuerySet.Delete method is a tuple: (X, Y) 
X - is the total amount of deleted objects (including foreign key deleted objects)
Y - is a dictionary specifying counters of deleted objects for each specific model (the key is the _meta.label of the model and the value is counter of deleted objects of this model).
Example: <class 'tuple'>: (2, {'my_app.FileAccess': 1, 'my_app.File': 1})
When there are zero objects to delete in total - the result is inconsistent:
For models with foreign keys - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {})
For "simple" models without foreign key - the result will be: <class 'tuple'>: (0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})
I would expect there will be no difference between the two cases: Either both will have the empty dictionary OR both will have dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.
