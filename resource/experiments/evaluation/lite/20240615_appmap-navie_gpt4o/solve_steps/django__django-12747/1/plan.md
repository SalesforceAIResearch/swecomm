**Title:** Normalize QuerySet.Delete Result When Zero Objects Deleted

**Problem:** 
The result format of the `QuerySet.Delete` method is inconsistent when zero objects are deleted. For models with foreign keys, the result is an empty dictionary, whereas for simple models without foreign keys, the result includes the model-label keys with zero values.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of this inconsistency lies in how the `QuerySet.Delete` method constructs its result when no objects are deleted. Specifically, it seems that the logic handling foreign key deletions is different from the logic handling simple deletions. This discrepancy leads to different output formats for the scenario where no deletions occur.

To resolve this issue, the logic for constructing the result tuple when zero objects are deleted should be normalized. This means ensuring that whether dealing with foreign keys or not, the result should follow a consistent format. Either both cases should yield an empty dictionary or both should yield a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.

**Proposed Changes:**
The changes to ensure consistency need to be applied to the relevant parts of the code handling the deletion logic. Based on the provided code selection, the `QuerySet` class in Django should be modified. While the exact file isn't provided in the selection, the deletion logic is typically handled within the ORM layers involving model operations. Since the modification pertains to result formation, it is likely linked to these ORM methods.

Here's a plan for the changes:
1. Identify the method that constructs the result tuple in the `QuerySet` class.
2. Modify the method to ensure it always returns a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values when no objects are deleted.

Given the context provided, these changes would be encapsulated in the Django ORM methods dealing with deletions, likely within the file `django/db/models/query.py`.

**File to Change:**
1. **File: `django/db/models/query.py`**
    - Locate the `delete` method or any method responsible for forming the result tuple of deletions.
    - Modify the logic such that when the total number of deletions (`X`) is zero, the resulting dictionary should include model-label keys with zero as their corresponding values.
    - Ensure the resulting tuple format is consistent regardless of the presence of foreign keys.

The specific modification would involve:
- Adding a check to ensure that if no deletions occur, the resulting dictionary is populated with model-label keys and zero values consistently across foreign keys and simple models.
  
By ensuring this, the result of the `QuerySet.Delete` method will be consistent and meet the expected behavior as described.
