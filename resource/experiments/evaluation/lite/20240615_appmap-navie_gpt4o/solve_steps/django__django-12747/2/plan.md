**Title**: Standardize Result Format of QuerySet.Delete When Zero Objects Deleted

**Problem**:
The `QuerySet.Delete` method returns inconsistent results when there are zero objects to delete. For models with foreign keys, the result is `(0, {})`, whereas for simple models without foreign keys, the result is `(0, {'model_label': 0})`. This discrepancy can lead to confusion and potential issues when handling deletion results in a consistent manner.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises due to how the deletion counters are aggregated and returned. When the deletion operation involves models with foreign keys, the method currently returns an empty dictionary. In contrast, for models without foreign keys, it returns a dictionary with model labels and zero values.

To standardize the result format, it is essential to ensure that the method returns a dictionary with model labels and zero values consistently, regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not.

The function in focus is likely responsible for counting and formatting the result of the delete operation, specifically within `django/db/models/deletion.py`. The identified segments of the code likely handle the initialization and finalization of the deleted objects counter, which needs standardization.

**Proposed Changes**:
The modifications should be made within the `delete` method and any helper methods that contribute to building the result tuple in `django/db/models/deletion.py`.

1. **Update deleted_counter Initialization**:
   Ensure the initialization of `deleted_counter` includes all involved models, even with a count of zero, before any deletions are made.

2. **Ensure Consistent Finalization**:
   Modify the code block responsible for returning the `deleted_counter` to ensure that all referenced models return a count, adhering to the specified format (even when zero items are deleted).

### Detailed Proposed Changes:
1. **File: `django/db/models/deletion.py`**
   - Identify the method responsible for returning the deletion result (presumably within `delete`).
   
2. **Initialization Phase**:
   - Prior to the main deletion logic, initialize `deleted_counter` with all involved model labels set to zero.
     

3. **Finalization Phase**:
   - Ensure to populate the `deleted_counter` dictionary with zero counts for models that had no deletions.
     

4. **Return Consistent Results**:
   - When returning the final result, ensure it uses the `deleted_counter` that includes zero counts for all models considered, thus standardizing the output format.
     

This approach provides uniformity in the method's output, ensuring no distinction between models with and without foreign keys when no objects are deleted.
