**Title**: Modify Migration Process to Change ForeignKey to ManyToManyField in Authors Model

**Problem**:
User wants to change the field `project_data_set` in the `Authors` model from a `ForeignKey` field to a `ManyToManyField`. The existing model contains a `unique_together` constraint involving this field. This constraint cannot be applied to a `ManyToManyField`, creating a value error when performing migrations.

**Analysis**:
The core of the issue lies in the `unique_together` constraint and the transition from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`. Since `ManyToManyField` cannot support `unique_together`, the migration should first remove the unique constraint involving `project_data_set` and execute a migration for this change. Then, a second migration should handle the field modification from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.

However, combining these changes into one seamless migration step requires careful planning. The `unique_together` constraint should be dropped before the field type change happens. This two-step approach appears to be the most reliable way of ensuring data integrity while fulfilling the application's requirements.

**Proposed Changes**:
### File: `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`

- Locate the operation classes (e.g., _AlterModelField_, _RemoveField_) in the file and proceed to describe the necessary changes:

1. **Modify AlterModelField**:
    - Update logic to check if the field being modified is part of any unique constraints.
    - If the field was part of a `unique_together` constraint, remove this constraint before proceeding with the alteration.

2. **Add Operation to Remove `unique_together` Constraint**:
    - Introduce a new migration operation that specifically removes the existing `unique_together` constraint involving the `project_data_set` field.

    First, implement a migration operation to drop `unique_together` constraints before changing the field type from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`:



- Then, add this operation to the migration that removes the unique constraint.

3. **Update Existing Migration Logic**:
    - Apply changes ensuring the new operation is executed before field type change.
    - Ensure migration processes involve applying these changes sequentially.

4. **Update Migration Plan**:
    - Create a migration file to remove `unique_together`.
    - Create a subsequent migration file to update the field from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.

**Example Migration Plan**:

In the operations section of your migration file:

This way, the `unique_together` constraint is removed first before the field type is modified, ensuring that the database constraints match before and after the migration.

By implementing these changes into `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, you will smooth out the migration process, eliminating errors from the invalid constraints during the field change. Thus, modifying this single file handles the issue efficiently.
