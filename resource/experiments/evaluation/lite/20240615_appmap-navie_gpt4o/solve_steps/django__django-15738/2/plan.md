**Title:** Modify migration plan to handle changing ForeignKey to ManyToManyField in `Authors` model

**Problem:** 
When attempting to change the `project_data_set` field in the `Authors` model from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField` while retaining the existing unique constraint on `project_data_set`, `state`, and `start_date`, an error occurs stating that there is a wrong number of constraints found for the combination of these fields during migration. The existing database is in production, thus deleting initial migrations to resolve this issue is not an option, and requires a solution that minimizes the impact on the existing database and ensures data integrity.

**Analysis:** 
The root cause of the problem stems from attempting to alter a column from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField` while it is part of a `unique_together` constraint. This requires two steps â€“ first, dropping the existing unique constraint, then changing the field type, and creating a new unique constraint if required. The proposed solution of creating two separate migrations ensures that the existing constraints are correctly handled without causing inconsistencies. However, the requirement is to achieve this goal in a single migration for a smoother deployment in a production environment.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File:** `django/db/migrations/executor.py`
    - Modify the `migrate` function to handle detection of intermediate states within a single migration plan.
    - Add logic to appropriately drop and recreate constraints when field types change from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.
    - Ensure that the application of changes to the database schema correctly reflects the changes in the state projection logic.

2. **Function Modification:**
    - **Function:** `migrate`
        - Ensure that the intermediate state handles the dropping of the `unique_together` constraint before altering the field type.
        - Once the field is altered, recreate the necessary constraints in the state model.
    
        Update logic to facilitate a single migration that:
        - Drops the existing `unique_together` constraint.
        - Alters the `project_data_set` field from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.
        - Optionally, recreate a new `unique_together` constraint if required.

    - **Methods Involved:** `merge_migration_states`, `_create_project_state`, `_migrate_all_forwards`
        - Ensure the state is consistent and reflects the changes in the `database` schema and `meta` options such as `unique_together`.
        
3. **Additional Logic Checks:**
    - Ensure that the `should_skip_detecting_model` accounts for changes that temporarily violate constraints, resolving to the final intended schema without errors.
    - Modify introspection logic to handle temporary constraint drops during field type changes.

By handling the migration in steps but within the same migration plan and updating state projection logic and schema alteration detection, this approach minimizes the disruption to the existing schema, ensuring data integrity, and achieving the desired field type change with minimal migration steps.

After making these changes, execute:
    - `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
    - `python3 manage.py migrate`
    
This should address the unique constraint errors and lead to the desired schema changes in a single migration.
