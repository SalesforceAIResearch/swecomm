**Title**: Update `Authors` Model and Remove `unique_together` Constraint

**Problem**: 
The user is attempting to change the `project_data_set` field in the `Authors` model from a `ForeignKey` to a `ManyToManyField`. The `unique_together` constraint currently applied to the `Authors` model, which involves the `project_data_set` field, is causing issues because `unique_together` constraints cannot be applied to `ManyToManyFields`. The user's initial approach involves making two migrations: one to remove the `unique_together` constraint and another to change the `project_data_set` field type. The user wishes to consolidate these changes into a single migration to streamline the process.

**Analysis**:
1. **Understanding the Model Changes**: The `Authors` model has `unique_together` involving the `project_data_set` field along with `state` and `start_date`. This constraint currently ensures the uniqueness of combined values of these fields. By changing `project_data_set` from a `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`, this constraint becomes invalid since `ManyToManyField` cannot be part of a `unique_together` constraint.
2. **Migration Strategy**: The goal is to remove the `unique_together` constraint first, followed by changing the field type from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`. Since constraints affect the database schema directly, these operations are not trivial. 
3. **Consolidated Migration**: Normally, making such complex changes in a single migration may not be straightforward because Django's migration system often requires a migration step for constraint removal before field type changes. However, we can instruct Django's migration framework to handle this in sequence within a single migration operation by creating a custom migration.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Update `Authors` Model**:
   - **File**: `models.py` (or wherever the `Authors` model is defined)
   - **Modifications**:
     - Remove `unique_together` from the `Meta` class.
     - Change the `project_data_set` field from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.
   
2. **Create a Custom Data Migration**:
   - **File**: `migrations/{new_migration_file}.py` (automatically determined by Django when you create a new migration)
   - **Modifications**:
     - Create a migration for removing the `unique_together` constraint first.
     - Follow it by changing the field type of `project_data_set` from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField` in the `Authors` model.

**Detailed Changes**:

1. **Modify `models.py`**:
   - Change `project_data_set` from `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField`.
   - Remove `unique_together` from the `Meta` class.

2. **Custom Migration**:
   - Create a new migration using `python3 manage.py makemigrations`.
   - In the autogenerated migration file, write custom operations to:
     - Remove the `unique_together` constraint.
     - Alter the `project_data_set` field type.

   
For example, you might see an autogenerated migration script which first alters the `Authors` model to remove the `unique_together` constraint, then modifies the `project_data_set` field:



After editing and saving the migration script, run:


This ensures the migration process is streamlined into a single step, removing the `unique_together` constraint and then changing the field type.

By following these steps, you ensure database integrity and minimize disruption during the migration process.
