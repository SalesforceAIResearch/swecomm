**Title**: Fix exec usage in Django management shell command to properly handle -c option

**Problem**: 
The Django `shell` command using the `-c` option for passing Python code with functions results in a `NameError`. This is because the `exec` built-in function is not provided with an adequate global dictionary, causing it to not recognize imported modules when executing the code.

**Analysis**: 
When using `python -m django shell -c`, the current implementation of the `exec` function in the `handle` method lacks a proper dictionary of globals, leading to the `NameError`. The `exec` function, by default, executes the code within the provided globals and locals namespaces. When this dictionary is empty, `exec` doesn't have the context it needs to understand or recognize already imported modules.

To fix this issue, we should provide `exec` with a dictionary that includes essential globals such as `__builtins__` and potentially other relevant global variables or functions. This will give `exec` the context it requires to resolve names like `django` correctly.

**Proposed Changes**:
Update the `handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/shell.py` to pass a suitable globals dictionary to `exec`.

1. **File: django/core/management/commands/shell.py**

   - Locate the `handle` method. 
   - Modify the `exec` function calls to include a dictionary of globals.

   **Detailed changes:**

   - Add an import for the builtins module to include it in the globals.
   - Modify the `exec` calls to include a dictionary containing the `__builtins__`, `__name__`, and potentially other necessary context variables as necessary.

   New `handle` method in `django/core/management/commands/shell.py` should look like this:

   

In this new implementation:
- `globals_dict` includes the `__builtins__`, providing the necessary built-in functions and variables to the executed code.
- `__name__` is set to `'__main__'` to mimic the execution environment of a script, which is useful for code that checks `if __name__ == '__main__'`.

By passing this `globals_dict`, the error "NameError: name 'django' is not defined" should be resolved, and the shell command should properly execute the provided Python code.
