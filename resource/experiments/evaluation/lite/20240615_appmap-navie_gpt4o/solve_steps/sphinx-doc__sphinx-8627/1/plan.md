**Title**: Enable autodoc to resolve `struct.Struct` type annotations

**Problem**
When `struct.Struct` is used in type annotations within Python code, Sphinx's `autodoc` extension fails to resolve the type, leading to the error message "class reference target not found: Struct". This issue does not occur with types from other modules, such as `pathlib.Path`, which resolve correctly.

**Analysis**
The root cause of this issue is that `autodoc` is unable to correctly interpret and resolve types that are imported from the `struct` module when generating documentation. This is likely due to the way the module and classes are being referenced within the Sphinx extensions.

To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that type hints referencing `struct.Struct` can be correctly located and interpreted. One potential solution involves configuring the `intersphinx` mapping in Sphinx to include references to the Python standard library documentation. This will allow Sphinx to properly resolve and link types from the standard library.

**Proposed Changes**

_File: conf.py_

1. **Update the `intersphinx_mapping` Configuration:**
   Ensure that `intersphinx` extension is correctly configured with the mapping for Python’s standard library. This will involve modifying the `conf.py` file to include the `intersphinx_mapping` setting that points to the Python documentation.
   
   - Locate the `conf.py` file within the documentation configuration for your project.
   - Add or modify `intersphinx_mapping` to include:
     
   - This ensures that references to standard library types such as `struct.Struct` can be resolved correctly by linking to their documentation in the Python standard library.

2. **Confirm `autodoc` Configuration:**
   Verify that the `autodoc` extension is appropriately set up in `conf.py` if it’s not already configured.
   
   - Ensure that `autodoc` and `intersphinx` are part of the `extensions` list:
     
   
3. **Document Reference Types Correctly:**
   - Ensure that `struct.Struct` and other type annotations are documented properly in the respective Python files.
   
By making these changes, Sphinx should be able to resolve `struct.Struct` type annotations correctly when generating the documentation, eliminating the "class reference target not found: Struct" error.

After implementing the proposed changes, regenerate your documentation to verify that `struct.Struct` is now being correctly resolved in the output.
