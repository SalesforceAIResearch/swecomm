**Title:** Fix autodoc to resolve `struct.Struct` type annotations

**Problem:**
When using Sphinx's autodoc extension, any `struct.Struct` type annotations result in a `class reference target not found: Struct` warning. This means that while generating documentation, autodoc fails to correctly resolve and document annotations involving `struct.Struct`.

**Analysis:**
The core issue is that autodoc's type resolution mechanism doesn't handle certain modules (like `struct`) the same way it handles others (like `pathlib`). The failure might be due to the way autodoc tries to look up and document these types.

To resolve this, autodoc needs better handling for standard library modules that might not be directly listed in the `intersphinx_mapping`. Adding support for the `struct` module in autodoc's type resolution would help in the correct resolution of `struct.Struct`.

**Proposed Changes:**
Modify `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py` to add logic that specifically handles the resolution of `struct.Struct` type annotations. 

1. **sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py:**
    - Add an additional branch in the type resolution logic that checks if the type being documented is from the `struct` module. If it is, then handle it accordingly.
    - Ensure that the new logic correctly resolves and formats the `struct.Struct` type for documentation.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Open `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`.

2. Locate the function responsible for handling type hints during the documentation generation. This is typically the function connected to the `autodoc-process-signature` event.

3. Add additional logic inside this function to check for types from the `struct` module:
    - Use `inspect` to determine if a type is a `struct.Struct`.
    - If it is, format and resolve the type annotation correctly so that it can be documented without causing a reference error.

4. Make sure to test these changes by running Sphinx with the provided `helloworld.py` example to ensure that `struct.Struct` type annotations are now resolved correctly.

By implementing this change, Sphinx's autodoc extension should be able to correctly handle and document functions with `struct.Struct` type annotations, preventing the warning and displaying the appropriate documentation. 

Remember to run the modified Sphinx on the provided example and verify that the output is as expected.
