### Title: Modify autodoc to Resolve `struct.Struct` Type Annotations 

### Problem
When `struct.Struct` is used in type annotations within Python modules, `autodoc` fails to resolve this type, resulting in an error: `class reference target not found: Struct`. This error does not occur with other standard library types like `pathlib.Path`.

### Analysis
The issue arises because `autodoc` is not correctly recognizing and resolving the `struct.Struct` type within the generated documentation. The root cause could be the way `autodoc` handles cross-references to certain types, particularly those in the `struct` module, as compared to types from other standard modules like `pathlib`.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that `autodoc` and the underlying mechanisms for type resolution in `Sphinx` are aware of `struct.Struct` and can properly resolve its references.

### Proposed Changes
The relevant changes should be made in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` file to enhance type resolution logic:

1. **Enhanced Type Resolution**:
   - Implement additional logic to explicitly handle types from the `struct` module similarly to other standard library modules.

#### Detailed Change Description for `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`:

1. **Locate the Type Resolution Logic**:
   - Find the section where `autodoc` attempts to resolve type annotations, typically within functions or methods that handle signature processing or object inspection.

2. **Enhanced Handling for `struct.Struct`**:
   - Add explicit checks and resolutions for `struct.Struct`:
     - Import necessary modules within the file's relevant context.
     - Modify the type resolution logic to recognize when a type belongs to the `struct` module and appropriately format the output.

#### Example Adjustments:
- Import `struct` appropriately.
- Ensure the resolution logic explicitly handles `struct.Struct` types, similar to how it handles `pathlib.Path`.

#### Pseudocode Overview:
- Import `struct` within the type resolution section.
- Enhance recognition logic:
  - If the type annotation is `struct.Struct`, ensure reference formatting aligns with other resolved types.
  
#### Improvements:
- The autodocâ€™s ability to correctly generate references for `struct.Struct` without user intervention.

### Files to be modified:
1. `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`
   - Additional logic in type resolution functions/methods to handle `struct.Struct`.

### Conclusion
Adjusting the type resolution logic in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to explicitly recognize `struct.Struct` in type annotations will ensure these references are correctly resolved in the generated documentation, matching the behavior of other standard library types like `pathlib.Path`.
