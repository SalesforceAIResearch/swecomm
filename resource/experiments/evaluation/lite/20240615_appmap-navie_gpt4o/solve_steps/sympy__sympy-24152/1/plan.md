**Title**: Fix Incomplete Expansion of TensorProduct with Scalar Factors

**Problem**:
The expansion of a `TensorProduct` object stops incomplete if summands in the tensor product factors have scalar factors. This results in improper expansions which can affect other functions relying on it, such as `qapply()`.

**Analysis**:
Upon calling `TensorProduct.expand(tensorproduct=True)`, the method `TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct()` is responsible for handling the expansion. The current implementation fails when the created `TensorProduct` object returns commutative scalar factors up front. In such cases, the constructor returns `Mul(c_factors, TensorProduct(..))`, leading to an incomplete expansion.

**Proposed Changes**:

Make modifications to the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct()` method within `sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py`. The goal is to split off commutative scalar factors from the tensor product returned.

1. **sympy/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.py**:
   - Modify the `for` loop in the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct()` method to handle the commutative and non-commutative parts correctly by updating the relevant sections of the code:
     - Split the returned `TensorProduct` into its commutative (scalar) and non-commutative parts using `args_cnc()`.
     - If the `nc_part` contains a `TensorProduct`, ensure it is properly expanded by calling `_eval_expand_tensorproduct()` on it.
     - Reconstruct the expanded term by multiplying the commutative parts with the non-commutative parts.

Detailed steps:
1. Inside the method `_eval_expand_tensorproduct()`:
2. After creating `tp = TensorProduct(*args[:i] + (aa,) + args[i + 1:])`, split it into `c_part` and `nc_part` using `tp.args_cnc()`.
3. Check if `nc_part` contains one element which is an instance of `TensorProduct`. If so, recursively call `_eval_expand_tensorproduct()` on that element.
4. Append the expanded term to `add_args` by combining the commutative part and the newly expanded non-commutative part using `Mul`.

By implementing these changes, the `TensorProduct.expand(tensorproduct=True)` method will properly handle tensor products with scalar factors, ensuring complete expansions.

Note: The exact changes needed have been highlighted in the original problem description, and these should be followed to ensure correct behavior.

Once these changes are made, it is advised to test the modifications thoroughly to ensure other functionalities relying on this method are unaffected.
