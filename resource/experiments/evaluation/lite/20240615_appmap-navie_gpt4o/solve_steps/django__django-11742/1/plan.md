**Title**: Add validation to ensure `max_length` fits longest choice in `Field.choices`

**Problem**: 
Currently, there's no validation in Django's form fields to ensure that the `max_length` attribute is sufficient to accommodate the longest value in `Field.choices`. This can lead to runtime errors when trying to save records with choices exceeding the specified `max_length`.

**Analysis**:
When defining a form field with both `max_length` and `choices`, it's crucial to ensure that the maximum length of any choice string does not exceed the `max_length` value. Otherwise, users might encounter validation errors at runtime, which can be frustrating and hard to debug.

To solve this, we need to add a check during the initialization of the field. This check should compare the length of each choice to the `max_length` and raise an error if any choice exceeds this length.

This involves the following steps:
1. Iterate through the `choices` during field initialization.
2. Compare the length of each choice string with the `max_length`.
3. Raise a `ValidationError` if any choice exceeds the `max_length`.

**Proposed Changes**:
**1. django/forms/fields.py**
   - Modify the `__init__` method in `ChoiceField` and related classes like `CharField`, `TypedChoiceField`, `TypedMultipleChoiceField`, etc., to include a validation check for `max_length` against the choices.

**2. ChoiceField class (django/forms/fields.py:759-788)**:
   - Add validation in the `__init__` method to check if the length of any choice exceeds `max_length`.

Specific Changes:
1. **In `ChoiceField` class**:
   - Edit `__init__` method to include logic for validating the length of choices.

2. **In `TypedChoiceField` class**:
   - Similar to `ChoiceField`, validate choices in the `__init__` method.

3. **In `TypedMultipleChoiceField` class**:
   - Apply a similar logic to ensure multiple choice selections are within the `max_length` constraint.

Detailed Change Description:
1. **`django/forms/fields.py`**:
   - `ChoiceField` and its subclasses should have additional code in the `__init__` method to iteratively check the length of each choice against the `max_length`.

Steps:
1. In the `__init__` method of `ChoiceField`, add a loop that iterates through `self.choices` and checks each choice string's length against `self.max_length`.

Here is an outline of what should be modified in the `__init__` method of `ChoiceField`:


2. Implement similar checks in the `TypedChoiceField` and `TypedMultipleChoiceField` classes.

This approach will ensure that `max_length` is valid for the given choices at the time of form field initialization, preventing runtime errors and improving the robustness of form validations in Django.
