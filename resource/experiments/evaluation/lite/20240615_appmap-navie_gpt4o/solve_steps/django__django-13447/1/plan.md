### Title
Make `_build_app_dict` method public and add model class to `app_list` context in admin views

### Problem
The `app_list` context in custom admin views currently contains a dictionary with serialized model information. The user needs direct access to the model class in the `app_list` for their custom view manipulations. Additionally, the `_build_app_dict` method, which generates this dictionary, is currently private and used internally by the `index` and `app_index` views. The user wants this method to be made public so it can be more widely utilized.

### Analysis
To provide direct access to the model class within the `app_list`, we need to modify the structure of the dictionaries returned by the `_build_app_dict` method. Instead of serializing the model information, we'll include the actual model class. We will also make `_build_app_dict` a public method, renaming it to `build_app_dict` so it can be accessed more freely.

Modifications will be focused on the private method `_build_app_dict` and the contexts constructed for the `index` and `app_index` views. Both views use the dictionaries generated by `_build_app_dict`, so changes need to ensure compatibility and consistency across these views.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Make `_build_app_dict` Method Public**:
   - In `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`, rename `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict`.
   - Update any internal calls to `_build_app_dict` to use the new `build_app_dict` name.

2. **Modify `build_app_dict` to Include Model Class**:
   - In `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`, update the logic in the `build_app_dict` method to include the actual model class in the dictionary under a new key, such as `model_class`.

3. **Update `index` and `app_index` Views to Use Modified Data**:
   - In `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`, update the logic in the `index` and `app_index` methods to handle the newly structured dictionaries that include the model class.

#### `django/contrib/admin/sites.py`

- **Change the Method Signature and References**:
  - Rename `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict`.
  
- **Modify Dictionary Structure to Include Model Class**:
  - Within the `build_app_dict` method, ensure the dictionary for each model includes the actual model class. For instance, in each `model_dict`, add a `"model_class": model`.

- **Update References in Views**:
  - In the `index` and `app_index` methods, update calls and context usage to reflect the new data structure that includes the model class.

These changes will ensure the `app_list` context in custom admin views contains the model class, providing greater flexibility for the user's custom view manipulations.
