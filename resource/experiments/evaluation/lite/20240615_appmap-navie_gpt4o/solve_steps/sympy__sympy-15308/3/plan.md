**Title**: Fix LaTeX Printing for Matrix Expressions to Properly Display Trace

**Problem**: 
The current implementation of LaTeX printing for matrix expressions fails to recognize and properly format the `Trace` function. Instead of rendering correctly via the LaTeX printer, it simply returns `Trace(A**2)`, without appropriately formatting the inner expression (e.g., `A^2`).

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue is that the custom LaTeX printer for `Trace` does not fall back to the standard LaTeX printer for sub-expressions within the `Trace` object. This means that any expression wrapped inside `Trace` is not being correctly processed by the LaTeX printer, leading to incorrect or non-LaTeX formatted output.

To resolve this, we need to modify the LaTeX representation of the `Trace` object so that it correctly uses the LaTeX printer for any sub-expressions.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py`
   - **Function**: `Trace._latex`
   - **Description**: 
     - Implement the `Trace` object's `_latex` method ensuring it calls the LaTeX printer on its sub-expressions. This will ensure that the inner matrix expressions are properly formatted.

2. **Steps**:
   - Add a `_latex` method to the `Trace` class.
   - Within this method, ensure to call the LaTeX printer on the sub-expression and format it correctly as part of the `Trace` output.

**Example**:
Within the `Trace` class in `sympy/matrices/expressions/trace.py`, add:



This method uses the LaTeX printer (`doprint`) on the internal expression of the `Trace` object and then formats the whole as a LaTeX `\mathrm{Tr}` function.

By making this adjustment, the LaTeX printer ensures that the inner expressions are properly processed and displayed within the `Trace` wrapper, providing the desired output such as `\mathrm{Tr}\left(A^2\right)` instead of `Trace(A**2)`.
