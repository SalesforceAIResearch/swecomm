**Title**: Fix LaTeX Printing for Matrix Expressions to Properly Display Trace with Inner Expressions

**Problem**: LaTeX printing for matrix expressions involving the trace function does not correctly format the expression. Specifically, it does not recognize the `Trace` and fails to correctly format the inner matrix expressions. As a result, the output is incorrectly displayed, as shown in the example. Instead of displaying `\text{Trace}(A^2)`, it shows `Trace(A**2)`.

**Analysis**: The underlying issue is with how the LaTeX printer handles the `Trace` object. The formatting does not dive into the inner expressions to properly format nested matrix expressions. The LaTeX printer should recognize `Trace` and format the internal matrix expressions appropriately.

To resolve this, we need to modify the LaTeX printing method for `Trace` objects to ensure that:
1. The `Trace` is recognized and properly formatted as `\text{Trace}`.
2. The inner matrix expressions are recursively passed to the LaTeX printer to ensure correct formatting.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/latex.py`

    Modify the LaTeX printer to add a custom print method for `Trace` objects. This method should properly format the `Trace` and recursively call the LaTeX printer for the internal matrix expressions.

   - Identify the part of the code handling the LaTeX formatting for general expressions.
   - Add a new method specifically to handle the `Trace` object.

    Suggested changes:
    
    * Add the import statement to import the `Trace` class at the beginning of the file if it's not already there.
    
    * Add the custom method for LaTeX printing:
      - Define a method `_print_Trace(self, expr)` inside the LaTeX printer class.
      - The method should format the `Trace` as `\\text{Trace}` and recursively format the inner matrix expression.

   Pseudocode for the method:
   

2. **File**: Any related files where the printer functionality is integrated.
   
   Ensure that the modified LaTeX printer correctly integrates into the wider matrix expression handling and that it is covered by various tests that include matrix expressions with trace.

By implementing these changes in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, the LaTeX printer will correctly recognize `Trace` and properly format the entire expression, resulting in the correct output such as `\text{Trace}(A^2)` for the given example.
