### Ignore `ignore-paths` with `--recursive=y` in PyLint

**Title:** Fix `--recursive=y` to honor `ignore-paths` setting in PyLint configuration.

**Problem:** When running PyLint with the `--recursive=y` option, the paths specified in the `ignore-paths` setting within the pyproject.toml configuration file are ignored. This leads to checks being performed on files that should be excluded, which is manifested by incorrect linting results on ignored paths.

**Analysis:** The root cause of this problem is that the `--recursive=y` option does not take into consideration the `ignore-paths` directive specified in the configuration file. In other words, when running recursively, the function responsible for walking through the directories and files does not filter out paths based on the defined patterns in `ignore-paths`.

To resolve this, ensure that the logic responsible for handling the recursive file search also checks and respects the `ignore-paths` settings. This requires altering the file traversal mechanism to exclude paths that match the specified patterns.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **pylint/pyreverse/utils.py:**
   - Locate the function or method responsible for file traversal when the `--recursive=y` option is used. Typically, this would involve finding the entry point for the recursive search or the function that walks through directories and files.
   - Modify this function to incorporate logic that reads the `ignore-paths` setting from the configuration.
   - Ensure that as directories and files are traversed, those matching the patterns in `ignore-paths` are excluded from the list before they are processed by PyLint.

2. **pylint/pyreverse/utils.py: Implementation details:**
   - Update the relevant function to read the `ignore-paths` setting using the existing mechanism for accessing configuration settings.
   - Introduce a condition within the directory traversal logic to skip any paths that match the `ignore-paths` patterns.
   - Make use of regex capabilities to match file paths against the patterns specified in `ignore-paths`.

By implementing these changes, the recursive file search will correctly respect the user-defined paths to ignore, preventing unwanted files from being analyzed and ensuring a cleaner, more accurate linting process.
