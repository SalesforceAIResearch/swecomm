**Title:** Fix `--recursive` Option to Honor `ignore-paths` Configuration

**Problem:** 
The `--recursive` option in Pylint does not respect the `ignore-paths` settings specified in `pyproject.toml`.

**Analysis:**
The core of the issue lies in the way Pylint processes files when the `--recursive` flag is used. The `ignore-paths` setting is designed to skip files and directories that match certain patterns specified in the `pyproject.toml` file. In your configuration, directories under `src/gen/` should not be analyzed. However, the recursive processing logic might be bypassing these filters, resulting in undesired files being checked.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the paths identified by the `--recursive` flag are filtered against the `ignore-paths` configuration. This requires a modification in the file selection logic within the Pylint utility functions handling file traversal and exclusion based on the configuration.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File:** `pylint/pyreverse/utils.py`
   - **Function:** The function responsible for handling the recursive file listing logic when `--recursive` is specified should be updated.
   - **Modification:** Update the logic to check each file against the `ignore-paths` regular expressions specified in the configuration before including them in the list of files to be analyzed.
     - Identify the current function or location where files are recursively listed.
     - Before adding a file to the list for analysis, check if it matches any pattern in `ignore-paths`.
     - Exclude the file from analysis if it matches the pattern.

2. **Steps to Implement:**
   - **Step 1:** Locate the function that handles recursive traversal of directories. It might be a utility function responsible for gathering file paths based on the `--recursive` flag.
   - **Step 2:** Retrieve the `ignore-paths` setting from the configuration file (`pyproject.toml` or any other configuration source being used).
   - **Step 3:** Implement a filtering mechanism that matches each identified file path against the patterns specified in `ignore-paths`.
   - **Step 4:** Ensure that files matching any ignore patterns are excluded from the list of files to be analyzed.

3. **Example Changes in Pseudocode (do not include actual code blocks):**
   - Identify the function responsible for recursive directory traversal.
   - Retrieve the ignore patterns:
     1. `ignore_patterns = get_ignore_patterns_from_config()`
   - Filter files based on these patterns:
     1. During the file listing:
        - For each file path identified:
          - If the file path matches any pattern in `ignore_patterns`, skip adding it to the analysis list.
          
By processing the file list in this manner, we ensure that all files identified during recursive traversal are properly filtered according to the `ignore-paths` configuration, thereby resolving the issue.

Ensure thorough testing after implementing the change to verify that paths specified in `ignore-paths` are indeed ignored during recursive file analysis.
