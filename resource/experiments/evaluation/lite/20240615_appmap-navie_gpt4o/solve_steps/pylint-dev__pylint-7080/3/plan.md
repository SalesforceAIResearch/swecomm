**Title**: Fix `--recursive` Flag to Respect `ignore-paths` Setting

**Problem**: 
When running Pylint with the `--recursive=y` flag, the `ignore-paths` configuration in `pyproject.toml` is not being respected, causing files that should be ignored (e.g., those matching the pattern `^src/gen/.*$`) to be incorrectly processed.

**Analysis**:
The `--recursive` flag in Pylint should recursively analyze directories while ignoring paths specified in the `ignore-paths` setting. The current behavior indicates that the `ignore-paths` setting is being bypassed or overridden when `--recursive=y` is used. This likely indicates a logical flaw in the part of the code handling recursive directory traversal or ignore path evaluation.

* The `ignore-paths` setting, defined in the configuration file, should be used to create a list of regex patterns to match and skip files or directories accordingly.
* The logic that handles the `--recursive` flag should first respect these patterns before processing files.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: `pylint/utils/file_state.py`**:
   - Locate the function/method responsible for recursive traversal of directories.
   - Ensure the function/method evaluates the paths against the `ignore-paths` regex patterns before adding them to the list of files to be processed.
   - Amend the logic to respect these patterns.

2. **Details**:
   - Ensure that the logic to read the `ignore-paths` from the configuration is correctly shared with the recursive file traversal method.
   - Add a check for each directory and file encountered during the recursive process to see if it matches any of the `ignore-paths` patterns.
   - If a match is found, skip adding that directory or file to the list for further processing or analysis by Pylint.

**Example of Logic Changes**:
- **Function responsible for reading ignore-paths**: 
  Ensure it continues to return correct patterns.
  
- **Function responsible for recursive file collection**:
   Before adding a file or directory to the list, ensure it is not matched by the ignore-paths patterns.

These changes ensure that the specified paths in `ignore-paths` are always respected, regardless of the flags used.

**Final Notes**:
While making these changes, ensure that the logic scales well to handle various edge cases such as:
- Nested directories specified in `ignore-paths`.
- Combination with other flags that might be impacted by this logic.
