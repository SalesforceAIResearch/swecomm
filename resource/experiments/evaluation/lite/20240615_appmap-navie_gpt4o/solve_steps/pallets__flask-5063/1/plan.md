**Title**: Update `flask routes` Command to Display Subdomain Information

**Problem**: 
The current implementation of the `flask routes` command lists all registered routes but does not display which routes are assigned to which subdomains. This makes it difficult for developers to quickly determine which endpoint belongs to which subdomain.

**Analysis**: 
To enhance the `flask routes` command output, the solution requires additional logic that associates each route with its corresponding subdomain and server name. This can be accomplished by modifying the `routes_command` method in the `cli.py` file. 

The `routes_command` currently iterates through the application's URL rules and prints them out in a tabular format. We need to add logic to fetch the subdomain information from each rule and include this data in the displayed output.

**Proposed Changes**: 

1. **File**: `src/flask/cli.py`
   
   **Function**: `routes_command`

   **Changes**:
   - Import necessary modules and update the `routes_command` function to fetch subdomain and server information.
   - Extend the logic in `routes_command` to output the `DOMAIN` column by combining `subdomain` and `SERVER_NAME`.
  
   Descriptive steps for modifications:
   
   1. **Import Necessary Modules**: 
      Ensure that the `request` and `current_app` are imported at the beginning of `cli.py`.
   
   2. **Extract Subdomain Information**:
      Modify the logic inside the `routes_command` function to:
      - Iterate over each rule.
      - Fetch the subdomain and server name associated with the rule.
      - Combine them to form the full domain.

   3. **Format Output Table**: 
      Update the output table to include a new column for the `Domain`.

Detailed description of the changes:

1. **Extend the `routes_command` function to include subdomain and domain information**:
    
    * Adjust the method signature if necessary to accept new options or parameters.
    * Inside the loop where the rules are processed, extract the `subdomain` information from each rule.
    * Use the application's `SERVER_NAME` configuration to construct the full domain for each rule.
    * Append this information to the output.
