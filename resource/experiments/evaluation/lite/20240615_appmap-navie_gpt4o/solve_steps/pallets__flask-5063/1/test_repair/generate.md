To address the two failed tests (`TestRoutes::test_simple` and `TestRoutes::test_all_methods`), it appears that the issues might be related to the behavior of route sorting and method handling in the `routes_command` function. This function is responsible for displaying routes registered in the Flask app.

Based on the test error, one possible adjustment is to ensure the `routes_command` handles the sorting and method display accurately.

Let's explore the changes required to fix the failed test cases:

1. **Test 1: `TestRoutes::test_simple`**
2. **Test 2: `TestRoutes::test_all_methods`**

### Change 1: Improve `routes_command` for Accurate Route Sorting and Method Display

#### Current `routes_command` implementation:
```python
@with_appcontext
def routes_command(sort: str, all_methods: bool) -> None:
    """Show all registered routes with endpoints and methods."""

    rules = list(current_app.url_map.iter_rules())
    if not rules:
        click.echo("No routes were registered.")
        return

    ignored_methods = set(() if all_methods else ("HEAD", "OPTIONS"))

    if sort in ("endpoint", "rule"):
        rules = sorted(rules, key=attrgetter(sort))
    elif sort == "methods":
        rules = sorted(rules, key=lambda rule: sorted(rule.methods))  # type: ignore

    rule_methods = [
        ", ".join(sorted(rule.methods - ignored_methods))  # type: ignore
        for rule in rules
    ]

    server_name = current_app.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")

    headers = ("Endpoint", "Methods", "Rule", "Domain")
    widths = (
        max(len(rule.endpoint) for rule in rules),
        max(len(methods) for methods in rule_methods),
        max(len(rule.rule) for rule in rules),
        max(len(server_name) for rule in rules),
    )
    widths = [max(len(h), w) for h, w in zip(headers, widths)]
    row = "{{0:<{0}}}  {{1:<{1}}}  {{2:<{2}}}  {{3:<{3}}}".format(*widths)

    click.echo(row.format(*headers).strip())
    click.echo(row.format(*("-" * width for width in widths)))

    for rule, methods in zip(rules, rule_methods):
        subdomain = rule.subdomain or ""
        domain = f"{subdomain}.{server_name}".strip(".")
        click.echo(row.format(rule.endpoint, methods, rule.rule, domain).rstrip())
```

### Suggested modifications in `routes_command`:
1. **Handling `sort` accurately to reflect different criteria**.
2. **Updating method handling to ensure the correct display**.

Here's the suggested update:

        rules = sorted(rules, key=attrgetter(sort))

        rules = sorted(rules, key=lambda rule: sorted(rule.methods))  # type: ignore

    rules = list(current_app.url_map.iter_rules())
    if not rules:
        click.echo("No routes were registered.")
        return

    ignored_methods = set(() if all_methods else ("HEAD", "OPTIONS"))
    
    if sort not in ("endpoint", "methods", "rule", "match"):
        click.echo(f"Invalid sort option: {sort}")
        return

    if sort == "endpoint":
        rules.sort(key=attrgetter("endpoint"))
    elif sort == "methods":
        rules.sort(key=lambda rule: sorted(rule.methods - ignored_methods))  # type: ignore
    elif sort == "rule":
        rules.sort(key=attrgetter("rule"))
    elif sort == "match":
        rules.sort(key=lambda rule: rule.match("/"))

    rule_methods = [
        ", ".join(sorted(rule.methods - ignored_methods))  # type: ignore
        for rule in rules
    ]
]]></modified>
</change>
```

This change ensures:
1. **Sorting behaviors are explicitly defined**:
    - Handling of sorting by "endpoint", "methods", "rule", and "match" has been clarified.
2. **Handling invalid values for sort**:
    - An invalid sort option will provide feedback to the user.

After implementing these changes, running the tests should pass accurately if the test cases are solely failing due to sorting or method handling issues.

Please apply the changes and re-run your tests. If other issues persist, feel free to share those so that further improvements can be suggested.
