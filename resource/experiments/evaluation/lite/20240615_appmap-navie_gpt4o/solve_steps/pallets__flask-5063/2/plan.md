**Title**: Modify Flask routing to include subdomain information in route display

**Problem**: 
When the `flask routes` command is used to display available routes, it does not indicate which routes correspond to specific subdomains. This lack of information makes it difficult to determine which routes are assigned to which subdomains without manually checking the configuration.

**Analysis**:
The problem lies in the current Flask `flask routes` implementation, which does not account for subdomain details when displaying route information. To fix this, the subdomain information needs to be included in the route display.

To achieve this, modifications will be necessary in the part of the codebase that handles the extraction and display of route information. Specifically, the logic that iterates through the registered routes and formats them for output needs to be extended to include subdomain data.

**Proposed Changes**:
The following modifications should be made to one specific part of the Flask codebase to include subdomain information in the output of `flask routes`:

1. **File**: `src/flask/cli.py`
   - **Function**: Modify the function that generates the route list for display (likely related to the command that handles `flask routes`).
   - **Changes**:
     - Before displaying each route, identify the subdomain for that route. This can be done by inspecting the options of the blueprint or the app (if subdomains are set at the app level).
     - Extend the output format to include a 'Domain' column. This will require adjusting the header of the displayed table and the row data for each route.

2. **Specific changes**:
   - Inside the relevant function, where the route data is collected (e.g., `get_routes` or a similar function):
     - Check for subdomain information associated with the route.
     - Include this subdomain information in the route data structure.
   - Update the display logic to insert a 'Domain' column and include the gathered subdomain data when printing each route.

Example modification logic might look like:
- Extract subdomain information from the route's blueprint.
- Append subdomain information as a new field in the route descriptor.
- Format the output such that the subdomains are displayed in alignment with the respective routes.

By implementing these changes, the `flask routes` command will be enhanced to show domain information as requested, making it easier for developers to see at a glance which routes are associated with which subdomains. 

Please proceed with making these changes to `src/flask/cli.py`. If further adjustments are required or testing reveals additional requirements, the implementation can be iteratively improved.
