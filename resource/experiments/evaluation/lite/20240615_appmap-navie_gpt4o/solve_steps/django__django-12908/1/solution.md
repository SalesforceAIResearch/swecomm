Based on the given issue description, we need to modify the `get_queryset` method within `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py` to handle proper wrapping of union queries with distinct clauses to ensure correct SQL query generation.

Let's apply the specific changes discussed.

```

These changes ensure that if both `union()` and `distinct()` are involved, the query appropriately wraps the unioned querysets in a distinct clause, thus addressing the issue described.
