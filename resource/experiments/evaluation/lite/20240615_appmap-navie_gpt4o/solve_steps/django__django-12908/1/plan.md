**Title**: Modify queryset union to properly apply distinct()

**Problem**: 
When using `annotate()` on different querysets and then performing a `union()`, applying `distinct()` does not affect the combined queryset as expected. The distinct query is not wrapping the union query correctly, which results in incorrect results from the database.

**Analysis**:
The issue is arising because `distinct()` in Django modifies the SQL query to add a `DISTINCT` clause. However, when used in conjunction with a `union()` operation, the `DISTINCT` clause does not appropriately wrap around the unioned subqueries. Instead, it applies the clause on the flattened results of the union, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

The correct SQL statement should wrap the union subqueries with a `DISTINCT ON` clause. This ensures that the distinct operation is applied correctly on the results of the union. We need to adjust the Django ORM logic to generate the appropriate SQL query when `distinct` is used after a `union`.

**Proposed Changes**:
We need to modify the relevant function within `django/contrib/admin/views/main.py` that handles the queryset construction and provides the ability to handle distinct operations following unions.

1. **django/contrib/admin/views/main.py**:
    - We need to intercept the case where both `union()` and `distinct()` are involved and ensure that the resulting SQL query uses `DISTINCT ON` properly to wrap the unioned subqueries.
    - Modify the `get_queryset` method to construct a subquery if `distinct` is applied after a `union`. This involves creating a new subquery and altering the order of operations.

### Specific Modifications:
1. **Modifying the `get_queryset` Method**:
    - Identify the parts of the query that involve `union()` and `distinct()`.
    - Wrap the unioned querysets in a subquery if distinct fields are specified.
    - Adjust the handling of `DISTINCT` to apply it on the wrapped union subquery instead of on the end result.

Example Steps:


Changes in **django/contrib/admin/views/main.py**:
- Locate the sections dealing with queryset union operations.
- Ensure that `distinct` operations are correctly applied when dealing with unioned querysets.
- Wrap unioned subqueries in a new query that applies the `distinct` clause properly.

By focusing on modifying the queryset construction logic to generate the correct SQL query, we can ensure that distinct operations behave as expected even after union operations. This adjustment guarantees that the overlying SQL structure follows the correct syntax and yields the expected distinct results.
