### Title

Allow `FilePathField` path to accept a callable

### Problem

When using Djangoâ€™s `FilePathField`, the `path` attribute is currently static and evaluated when migrations are made. This path is resolved based on the machine the migration was created on, causing discrepancies when running the migration on different environments (e.g., development versus production) since the path is hardcoded into the migration file.

### Analysis

The current implementation of Django's `FilePathField` evaluates the `path` argument immediately and stores it in the database schema. To make the `path` dynamic and environment-aware, we need to allow `path` to be a callable. This way, the actual path can be determined during runtime based on the current environment, avoiding issues caused by different file structures on various machines.

The change should ensure that the callable, when provided, is executed to get the latest path whenever necessary. This approach will allow the `FilePathField` to remain flexible and adaptable to different environments without requiring manual intervention in migration files.

### Proposed Changes

1. **Modify the Field Initialization in FilePathField Class**:
   - Adjust the `__init__` method of `FilePathField` to accept a callable for the `path` parameter.
   - Add a check to determine if the path is callable. If it is, store it as is; otherwise, resolve the path immediately.

2. **Adapt Methods to Use Callable Path**:
   - Wherever the path is used within the `FilePathField` methods, update the logic to handle callables.

### Changes in Specific File

#### File: `django/db/models/fields/files.py`

1. **Update __init__ method**:
   - Modify the existing `FilePathField.__init__` method to handle a callable for the `path` argument.

    
  
2. **Add a Method to Get the Path**:
    - Add a private method `_get_path` to resolve the actual path during runtime if the path is callable.

    

3. **Update Methods Using Path**:
    - Change any reference to `self._path` to use `self._get_path()` to ensure the path is dynamically evaluated.

    Example:
    

These changes will allow the `FilePathField` to accept a callable for the `path` argument, dynamically evaluating the path whenever it is accessed and thereby solving the issue of static paths hardcoded in migration files.
