**Title**: Allow `FilePathField` path to accept a callable

**Problem**: The `FilePathField` in Django currently does not accept a callable for its `path` parameter. This limitation causes issues in scenarios where the file paths need to be dynamically resolved based on the environment (e.g., different paths for development, staging, and production environments). When running `./manage.py makemigrations`, the path is evaluated and stored as a static string in the migration files, leading to discrepancies between different environments and necessitating manual adjustments.

**Analysis**:
1. **Root Cause**: The `FilePathField`'s `path` parameter is strictly a string that gets evaluated at the time of migration creation. This behavior causes problems when paths need to be runtime-dynamic, as is the case with environment-based configurations.
2. **Proposed Solution**: Modify the `FilePathField` to accept a callable for its `path` parameter. When this is the case, the callable will be invoked to get the actual path value when needed, rather than at migration creation time.

**Proposed Changes**:
The necessary changes can be made in the file `django/db/models/fields/files.py`.

1. **Modify the `FilePathField` constructor**:
   - Update the constructor to check if the `path` parameter is callable. Store the callable if it is; otherwise, process it as a string.

2. **Update methods to handle callables**:
   - Wherever the `path` property is used, add logic to evaluate the callable if the `path` is indeed a callable.

### Detailed Changes:

#### `django/db/models/fields/files.py`

1. **Constructor Modification in `FilePathField` Class**:
   - In the `FilePathField` constructor, check if `path` is a callable and store it accordingly.

2. **Path Property Handling**:
   - Modify any function or method within `FilePathField` that utilizes the `path` property to evaluate callables.

**Constructor Modification in `FilePathField` Class**:
- Modify the `__init__` method to handle callables for the `path` parameter.

**Path Usage Handling**:
- Modify the existing methods in the `FilePathField` class where the `path` property is utilized to check if `path` is callable and evaluate it if needed.

Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Constructor modification**:
   - Modify the `__init__` method of `FilePathField` to store a callable if provided.

2. **Override methods to handle callable**:
   - Override necessary methods to evaluate the callable when determining the path.



By implementing these changes, the `FilePathField` will be more flexible and capable of handling dynamic paths based on different environments, thus eliminating the need for manual changes in migration files.

**Note**: Make sure that the changes are reflected correctly in your models, and thoroughly test to ensure no breakages occur due to the updated functionality.
