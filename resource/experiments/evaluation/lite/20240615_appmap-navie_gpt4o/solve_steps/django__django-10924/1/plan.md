**Title**: Allow `FilePathField` path in Django models to accept a callable

**Problem**:
The current implementation of the `FilePathField` in Django models only accepts a string as the `path` argument. This causes issues when paths to local files vary across different environments (e.g., development vs production). Developers need to manually adjust migrations to ensure the correct path is used based on the environment, which is cumbersome and prone to errors.

**Analysis**:
To solve this issue, we need to modify the `_check_path` method within the `FilePathField` class to handle callable paths. When the path is callable, it should be executed to retrieve the actual path. This change will allow dynamic resolution of file paths based on different environments.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/fields/files.py`

   **Modify the `_check_path` method**:
   - Update the `_check_path` method to check if the `path` attribute is callable. If callable, execute it to get the actual path.
   - If the `path` is not callable, proceed with the current behavior of checking the string path.

   **Detailed changes**:
   - In the method where the `path` is being validated/used, add a condition to check if `path` is callable.
   - Retrieve the actual path by calling the callable if it is callable, else use the string value.

With this modification, the `FilePathField` will support callables for the `path` attribute, thus allowing dynamic path resolution based on the environment settings.

**Example of the modified method**:
Without modifying the code directly here, the logic should:
1. Check if `self.path` is callable.
2. If `callable(self.path)`, set `actual_path = self.path()`.
3. If not callable, use `actual_path = self.path`.
4. Proceed with the existing logic using `actual_path`.

By implementing these changes, the `FilePathField` will become more flexible and easier to manage across different environments.
