**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with

Allow FilePathField path to accept a callable.
Description
	
I have a special case where I want to create a model containing the path to some local files on the server/dev machine. Seeing as the place where these files are stored is different on different machines I have the following:
import os
from django.conf import settings
from django.db import models
class LocalFiles(models.Model):
	name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
	file = models.FilePathField(path=os.path.join(settings.LOCAL_FILE_DIR, 'example_dir'))
Now when running manage.py makemigrations it will resolve the path based on the machine it is being run on. Eg: /home/<username>/server_files/example_dir
I had to manually change the migration to include the os.path.join() part to not break this when running... (864)
