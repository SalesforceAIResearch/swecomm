**Title**: Prevent `Dataset.update` from Eagerly Evaluating Chunked Dask DataArrays

**Problem**: 
When using `Dataset.update` to update a chunked Dask `DataArray`, it loses its chunking and is evaluated eagerly.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue lies in the `Dataset.update` method. When it processes updates, `DataArray` objects that are chunked using Dask are inadvertently coerced into eager evaluation, resulting in a loss of chunking. 

To fix this, the update mechanism needs to be adjusted to retain the chunking of Dask `DataArray` objects. By investigating the handling of such objects in the `Dataset.update` method, we can prevent them from being evaluated eagerly, maintaining their chunked status throughout the update process.

**Proposed Changes**:
The most relevant changes should be made to the `dataset_update_method` function in `xarray/core/merge.py`.

1. Modify the `dataset_update_method` function:
   - Ensure that when updating a `Dataset` with another `Dataset` or mapping-like object, the chunking information is preserved for `DataArray` objects.
   - Adjust the code to recognize and handle `DataArray` objects specifically, avoiding triggering their evaluations.

**Changes in `xarray/core/merge.py`**:

- **Function: `dataset_update_method`**
  1. Within this function, check if the objects being merged contain `DataArray` instances with chunking information.
  2. Ensure that these chunked `DataArray` instances are updated in the dataset without losing their chunked nature.

  Detailed steps:
  - Iterate over the items in the `other` mapping.
  - For each `DataArray`, check if it is chunked.
  - If it is chunked, ensure that its chunking information is preserved during the merge process.
  - Merge the variables and update the dataset without causing the chunked arrays to be evaluated eagerly.

Example:



By following these steps, we ensure that chunking information for Dask `DataArray` objects is preserved during the update, preventing unintended eager evaluation and maintaining the desired chunked state.
