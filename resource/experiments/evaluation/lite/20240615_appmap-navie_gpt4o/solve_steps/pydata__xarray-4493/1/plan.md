### Title: Update Dataset.update to Maintain Dask Chunks in DataArray

### Problem
When using `Dataset.update` to update a chunked Dask `DataArray`, the `DataArray` loses its chunking and evaluates the values eagerly. The expectation is that the `DataArray` should maintain its chunking after the update.

### Analysis
The root cause of this issue lies in how `Dataset.update` interacts with dask-backed `DataArray` objects. Specifically, the update operation needs to ensure that it properly maintains the chunk structure of the original `DataArray` when updating elements of an existing `Dataset`.

### Proposed Changes
Focus on updating the `Dataset.update` method within the `xarray/core/dataset.py` file to ensure that chunking of a Dask `DataArray` is preserved during the update process.

1. **Locate `Dataset.update` method in `xarray/core/dataset.py`**:
   - Investigate and confirm how `Dataset.update` currently handles the input `update_dict`.

2. **Modify Logic to Preserve Chunks**:
   - Ensure the method checks if the incoming `DataArray` is Dask-backed (i.e., uses dask arrays as its underlying data).
   - When dask-backed `DataArray` objects are detected, ensure that their chunking metadata is preserved during the update.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Inside `Dataset.update`, add a mechanism to check the type of data inside `update_dict`.
   - If the data is a `DataArray` backed by a dask array, update the `DataArray` within the `Dataset` without triggering a compute operation that would cause eager evaluation.

### Changes Required
**File**: `xarray/core/dataset.py`
1. **Modify `Dataset.update` method**:
   - Add logic to verify whether the `DataArray` being updated is chunked using dask.
   - Preserve the chunk attributes while performing the update.

#### Detailed Change Description:
- **Step 1**: Retrieve the current implementation of `Dataset.update`.
- **Step 2**: Inspect each item in the `update_dict` to determine if it is a dask-backed `DataArray`.
- **Step 3**: If the item is a dask-backed `DataArray`, ensure its chunking structure remains unchanged.
- **Step 4**: Update the `DataArray` in the `Dataset` while maintaining its chunk structure.

#### Example Pseudocode:
- Before updating:
   - `if isinstance(update_dict[key], xr.DataArray) and dask.is_dask_collection(update_dict[key].data):`
      - Preserve chunk structure.

According to the provided context and problem, these changes should ensure that the `DataArray` retains its chunking after the `Dataset.update` operation. Be sure to review and validate the updated method to ensure it works as expected in the context of both dask and non-dask `DataArray` objects.

Once the code is updated, thorough testing should be conducted to verify the behavior under various scenarios involving chunked and non-chunked data arrays.

### Conclusion
By modifying the `Dataset.update` method to recognize and preserve dask-backed `DataArray` chunking, the issue of eager evaluation can be avoided, thus maintaining the integrity and efficiency of operations on large datasets.
