**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

Solve the problem as if you... (2655)
1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**
This is a description of the problem that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused ond describing the problem fully as a software Issue, aka Ticket.


The problem statement will be prefixed with "[problem-statement]"
1ms [prompt] system: **The user's code selection**

The user is asking about specific lines of code that they have selected in their code editor.

The code selection will be prefixed with "[code-selection]"
1ms [prompt] system: 
Focus the plan on modifying exactly one file.

Do not modify test case files. Test case files are those that include "test", "tests" in their paths,
or match the patterns "*_test.py" or "test_*.py".

DO choose the one most relevant file to modify.
DO NOT modify any other files.
DO NOT choose a test case file.

DataSet.update causes chunked dask DataArray to evalute its values eagerly 
**What happened**:
Used `DataSet.update` to update a chunked dask DataArray, but the DataArray is no longer chunked after the update.

**What you expected to happen**:
The chunked DataArray should still be chunked after the update

**Minimal Complete Verifiable Example**:

```python
foo = xr.DataArray(np.random.randn(3, 3), dims=("x", "y")).chunk()  # foo is chunked
ds = xr.Dataset({"foo": foo, "bar": ("x", [1, 2, 3])})  # foo is still chunked here
ds  # you can verify that foo is chunked
```
```python
update_dict = {"foo": (("x", "y"), ds.foo[1:, :]), "bar": ("x", ds.bar[1:])}
update_dict["foo"][1]  # foo is still chunked
```
```python
ds.update(update_dict)
ds  # now foo is no longer chunked... (2323)
