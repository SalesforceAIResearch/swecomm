**Title:** Fix pretty printing for MatAdd to properly handle string arguments from MatrixSymbol

**Problem:** 
The pretty-printing functionality for `MatAdd` is currently encountering an error due to the usage of `sympify` for handling string arguments from `MatrixSymbol`. This behavior leads to a `SympifyError` when it encounters a syntax that it cannot parse, as evidenced by the error message when attempting to pretty print matrix expressions containing symbols with special characters.

**Analysis:**
The root of the issue lies in how the `pretty.py` module's `_print_MatAdd` method treats the arguments of `MatrixSymbol`. The erroneous use of `sympify` is causing it to misinterpret certain symbol names, such as `y*`, leading to a `SyntaxError`. Furthermore, the code seems to be making assumptions about how negative arguments should be printed, which is incorrect and not robust against all possible valid inputs.

The method currently attempts to sympify the argument and check if it is negative by inspecting the first argument in the `args` attribute of the item in `MatAdd`. This approach is fragile and unnecessary for determining pretty-print formatting.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **Modify the `_print_MatAdd` method:** 
    - Instead of sympifying the arguments to check for negativity using `item.args[0].is_negative`, we should directly work with the matrix symbols and their inherent properties/representations.
    - Adjust the logic to handle the presence of symbols with special characters and ensure correct formatting without relying on potentially erroneous assumptions about the structure of the arguments.

*File: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`*

- Locate the `_print_MatAdd` method.
- Change the code that currently tries to sympify the arguments and instead implement a direct approach to checking and formatting the output correctly.

**Detailed Changes:**

1. **Update `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`:**

    - Around line 828 in the `_print_MatAdd` method:
        - Remove the use of `S(item.args[0]).is_negative`.
        - Implement a different method to determine if an argument should be prefixed with a negative sign, likely by direct inspection of the symbols and their signs.

2. **Ensure Robustness:**
    - Add safeguards to handle symbols with special characters correctly without causing syntax errors.

By directly managing the matrix symbols and avoiding the unnecessary transformation, the printing method will become more robust and capable of handling a wider variety of valid expressions.

Here is a step-by-step plan for what the changes should encompass:

1. **Remove `sympify` call**:
    - Eliminate the line `if S(item.args[0]).is_negative:` and associated lines that attempt to parse and check negativity through `sympify`.
  
2. **Check Symbol Negativity Directly**:
    - Instead, use matrix properties or a more appropriate handling function to determine the sign of the matrix symbol arguments.

3. **Format Output Correctly**:
    - Properly format the output of `MatAdd` to include the correct signs without removing the symbol if the negative sign is present.

By making these adjustments, the issue of `SympifyError` due to special characters in symbol names will be mitigated, ensuring the correct pretty-printing of matrix addition operations.
