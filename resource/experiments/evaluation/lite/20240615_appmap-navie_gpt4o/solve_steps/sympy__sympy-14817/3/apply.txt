Based on the issue description, we need to modify the `_print_MatAdd` method in the `PrettyPrinter` class to avoid using `sympify` and correctly handle the addition of negative terms. 

Here's how you can achieve this:

1. **Locate the `_print_MatAdd` method:**
    - In the provided file `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`.

2. **Remove the use of `sympify`:**
    - Directly handle the matrix symbols and their arguments without relying on `sympify`.

3. **Modify the argument handling logic:**
    - Ensure that negative terms are appropriately represented and `+` is added between terms as necessary.

Let's implement these changes step-by-step:

### Step-by-Step Changes:

1. **Remove the use of `sympify`:**
   - Check for negative values using `_coeff_isneg()` which is already imported in the given code.
   
2. **Ensure proper handling of positive and negative terms:**
   - Always add a space and a `+` sign between positive terms and their preceding term unless it is the first term.
   - Add a space before negative terms but ensure the `-` sign is properly represented.

Here is the **modified code**:

            s = pform     # First element
        else:
            if S(item.args[0]).is_negative:
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' '))
                pform = self._print(item)
            else:
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' + '))
            s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, pform))

    return s

        pform = self._print(item)
        if s is None:
            s = pform     # First element
        else:
            if _coeff_isneg(item):
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' '))
            else:
                s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, ' + '))
            s = prettyForm(*stringPict.next(s, pform))

    return s
]]></modified>
</change>
```

This change ensures that:
1. We no longer use `sympify` which was the root cause of the error with invalid symbols.
2. The mathematical correctness of representation, especially the proper handling of negative terms in matrix addition, is maintained.
3. Positive terms are properly preceded by a `+`. 

This should solve the issue mentioned in the problem description. You can now proceed to test this modification to ensure it behaves as expected.
