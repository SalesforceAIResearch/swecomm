**Title**: Modify `_print_MatAdd` to avoid using `sympify` on MatrixSymbol arguments 

**Problem**: The `_print_MatAdd` function in the `PrettyPrinter` class currently attempts to use `sympify` on string arguments from `MatrixSymbol` objects. This leads to a `SympifyError` when the string contains invalid symbols, such as `'*'` in `MatrixSymbol('y*', n, n)`. Additionally, the existing code logic seems to omit the `+` sign when the first argument is negative, which can lead to incorrect pretty printing of expressions.

**Analysis**: 
- **Root Cause**: The main issue arises because using `sympify` to check if the first argument is negative is inappropriate for non-standard symbols in matrix operations, which can contain invalid characters leading to parsing errors. Moreover, the current logic assumes that negative arguments should omit the `+` sign, which is not a standard way of handling matrix addition pretty printing.
- **Solution Strategy**:
  1. **Remove the `sympify` call**: Instead of attempting to parse the string arguments from `MatrixSymbol`, the function should check for negativity using an alternative approach that understands matrix addition context.
  2. **Maintain Correct Addition Representation**: The function should ensure that all arguments are correctly represented in the final pretty-printed output. This means ensuring that both positive and negative arguments are appropriately displayed with their signs and that the `+` symbol is correctly retained or omitted based on the argument signs.

**Proposed Changes**:
- **File to Modify**: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`
  
1. **Identify the `_print_MatAdd` Method**:
   - Locate the `_print_MatAdd` method inside the `PrettyPrinter` class.
   
2. **Remove Use of `sympify`**:
   - Remove the use of `sympify` to handle string arguments from `MatrixSymbol`. Instead, process arguments directly within the function.

3. **Modify Argument Handling Logic**:
   - Implement proper handling for all arguments such that negatives retain the `-` sign, and positives appropriately display the `+` sign where needed.
   
   Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on the changes:
   - Ensure to directly handle the matrix symbols and their arguments without relying on `sympify` to parse them.
   - Change the logic to determine the sign representation so that it correctly adds or omits the `+` based on context.
   
Specific modifications to the code base would include the following steps:

1. **Modify the `_print_MatAdd` function**: 
    - Remove the `sympify` call.
    
    

2. **Test and Validate**:
    - Ensure the method now handles matrix expressions correctly without raising errors due to invalid symbols.
    - Validate that the method correctly prints positive and negative arguments.

By implementing these changes, `_print_MatAdd` will correctly handle `MatrixSymbol` arguments without causing `SympifyError` and will also correctly print the symbols without undesired omissions of the `+` sign.
