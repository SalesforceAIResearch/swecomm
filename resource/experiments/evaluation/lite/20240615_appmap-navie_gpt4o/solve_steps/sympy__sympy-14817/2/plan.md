**Title**: Fix Pretty Printing Issue in MatAdd by Avoiding Improper Sympify

**Problem**: 
Pretty printing `MatAdd` involving certain `MatrixSymbol` expressions leads to a `SympifyError`. The current implementation tries to convert these expressions using `sympify`, which handles string arguments incorrectly for these cases, especially when they include characters like `'*'`.

**Analysis**:
The core issue arises because `sympify` is not suitable for handling string arguments directly from `MatrixSymbol`. The `sympify` function is designed to parse strings as SymPy expressions, but special characters or partial formulae can cause parsing errors, leading to exceptions. Additionally, the logic for omitting the `+` sign when the first argument is negative assumes specific forms of `MatAdd` arguments, which is not reliable.

To fix this issue, we should:
1. Directly propagate the `MatrixSymbol` object rather than converting it to a string and parsing it with `sympify`.
2. Adjust the logic to ensure that the `+` sign is managed correctly by analyzing the structure of the expression.

**Proposed Changes**:
The following changes should be applied to the `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` file:

1. **Modify `pretty_print` and `pretty` functions**: Ensure that matrix symbols are handled directly rather than being passed through `sympify`.
  
2. **Adjust `_print_MatAdd` function**:
   - Remove or modify the `sympify` call for the arguments.
   - Implement a safer check on the arguments to determine if the `+` sign should be omitted.

### Detailed Changes

1. **File**: `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`

   - **Function**: `pretty_print`
     - Verify and retain direct handling of `MatrixSymbol` without using `sympify` when converting to a pretty print format.

   - **Function**: `pretty`
     - Ensure the proper handling of `MatrixSymbol` and their combinations.
  
   - **Function**: `_print_MatAdd`
     - Remove/replace the usage of `sympify` on the arguments.
     - Adjust the logic to decide on the omission of the `+` sign by directly analyzing the sign of the arguments, ensuring all elements in `args` are correctly handled, even if they include special symbols like `'*'`.

**Summary**:
By directly handling `MatrixSymbol` objects and modifying the logic for checking the signs of `MatAdd` arguments, we can avoid the improper usage of `sympify` and provide a robust solution to pretty printing these expressions without encountering parsing errors.
