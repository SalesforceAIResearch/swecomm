### Ensure Correct Argument Types in Cython Backend for autowrap

**Problem:**

When using the `cython` backend for the `autowrap` function in SymPy, if the expression (`expr`) does not depend on array arguments (`args`), the generated C function has an incorrect signature. This leads to runtime errors when attempting to call the wrapped function.

**Analysis:**

The root cause of the issue lies in the code generation process. When `autowrap` generates the C code using the `cython` backend, it fails to recognize that the array arguments should be of type `double *` if they are not used in the expression (`expr`). As a result, the generated C function incorrectly declares these arguments as `double` instead of `double *`.

### Proposed Changes:

1. **sympy/utilities/autowrap.py**:
   - Within the code generation logic that generates the function signature, ensure that array arguments are correctly identified and their types are adjusted to `double *` regardless of their presence in the expression.

#### Detailed Changes:

1. **Modify `sympy/utilities/autowrap.py` File**:
   - Locate the function responsible for generating the C function signature for the `cython` backend.
   - Ensure that all array arguments have the correct type signatures (i.e., `double *` for matrices).



The logic should be modified to properly handle the argument types as follows:

- Inside the section where the `autofunc` routine is defined, check the type of each argument.
- If an argument is of type `MatrixSymbol` or similar, ensure it is typed as a pointer (`double *`).

### Summary of File Changes:

- **sympy/utilities/autowrap.py**:
  - Adapt the function signature generator to correctly handle array arguments even when they do not appear in the expression.

By implementing these changes, the resulting autowrap-generated functions using the `cython` backend will have correct argument types and thus avoid the runtime `TypeError` mentioned in the problem statement.
