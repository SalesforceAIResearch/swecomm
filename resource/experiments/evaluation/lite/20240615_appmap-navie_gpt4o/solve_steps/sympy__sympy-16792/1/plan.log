**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

1ms [prompt] system: **The problem statement**

def binary_function(symfunc, expr, **kwargs):
    """Returns a sympy function with expr as binary implementation

    This is a convenience function that automates the steps needed to
    autowrap the SymPy expression and attaching it to a Function object
    with implemented_function().

    Parameters
    ==========

    symfunc : sympy Function
        The function to bind the callable to.
    expr : sympy Expression
        The expression used to generate the function.
    kwargs : dict
        Any kwargs accepted by autowrap.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y
    >>> from sympy.utilities.autowrap import binary_function
    >>> expr = ((x - y)**(25)).expand()
    >>> f ... (27302)

autowrap with cython backend fails when array arguments do not appear in wrapped expr
When using the cython backend for autowrap, it appears that the code is not correctly generated when the function in question has array arguments that do not appear in the final expression. A minimal counterexample is:

```python
from sympy.utilities.autowrap import autowrap
from sympy import MatrixSymbol
import numpy as np

x = MatrixSymbol('x', 2, 1)
expr = 1.0
f = autowrap(expr, args=(x,), backend='cython')

f(np.array([[1.0, 2.0]]))
```

This should of course return `1.0` but instead fails with:
```python
TypeError: only size-1 arrays can be converted to Python scalars
```

A little inspection reveals that this is because the corresponding C function is generated with an incorrec... (1921)
