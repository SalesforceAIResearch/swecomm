**Title:** Fix QuerySet `select_related().only()` crash on proxy models

**Problem:** 
When performing a `select_related()` followed by an `only()` on a queryset involving proxy models, an error occurs. Specifically, `ValueError: 'id' is not in list`. This happens when trying to select related fields on a proxy model and then narrowing down fields using the `only()` method. 

**Analysis:**
The crash happens because of how Django is handling metadata for proxy models when the query optimization methods `select_related()` and `only()` are used together. In the traceback provided, we see the breakdown leading to `query.py` where it fails at the point it references the primary key. 

In `django/db/models/sql/query.py` at around line 745, the value of `opts` is set to `cur_model._meta`. For proxy models, the `_meta` attribute does not directly reference the concrete parent model which holds the actual primary key value. Instead, this should reference the concrete model's `_meta` attribute.

Instead of working directly with the model's `_meta` attribute, the correct approach would be to use the concrete model's `_meta` attribute to ensure that all primary key references are valid.

**Proposed Changes:**
To fix this issue, we need to modify the logic in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` and ensure that when dealing with proxy models, the queries use the concrete model's metadata.

1. Edit the `django/db/models/sql/query.py` file.
2. In the section around line 745 (This is where we have `opts = cur_model._meta`), we need to update the assignment to use `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` instead.
3. This will ensure that the correct metadata including primary key fields are referenced, thus avoiding the `ValueError`.

**Detailed Description:**

1. Open the file `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.
2. Locate the line around 745 where `opts` is set:
    
3. Update the line to be:
    
4. This ensures that whenever proxy models are involved, the queryset generation logic references the correct metadata from the underlying concrete model.

By implementing this change, Django will correctly handle the use of `select_related()` followed by `only()` even when proxy models are involved, ensuring the primary key references are valid and do not cause the crash.
