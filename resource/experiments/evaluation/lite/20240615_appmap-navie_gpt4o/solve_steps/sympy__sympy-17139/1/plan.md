**Title**: Fix invalid comparison of complex `I` in `trigsimp`

**Problem**: 
When calling the `simplify` function on an expression involving `cos(x)**I`, an invalid comparison of the complex number `I` occurs in `trigsimp`, specifically within the Fu transformations.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the issue is an invalid comparison operation involving a complex number (`I`) within the Fu transformation functions. The function `trigsimp` delegates part of its work to `futrig`, which calls `_futrig` recursively, and eventually invokes `TR6` from `fu.py`. This progressions includes a function (`_TR56`) that uses `rv.exp`, which can be the imaginary unit `I`, leading to the comparison error.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`**:
   - Modify the function `futrig` to handle expressions with complex powers more cautiously.

2. **Function `futrig`** within `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`:
   - Check whether `e` contains complex powers before delegating to `_futrig`.
   - If a complex power is detected, avoid the comparison or adopt a different strategy to handle it.

3. **Function `_futrig`** within `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`:
   - Investigate the recursive calls and the eventual invocation of the Fu transformations.
   - Adapt checks and function calls to ensure complex numbers are handled safely without direct comparison.

**Detailed Proposed Changes**:

1. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py**:
   - **Function: `futrig(e, **kwargs)`**:
     - Ensure it identifies and bypasses expressions with complex powers correctly.
     - Adjust the logic to either safely process or return the input expression without invoking problematic transformations.
   - **Code Block to Insert**: Within `futrig`, before assigning `bottom_up`, insert checks for complex powers and avoid/adjust recursive processing accordingly.

2. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py**:
    - **Function: `_futrig(e, **kwargs)`**:
      - Within the transformation application, add safeguards to skip or properly handle complex powers.
      - Example modification:
        - Before applying transformations like `TR6`, inspect whether `e` contains complex powers and, if so, modify or skip the transformation process to avoid invalid comparisons.
      - **Code Block to Insert**: Within `_futrig`, add conditions to detect and appropriately handle `I` or other complex entities to ensure safe processing.

By applying these changes, the function should be able to handle expressions involving `cos(x)**I` without encountering invalid comparison errors. This would resolve the reported issue and improve the robustness of `trigsimp` and its related functions.
