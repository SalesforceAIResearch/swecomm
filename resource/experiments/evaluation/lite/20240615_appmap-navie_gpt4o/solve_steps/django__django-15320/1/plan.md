**Title**: Set `subquery` attribute to True in Subquery constructor

**Problem**: The `Subquery.as_sql()` method generates invalid SQL, missing the first and last characters of the SQL string. This issue arises because the `subquery` attribute of the `Subquery.query` object is not set to `True`. Manually setting `q.query.subquery = True` resolves the issue, indicating that the `subquery` attribute should be enabled during the initialization of the `Subquery` object.

**Analysis**: 

The root cause of the invalidly generated SQL is due to the `subquery` attribute not being set to `True` within the `Subquery`'s constructor. This attribute marks the query as a subquery and ensures that the appropriate SQL syntax is applied. By default, the `subquery` attribute is `False`, which leads to the exclusion of essential characters during SQL string construction. Consequently, the SQL string output by `Subquery.as_sql()` is malformed.

The most logical approach to resolve this is to update the `Subquery`'s initialization method to set the `subquery` attribute to `True`. This will ensure that any `Subquery` instance created will correctly produce a subquery with valid SQL syntax.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File `django/db/models/expressions.py`**:
   
   - Modify the `Subquery` class's constructor (`__init__` method) to include:
       

   - Detailed Changes:
     - Locate the `Subquery.__init__` method.
     - After calling the superclass (`super().__init__`), add the line `self.query.subquery = True`.

**Changes Description**:

- **`Subquery.__init__`**:
  - **Current Code**:
    
  - **Updated Code**:
    

This change ensures that the `subquery` attribute is set to `True` by default, preventing the malformed SQL issue and rendering valid SQL for subqueries. 

By making this adjustment, the manually setting step (`q.query.subquery = True`) becomes unnecessary, ensuring a smoother development experience and preventing potential runtime errors.
