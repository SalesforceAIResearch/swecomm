**Title**: Extend trigsimp to Simplify Exponential Expressions to Trigonometric Identities

**Problem**: The `trigsimp` function currently does not simplify exponential expressions involving the imaginary unit `I` to their trigonometric equivalents. For example, it does not simplify `1/2*(-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` to `sin(k)`, or `1/2/k*(-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` to `sinc(k)`.

**Analysis**:
The core issue lies in the fact that the `trigsimp` function does not handle the simplification of exponential expressions into trigonometric functions. The relationship between exponential functions and trigonometric functions can be established using Euler's formulas:
- `exp(I*k) = cos(k) + I*sin(k)`
- `exp(-I*k) = cos(k) - I*sin(k)`

Given these relationships, we can convert an expression like `1/2*(-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` to its trigonometric form `sin(k)` by combining the results of the exponential components. Specifically:
- `1/2 * (-I * (cos(k) + I * sin(k)) + I * (cos(k) - I * sin(k))) = 1/2 * (-Icos(k) - sin(k) + Icos(k) - sin(k)) = sin(k)`

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`**:
   - Extend the `trigsimp` function to recognize and simplify exponential expressions involving the imaginary unit `I` to their trigonometric equivalents. This involves adding a process to convert `exp(I*k)` and `exp(-I*k)` to `cos(k) + I*sin(k)` and `cos(k) - I*sin(k)` respectively.

2. **Function: `trigsimp(expr, **opts)`**:
   - Add logic within this function to identify when an expression fits the format where `exp(I*k)` and `exp(-I*k)` can be converted to `sin(k)` or `cos(k)`.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Within the main `trigsimp` function, traverse the input expression (`expr`) to identify parts that involve exponential terms with the imaginary unit.
   - For such terms, apply a transformation based on Euler's formula to convert these exponential forms into their corresponding trigonometric forms.
   - Post transformation, re-evaluate the expression to see if it simplifies further using existing trigonometric identities.

4. **Example Modification in `trigsimp` function**:
    - Modify the main `trigsimp` logic, in the scripting section where other specific patterns are identified, to include new conditionals and transformations for exponential terms.

5. **File: `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`**:
   - Modify the internal helper functions, if necessary, to support this new transformation. Ensure recursive and deep simplifications make use of this extended functionality appropriately.

By implementing these changes, the `trigsimp` function should be able to handle the provided examples effectively:
