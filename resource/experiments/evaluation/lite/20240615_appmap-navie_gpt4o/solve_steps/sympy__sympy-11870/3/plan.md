**Title**: Update `trigsimp` to Simplify Exponential Functions to Trigonometric Identities

**Problem**
The `trigsimp` function currently does not simplify certain exponential expressions involving imaginary units (`I`) into their equivalent trigonometric identities. Specifically:
1. `f = 1/2 * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` should simplify to `sin(k)`.
2. `f = 1/2/k * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` should simplify to `sinc(k)`.

**Analysis**
The `trigsimp` function is designed to simplify expressions using trigonometric identities but does not directly handle transformations involving exponential functions with imaginary units to trigonometric forms.

The identities we need to incorporate are:
- `sin(x) = (exp(i*x) - exp(-i*x)) / (2i)`
- `sinc(x) = sin(x) / x`

To achieve this, `trigsimp` should be updated to recognize patterns in the form of `exp(i*k)` and `exp(-i*k)` and convert them to their corresponding trigonometric functions where applicable. This requires extending the existing pattern matching or rewriting logic to include these new transformations.

**Proposed Changes**
The most relevant file for modifying the behavior of `trigsimp` is `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py`. Hereâ€™s what should be done:

1. **Expand `_trigsimp` and `_trigpats` Functions**:
   - Add pattern matching for exponential forms involving imaginary units and their corresponding trigonometric identities.

2. **Enhance `__trigsimp` Recursive Helper**:
   - Include logic to detect and transform exponential expressions with imaginary units to trigonometric identities during the recursive traversal. 

Here are the detailed changes:

- **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py**:
  - **Modify `_trigsimp` function** to handle cases where exponential expressions with imaginary units can be simplified to trigonometric functions:
    - Introduce new matchers for `exp(I*k)` and `exp(-I*k)`.
    - Add logic to transform these matched patterns to trigonometric identities using the known relationships.
  - **Update `__trigsimp` function** to incorporate these new transformations:
    - Add pattern recognition to convert expressions like `1/2 * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` to `sin(k)` and `1/2/k * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` to `sinc(k)`.
  
Implementing these changes will extend the capability of `trigsimp` to handle the specified cases, ensuring the desired simplifications are achieved.
