simplifying exponential -> trig identities
```
f = 1 / 2 * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))
trigsimp(f)
```

Ideally, this would yield `sin(k)`. Is there a way to do this?

As a corollary, it would be awesome if 

```
f = 1 / 2 / k* (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))
trigsimp(f)
```

could yield `sinc(k)`. Thank you for your consideration!
