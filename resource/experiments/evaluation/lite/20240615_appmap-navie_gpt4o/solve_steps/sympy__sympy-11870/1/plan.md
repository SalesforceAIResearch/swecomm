**Title: Enhance `trigsimp` to Simplify Exponential Expressions to Trigonometric Identities**

**Problem:**
The current implementation of the `trigsimp` function does not simplify exponential expressions involving imaginary numbers into their trigonometric equivalents. For example, it does not convert expressions like `1 / 2 * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` into `sin(k)`, nor does it convert `1 / 2 / k * (-I*exp(I*k) + I*exp(-I*k))` into `sinc(k)`.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of this issue is that the `trigsimp` function, in its current form, lacks the logic to identify and convert expressions involving exponentials of imaginary numbers into their equivalent trigonometric identities. The function needs to recognize patterns like `exp(I*k)` and `exp(-I*k)` and use known identities to convert them into corresponding trigonometric functions.

For instance:
\[ \frac{-i \cdot e^{ik} + i \cdot e^{-ik}}{2} = \sin(k) \]
\[ \frac{-i \cdot e^{ik} + i \cdot e^{-ik}}{2k} = \frac{\sin(k)}{k} = \text{sinc}(k) \]

**Proposed Changes:**
To address this, we need to enhance the `_trigsimp` function in the `sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py` file to identify and simplify such exponential expressions.

1. **sympy/simplify/trigsimp.py: Extend `_trigsimp` to Simplify Exponentials to Trig Functions**
   - Modify the `_trigsimp` function to include additional logic that can recognize and convert exponential expressions with imaginary components to their trigonometric equivalents.
   - Add patterns to the `_trigpats` function to match expressions like `exp(I*k)` and `exp(-I*k)` and map them to `sin(k)` and `cos(k)` identities.
   - Integrate this logic within the main `trigsimp` workflow so that such conversions are attempted during the simplification process.

Detailed steps:
- In the `_trigsimp` function, add a new conditional block to check if the expression contains `exp(I*k)` and `exp(-I*k)`.
- Use symbolic manipulation to convert the expression into trigonometric forms based on known identities.
- Insert these transformations at appropriate locations in the `_trigsimp` helper function to ensure that all instances of such expressions are evaluated.

This approach ensures that the `trigsimp` function gains the capability to identify and simplify exponential expressions involving imaginary numbers into their trigonometric equivalents without altering other downstream logic or adding unnecessary complexity.

Once these changes are made, verify the enhancement by running the new expressions through `trigsimp` and checking if they are correctly simplified to `sin(k)` and `sinc(k)`.

By following this plan, you should be able to achieve the desired behavior in `trigsimp` and enhance its capability to simplify complex exponential expressions involving imaginary numbers into their trigonometric identities.
