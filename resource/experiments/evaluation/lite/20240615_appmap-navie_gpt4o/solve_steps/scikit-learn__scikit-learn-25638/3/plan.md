**Title**: Support Nullable Pandas Dtypes in `unique_labels`

**Problem**: The function `unique_labels` in `sklearn` does not currently handle nullable pandas dtypes ("Int64", "Float64", "boolean"). When these dtypes are passed, they get converted to `object` dtype when transformed to numpy arrays, leading to a `ValueError` stating "Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}".

**Analysis**: The current implementation of `unique_labels` in `sklearn`'s `utils/multiclass.py` file does not account for nullable pandas dtypes. The nullable pandas dtypes are relatively new and designed to handle missing values elegantly. They become `object` dtype when converted to numpy arrays, which in turn is misinterpreted by the current `unique_labels` function, causing it to raise a `ValueError`.

**Proposed Changes**: To handle nullable pandas dtypes properly within the `unique_labels` function:

1. Detect if any of the inputs are nullable pandas dtypes.
2. Convert them to their corresponding standard numpy dtypes explicitly before proceeding with the current logic of `unique_labels`.

This should be done efficiently to ensure it does not impact performance for standard use-cases.

### Specific Steps

1. **Modify `unique_labels` Function**: 
   - Update the function to check for nullable pandas dtypes.
   - Convert nullable pandas dtypes to their standard numpy counterparts before performing further checks.

2. **Proposed Changes in `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py`**:
   
   - **Function to Modify**: `unique_labels`
   - **Logic Change**:
     - Import pandas within the function scope to minimize overhead if pandas is not installed (as importing at the module level could be more costly).
     - Add checks for nullable pandas dtypes.
     - Convert nullable pandas dtypes to corresponding numpy dtypes to ensure uniform processing.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
- **File**: `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py`
  - **Location**: Function `unique_labels` and any helper function it might need for conversion.
  - **Changes**:
    - Import pandas within the function.
    - Before determining the `ys_types`, check if any of the elements are pandas series with nullable dtypes and convert them accordingly.
    - Proceed with the existing logic.

**Additional Consideration**:
- Ensure that the introduction of pandas import and new checks do not degrade performance significantly for users who do not use nullable pandas dtypes.
  
By making these changes, the `unique_labels` function will support nullable pandas dtypes, providing the expected behavior and avoiding unnecessary errors. This will enhance the robustness of the `unique_labels` utility function, enabling it to handle modern pandas dtypes effectively.
