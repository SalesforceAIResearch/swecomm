    # Check that we don't mix label format

    We don't allow:
        - mix of multilabel and multiclass (single label) targets
        - mix of label indicator matrix and anything else,
          because there are no explicit labels)
        - mix of label indicator matrices of different sizes
        - mix of string and integer labels

    At the moment, we also don't allow "multiclass-multioutput" input type.
