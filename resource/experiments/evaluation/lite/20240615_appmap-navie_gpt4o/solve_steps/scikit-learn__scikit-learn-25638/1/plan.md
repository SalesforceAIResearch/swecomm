**Title**: Update `unique_labels` to Support Nullable Pandas Dtypes

**Problem**:
The `unique_labels` function in sklearn raises a `ValueError` when passed nullable pandas dtypes such as "Int64", "Float64", and "boolean". The function should handle these dtypes similarly to numpy dtypes like `int64`, `float64`, and `bool`.

**Analysis**:
Nullable dtypes in pandas are useful as they allow for missing values. These dtypes, however, become `object` dtype when converted into numpy arrays, causing inconsistency in dtype handling within `unique_labels` which expects consistent, non-object dtype arrays. This discrepancy leads to the observed `ValueError`.

To resolve this:
1. Detect and convert nullable pandas dtypes to their non-nullable numpy equivalents within `unique_labels`.
2. Ensure that this conversion maintains the dtype integrity before processing.

**Proposed Changes**:
Update the `unique_labels` function in the `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py` file. The logic will involve:
1. Checking for pandas nullable dtypes.
2. Converting these dtypes to their corresponding numpy equivalents (`int64`, `float64`, `bool`) before processing.

### File: `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py`

*Function*: `unique_labels`

1. Add an import statement for pandas at the top of the file.
   

2. Update the `unique_labels` function to include the dtype conversion:
   - Check for pandas nullable dtypes using `pd.api.types.is_*_dtype`.
   - Convert the nullable dtype to its numpy equivalent before passing it to the existing dtype handling logic.

3. Near the start of the `unique_labels` function, insert logic for dtype conversion:
   

These changes ensure that the `unique_labels` function correctly processes pandas nullable dtypes, providing consistent behavior across different dtypes including support for nullable ones.

To ensure thorough integration, once the changes are complete, run the existing tests and, if needed, add specific tests to cover the newly supported nullable dtypes.
