**Title**: Support nullable pandas dtypes in `unique_labels`

**Problem**: 
Nullable pandas dtypes such as "Int64", "Float64", and "boolean" are not currently supported in sklearn's `unique_labels` function. When these dtypes are converted to numpy arrays, they become `object` dtype, which leads to a `ValueError` due to mixed data types. This behavior is inconsistent with the handling of native numpy dtypes like `int64`, `float64`, and `bool`.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of the error is that when nullable pandas dtypes are converted to numpy arrays, the resulting dtype is `object`. The `unique_labels` function currently does not correctly identify or handle the nullable pandas dtypes. The function needs to be updated to recognize these nullable dtypes and treat them similarly to their non-nullable counterparts.

**Proposed Changes**: 
One file will be changed: `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py`.

1. **Update the `unique_labels` function**:
    - Modify the logic to handle nullable pandas dtypes "Int64", "Float64", and "boolean".
    - Ensure that these dtypes do not cause a `ValueError` due to mixed data types.
    - Map the nullable pandas dtypes to their corresponding numpy dtypes before checking for type consistency.

**Detailed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sklearn/utils/multiclass.py`
   - In the `unique_labels` function, before the existing type checking logic, add checks to identify nullable pandas dtypes.
   - Adjust the dtype identification by converting them to their non-nullable numpy equivalents. You can use `pandas`â€™s `.to_numpy()` method with appropriate dtype arguments to achieve this mapping.
   - Ensure that the logic for consistency checking correctly interprets the dtype after conversion.

By implementing these changes, the `unique_labels` function should support nullable pandas dtypes in the same way it currently supports numpy dtypes, avoiding the `ValueError` and ensuring consistent behavior across dtype varieties. This will enhance the usability of `unique_labels` and save developers the step of manually converting data before using the function.
