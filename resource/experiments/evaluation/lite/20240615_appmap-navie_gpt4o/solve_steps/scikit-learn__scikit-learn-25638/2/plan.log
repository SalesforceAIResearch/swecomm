**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Support nullable pandas dtypes in `unique_labels`
### Describe the workflow you want to enable

I would like to be able to pass the nullable pandas dtypes ("Int64", "Float64", "boolean") into sklearn's `unique_labels` function. Because the dtypes become `object` dtype when converted to numpy arrays we get `ValueError: Mix type of y not allowed, got types {'binary', 'unknown'}`:

Repro with sklearn 1.2.1
```py 
    import pandas as pd
    import pytest
    from sklearn.utils.multiclass import unique_labels
    
    for dtype in ["Int64", "Float64", "boolean"]:
        y_true = pd.Series([1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1], dtype=dtype)
        y_predicted = pd.Series([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1], dtype="int64")
