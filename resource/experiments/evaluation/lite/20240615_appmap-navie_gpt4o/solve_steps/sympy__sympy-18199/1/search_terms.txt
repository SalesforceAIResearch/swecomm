<issue>
nthroot_mod function misses one root of x = 0 mod p.
When in the equation x**n = a mod p , when a % p == 0. Then x = 0 mod p is also a root of this equation. But right now `nthroot_mod` does not check for this condition. `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5 , 17)` has a root `0 mod 17`. But it does not return it.
