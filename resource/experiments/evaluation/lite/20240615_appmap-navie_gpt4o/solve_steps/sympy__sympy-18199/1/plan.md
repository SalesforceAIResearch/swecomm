**Title**: Handle root x = 0 mod p in `nthroot_mod` function

**Problem**: 
The `nthroot_mod` function is currently missing the root x = 0 mod p when calculating the solutions to x**n = a mod p, especially when a % p == 0. This results in the function failing to return 0 as a valid root. For instance, `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)` should return 0 as one of its roots but it does not.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is that the `nthroot_mod` function does not explicitly check and include x = 0 as a potential solution when a % p == 0. The function directly uses helper methods and complex calculations to determine roots without accounting for the special case where zero is a trivial root. 

To resolve this issue, we need to:
1. Add a condition to check if a % p == 0.
2. If true, include 0 as a potential root in the returned results.
3. This should be integrated in a manner consistent with how the function currently handles and returns roots, including handling the `all_roots` parameter correctly.

**Proposed Changes**:
In the `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py` file, make the following modifications within the `nthroot_mod` function:

1. **Initialization Check**: Add a condition to check if `a % p == 0` at the beginning of the function before invoking any helper method.
2. **Include 0 as Root**: If the condition is true, initialize the result set with 0. If `all_roots` is True, include 0 in the list of roots.
3. **Return with 0**: Ensure the function appropriately handles the inclusion of 0 in the result set when both `all_roots` is True and False.

Here is the detailed description of the necessary changes:

- **File**: `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py`
  - **Function**: `nthroot_mod`
    - **Logic Modifications**:
      - After importing necessary libraries and converting inputs to integers, introduce a condition to check if `a % p == 0`.
      - If `a % p == 0` and `all_roots` is False, return 0 immediately as the smallest root.
      - If `a % p == 0` and `all_roots` is True, initialize the set of roots with `[0]`.
      - Ensure that any further roots computed by the existing logic are combined with this set appropriately, and that the final return follows the behavior dictated by the `all_roots` parameter.

These changes ensure that the edge case where a % p == 0 is handled, providing complete and accurate results.

By making these changes, the `nthroot_mod` function will now correctly include 0 as a root when `a % p == 0`, satisfying the problem statement's requirements.
