**Title:** Update `nthroot_mod` to Include Root When `a % p == 0`

**Problem:**
In the `nthroot_mod` function, the case where \( a \% p == 0 \) (i.e., \( a \) is divisible by \( p \)) is not handled. Specifically, for the equation \( x^n = a \mod p \), if \( a \% p == 0 \), then one of the roots should be \( x = 0 \mod p \). This root is currently missing from the results. For example, `nthroot_mod(17*17, 5, 17)` should return `0` as one of the roots, but it does not.

**Analysis:**
The function `nthroot_mod` requires a modification to handle the special case where \( a \% p == 0 \). If \( a \% p == 0 \), then \( x = 0 \mod p \) is a root. The logic flow should be updated to check for this condition and appropriately handle it.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File to be Changed:**
   - `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py`

2. **Function to be Updated:**
   - `nthroot_mod`

3. **Detailed Description of Changes:**

   - **Step 1:** Add a check at the beginning of the `nthroot_mod` function to see if \( a \% p == 0 \). If it is true:
     - Return `0` as the root if `all_roots` is `False`.
     - Include `0` in the list of roots if `all_roots` is `True`.
   
   - **Step 2:** Ensure this new check is placed before other conditions to avoid unnecessary computations if \( a \% p == 0 \).

**Suggested Modifications in `nthroot_mod` Function in `sympy/ntheory/residue_ntheory.py`:**

- **Modification Point:**
  - Insert a new condition to check if \( a \% p == 0 \) right after the initial conversion of parameters to integers.



- **Ensuring the Correct Return Type:**
  - If `all_roots` is `False`, directly return `0`.
  - If `all_roots` is `True`, make sure `0` is included in the list of roots.

**Example Integration:**
  


**Summary:**
By adding an initial check for \( a \% p == 0 \) in the `nthroot_mod` function, we can ensure that \( x = 0 \mod p \) is included as a root when applicable. This update ensures completeness in finding all roots of the equation \( x^n = a \mod p \).
