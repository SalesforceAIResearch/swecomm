**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

[Bug]: Constrained layout UserWarning even when False
### Bug summary

When using layout settings such as `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight`, a UserWarning is produced due to incompatibility with constrained_layout, even if constrained_layout = False. This was not the case in previous versions.

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
a = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)
b = np.sin(a)
c = np.cos(a)
fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,2),constrained_layout=False)
ax[0].plot(a,b)
ax[1].plot(a,c)
plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)
```


### Actual outcome

The plot works fine but the warning is generated
