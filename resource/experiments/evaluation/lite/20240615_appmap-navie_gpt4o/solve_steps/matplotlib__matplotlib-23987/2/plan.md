**Title**: Update logic to suppress ConstrainedLayout UserWarning when `constrained_layout=False`

**Problem**: 

A UserWarning is generated when `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight'` is used, despite setting `constrained_layout=False`. This warning is incorrect and misleading as `constrained_layout` is explicitly disabled.

**Analysis**:

The root cause of the issue lies in the layout engine's compatibility checks. The warning appears even though `constrained_layout=False` because the layout engine still performs checks on compatibility with `subplots_adjust` and `tight_layout`. This issue likely stemmed from how the logic that handles layout engines wasn't updated to fully account for the `constrained_layout=False` condition.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the part of the codebase that handles layout engines and warning generation when using `subplots_adjust` and `tight_layout`. Specifically, the logic should include checks to ensure that no warnings are produced when `constrained_layout=False`.

**Proposed Changes**: 

Update the logic in the file responsible for layout management, likely within a file handling `figure`, `subplots_adjust`, or layout engines. Here is the plan:

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` (or the corresponding file that handles layout logic)
2. **Function**: The main function responsible for layout checks and generating warnings.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. Locate the logic that handles checking for layout engine compatibility (likely within functions handling `figure`, `subplots_adjust`, or related properties).
2. Introduce a conditional check to verify if `constrained_layout` is explicitly set to `False`. If it is, suppress the UserWarning.
3. Ensure that the check is correctly placed within the flow so as to not suppress warnings in other scenarios.

The result should ensure that no warning is produced when `constrained_layout=False` is set explicitly, thus making it compatible with `subplots_adjust` and `tight_layout`.

These changes should address the issue without affecting other functionalities within the Matplotlib library.
