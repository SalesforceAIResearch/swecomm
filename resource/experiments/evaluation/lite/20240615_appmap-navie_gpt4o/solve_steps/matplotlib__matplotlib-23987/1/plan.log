**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

DO choose the one most relevant file to modify.
DO NOT modify any other files.

==================
Tight Layout guide
==================

How to use tight-layout to fit plots within your figure cleanly.

*tight_layout* automatically adjusts subplot params so that the
subplot(s) fits in to the figure area. This is an experimental
feature and may not work for some cases. It only checks the extents
of ticklabels, axis labels, and titles.

An alternative to *tight_layout* is :doc:`constrained_layout
</tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide>`.


Simple Example
==============

In matplotlib, the location of axes (including subplots) are specified in
normalized figure coordinates. It can happen that your axis labels or
titles (or sometimes even ticklabels) go ou... (27190)

[Bug]: Constrained layout UserWarning even when False
### Bug summary

When using layout settings such as `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight`, a UserWarning is produced due to incompatibility with constrained_layout, even if constrained_layout = False. This was not the case in previous versions.

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
a = np.linspace(0,2*np.pi,100)
b = np.sin(a)
c = np.cos(a)
fig,ax = plt.subplots(1,2,figsize=(8,2),constrained_layout=False)
ax[0].plot(a,b)
ax[1].plot(a,c)
plt.subplots_adjust(wspace=0)
```


### Actual outcome

The plot works fine but the warning is generated
