### Suppress UserWarning When Constrained Layout is Disabled and Using `plt.subplots_adjust`

**Problem:** 

When using layout settings such as `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight'`, a `UserWarning` is produced due to incompatibility with `constrained_layout`, even if `constrained_layout = False`. This issue was not present in previous versions.

**Analysis:**

The warning is raised because the code that checks for layout compatibility is executed, even when `constrained_layout` is explicitly set to `False`. When you explicitly disable the `constrained_layout`, it should not perform any compatibility checks with functions like `plt.subplots_adjust`.

**Proposed Changes:**

To resolve the issue, we need to update the logic in the library to ensure that when `constrained_layout` is set to `False`, no warnings are generated. Specifically, we should add a check to skip the layout compatibility verification if `constrained_layout` is disabled.

### Changes to Implement:

#### File: `lib/matplotlib/layout_engine.py`

1. **Suppress Compatibility Check When `constrained_layout` is `False`:**
   - Locate the method that initializes layout engines and performs the compatibility check.
   - Modify the logic to conditionally bypass the verification when `constrained_layout=False`.

#### Specific Changes:

1. **Adjust the Initialization in `ConstrainedLayoutEngine.__init__`:**

   

2. **Modify the `execute` Method to Check for `constrained_layout=False`:**

   
   
By ensuring the `execute` method skips the layout adjustments and compatibility check when `constrained_layout` is set to `False`, we can eliminate the unwanted warning.

### Conclusion:

The proposed changes involve modifying the logic in the `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` class to respect the `constrained_layout=False` setting and bypass the warning trigger. This change will ensure that the warning is not displayed in scenarios where `constrained_layout` is explicitly disabled, aligning with the expected behavior and previous versions' functionality.
