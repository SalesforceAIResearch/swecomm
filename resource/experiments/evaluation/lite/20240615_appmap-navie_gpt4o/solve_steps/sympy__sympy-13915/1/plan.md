**Title**: Fix substitution issue in complex rational expressions to handle undefined expressions

**Problem**:
When performing a substitution where the substituted variable results in an undefined expression within a complex rational expression, the substitution does not correctly account for the undefined state. Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` should result in an undefined expression. Instead, the current implementation provides an incorrect result (`1`), when it should either handle the undefined state or calculate the limit correctly.

**Analysis**:
The core of the issue lies in how SymPy handles substitutions in expressions. When substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, the denominator becomes zero, which should lead to an undefined expression. The current approach does not check for such cases and proceeds with the substitution, yielding an incorrect result.

To address this, we need to modify the substitution logic to:
1. Check for undefined expressions resulting from substitutions.
2. Handle these cases appropriately by either raising an error or computing the limit where possible.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/core/basic.py`
   - Modify the `_eval_subs` method to include a check for undefined expressions resulting from substitutions.
   - If an undefined state is detected, raise an appropriate error or compute the limit.

### Detailed Description of Changes:

1. **sympy/core/basic.py - Modify `_eval_subs` method**:
   - **Check for Undefined Expressions**: Add logic to determine if the substitution causes any part of the expression to become undefined.
   - **Handle Undefined State**: Depending on user preference or a predefined policy, either raise an error indicating that the expression is undefined or compute the limit if feasible.

### Steps:
1. **Check for Undefined Expressions**:
   - Inspect the expression after substitution to see if any denominator becomes zero or any similar undefined math operation occurs.
2. **Handle Undefined State**:
   - If the policy is to compute the limit, use SymPy's `limit` functionality to compute the limit of the expression as the variable approaches the substitution value.
   - Otherwise, raise an error indicating the undefined state of the resulting expression.

### Example Implementation Steps:
1. In the `_eval_subs` method, perform the substitution.
2. Check each sub-expression in the resulting expression for undefined conditions (e.g., denominators becoming zero).
3. If an undefined condition is detected, either:
   - Raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating the undefined state.
   - Compute the limit using `expr.limit(variable, substitution_value)` and return the result if the limit exists and is valid.

By applying these changes, the substitution will correctly handle cases where the expression becomes undefined, thus preventing incorrect results from being returned.
