In [1]: from sympy import *

In [2]: a,b = symbols('a,b')

In [3]: r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))

In [4]: r.subs(b,a)
Out[4]: 1

In [6]: import sympy

In [7]: sympy.__version__
Out[7]: '1.1.1'
```

If b is substituted by a, r is undefined. It is possible to calculate the limit
`r.limit(b,a) # -1`

But whenever a subexpression of r is undefined, r itself is undefined.
