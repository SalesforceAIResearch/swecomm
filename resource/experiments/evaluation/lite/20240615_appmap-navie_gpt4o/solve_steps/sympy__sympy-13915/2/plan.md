**Title:** Fix substitution leading to undefined expression in substitution logic

**Problem:**
Substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` using SymPy results in an incorrect value `1` instead of being undefined. The proper mathematical behavior would be to recognize the undefined nature of the expression or to handle it symbolically such as by using limits.

**Analysis:**
The issue arises when substitution in SymPy does not account for instances where the resulting expression is undefined. The core problem is that SymPy performs a direct substitution without checking the domain constraints that may render parts of the expressions invalid, like a division by zero. Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` results in divisions of zero in this case.

To conform with correct mathematical expectations, SymPy needs additional handling to either:
1. Detect these invalid substitutions and raise an appropriate error.
2. Automatically simplify the resulting form using mathematically appropriate approaches like limits.

Current behavior in SymPy shows that it does not handle this scenario directly, leading to a misleading result.

**Proposed Changes:**
The most relevant file for modification is likely to be `sympy/core/basic.py`, where the core substitution mechanic is implemented. The changes should ensure that:
1. Substitution should check if resultant expressions have undefined behavior.
2. Enhance substitution logic to handle scenarios by either raising an error or simplifying using limits.

### Steps to Modify in `sympy/core/basic.py`:

1. **Modify the `subs` method** to include a pre-check for undefined conditions:
   - Capture the result of the substitution.
   - Analyze resulting expressions for cases that might involve divisions by zero or other undefined conditions.

2. **Update post-processing logic** for substitutions:
   - Implement logic to automatically detect and handle undefined results from substitutions. If the result is found to be undefined in any part of the expression, raise an error or provide a symbolic handling like applying `limit`.

3. **Implement error handling or limit applications**:
   - Where a substitution results in undefined expressions, encapsulate operations within a try/except block and handle the exceptions gracefully, possibly suggesting or applying `limit` functions.

**Detailed Change Description**:

- At the appropriate location in `subs` method:
  - Before completing a substitution, attempt to simplify the expression.
  - Check for resulting undefined terms like division by zero.
    
- Where domain-specific issues (e.g., division by zero) are detected:
  - Raise `ValueError` indicating the undefined nature.
  - If an automatic simplification using limits is appropriate, proceed with it.

This change should ensure correct, mathematically consistent behavior of `subs` function in SymPy and prevent misleading results.

The specific steps within `sympy/core/basic.py` might look something like this:
- Add helper function to check undefined expressions.
- Extend the `subs` method to utilize this helper function pre-post substitution.

By focusing changes on `sympy/core/basic.py`, maintaining minimal changes, we ensure the integrity of substitution logic while enhancing its robustness to handle edge cases like the one described.

This approach navigates the balance of not altering the broader functionality while addressing the incorrect result due to improper handling of undefined expressions post-substitution.
