**Title**: Fix Substitution Resulting in Incorrect Value for Undefined Expression

**Problem**:
When substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r`, the expected outcome should be undefined due to the resulting zero denominator. Instead, the current implementation incorrectly provides a result of `1`. The code should return an undefined result when any subexpression within `r` evaluates to an undefined state.

**Analysis**:
When performing substitutions in symbolic expressions, if any operation within the expression leads to a mathematical undefined state, the entire expression should reflect that undefined state. Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` leads to divisions by zero, which should make the expression undefined. Currently, the substitution method doesn't fully account for divisions by zero and returns an incorrect result.

The root cause of the issue is that the substitution method does not handle undefined operations properly, instead returning a result that doesn't reflect the undefined state.

**Proposed Changes**:
To fix this issue, modifications should be made to the substitution logic in the `subs` method within the relevant sympy core code. The required changes aim to raise an appropriate exception or return an undefined state when the substitution leads to divisions by zero or any other undefined operations.

1. **File: sympy/core/basic.py**
    - Modify the `subs` method handling to check for undefined states after substitution.
    - Include a check for zero denominators or other undefined operations within the substituted expression.
    - Modify the handling to either:
        - Return `S.NaN` or an equivalent undefined symbol.
        - Raise an appropriate exception indicating the operation is undefined.

Each change should focus on ensuring that the mathematical consistency of the expression is maintained when substitutions are performed.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Modification in sympy/core/basic.py**:
    - Locate and inspect the `subs` method.
    - Introduce checks to detect operations resulting in undefined states:
      - After applying the substitution, inspect the resulting expression for divisions by zero or other undefined results.
      - Implement logic to return `S.NaN` or raise an error for undefined results.

By doing these changes, the substitution process will correctly handle situations where the substitution results in undefined expressions, maintaining the mathematical accuracy and integrity expected from symbolic computation.

By making this change, sympy will correctly handle the substitution of variables in expressions that lead to undefined states, providing accurate and reliable results.
