**Title**: Fix mask propagation when one operand does not have a mask in NDDataRef arithmetic operations

**Problem**: 
In version 5.3 of Astropy, when performing arithmetic operations with `NDDataRef` instances and using `handle_mask=np.bitwise_or`, the propagation of masks fails if one operand does not have a mask. This results in a `TypeError` because the bitwise OR operation is attempted between an integer and `NoneType`.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises in the `_arithmetic_mask` method of the `NDArithmeticMixin`. This method is responsible for determining the resulting mask when two `NDDataRef` instances are involved in an arithmetic operation. The method correctly identifies scenarios when one operand does not have a mask, but fails to handle the conversion and propagation properly when invoking `handle_mask`, especially with operations like `np.bitwise_or`.

To resolve this, we need to ensure that the method appropriately handles cases where one of the operands does not have a mask by propagating the existing mask from the non-null mask operand. Specifically, we should verify that we return only the non-null mask when one of the operands lacks a mask. 

**Proposed Changes**:
Modify the `_arithmetic_mask` method in `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py` to correct the propagation of masks when one operand's mask is `None`.

1. **File**: `astropy/nddata/mixins/ndarithmetic.py`
   - **Function**: `_arithmetic_mask`

   **Changes**:
   - Add a condition to handle cases where one operand has a `None` mask. If one operand's mask is `None`, the method should return a deep copy of the mask from the other operand.
   - Ensure that the `handle_mask` function is only called when both masks are not `None`.

   **Detailed Steps**:
   1. Identify where `_arithmetic_mask` evaluates the masks.
   2. Add conditional logic to check for `None` masks and handle accordingly.
   3. Ensure proper deep copying of masks to maintain immutability of original data.
   4. Adjust the invocation of `handle_mask` to prevent operations between a mask and `NoneType`.

By implementing these changes, the method will correctly handle scenarios where one operand does not have a mask, thus resolving the `TypeError` and ensuring consistent mask propagation as expected.

**Example of Adjusted Logic in `_arithmetic_mask`**:
- Add checks like:
  

This approach ensures that the mask from the operand that has a mask gets propagated to the result when the other operand lacks a mask. Thus, maintaining the expected behavior and compatibility with previous versions like v5.2.
