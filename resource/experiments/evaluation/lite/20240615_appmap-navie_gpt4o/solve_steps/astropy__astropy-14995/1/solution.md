Let's address the issue described in the `_arithmetic_mask` method of the `NDArithmeticMixin` class, ensuring that mask propagation works correctly when one operand does not have a mask. We will make modifications as proposed: 

1. Add a condition to handle cases where one operand has a `None` mask. If one operand's mask is `None`, return a deep copy of the mask from the other operand.
2. Ensure `handle_mask` function is only called when both masks are not `None`.

Here's the modification to the `_arithmetic_mask` method:

        This is implemented as the piecewise ``or`` operation if both have a

            self.

            If only one mask was present this mask is returned.
            If neither had a mask ``None`` is returned. Otherwise
            ``handle_mask`` must create (and copy) the returned mask.

```

With these changes, the `_arithmetic_mask` method will correctly handle cases where one operand does not have a mask, ensuring that the existing mask from the non-null mask operand is propagated. This will prevent the `TypeError` arising from trying to perform a bitwise OR operation with a `NoneType`.
