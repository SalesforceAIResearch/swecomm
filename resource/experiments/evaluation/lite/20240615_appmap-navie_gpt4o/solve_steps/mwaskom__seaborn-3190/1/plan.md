**Title**: Fix color mapping for boolean data in ContinuousBase scale

**Problem**: 
Color mapping for boolean data is resulting in a `TypeError` during the normalization step in the `ContinuousBase` scale. The error message suggests using bitwise or logical XOR operations instead of the `-` operator, as numpy does not support subtraction for boolean types.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises when the `_setup` method of the `ContinuousBase` scale attempts to normalize boolean data. Specifically, the subtraction operation (`forward(vmax) - forward(vmin)`) fails because boolean values do not support the `-` operator. This operation is intended to calculate a normalization factor for continuous data, which is not applicable to boolean data.

**Proposed Changes**: 
1. **seaborn/_core/scales.py**:
   - Modify the `_setup` method in the `ContinuousBase` class to include a check for boolean data types and handle normalization appropriately.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **seaborn/_core/scales.py** - Update `_setup` method in the `ContinuousBase` class:
    - Before performing the subtraction operation for normalization, check if the data type is boolean.
    - If the data type is boolean, directly map the values to 0 and 1 without performing subtraction.

#### Changes:
1. **seaborn/_core/scales.py**:
    - Locate the `_setup` method in the `ContinuousBase` class.
    - Introduce a type check for the data to handle boolean data separately.

#### Example Implementation Description:
- Inside the `_setup` method of `ContinuousBase`, before the normalization step:
  - Check if `data` or `vmin` and `vmax` are of boolean type:
    - If they are boolean:
      
    - This ensures that boolean data is mapped correctly without attempting an unsupported operation.

By making these changes, boolean data will be correctly mapped to a color scale without causing TypeErrors, ensuring compatibility and proper functionality within the seaborn plots.
