**Title**: Correct matrix element fetched from BlockMatrix

**Problem**:
When retrieving an element from a `BlockMatrix`, the returned element may be incorrectly simplified. Specifically, for a given block matrix, if the index points to an element in a submatrix other than the first one, the current implementation may still incorrectly simplify it as if it belongs to the first matrix. This can lead to incorrect results, as shown in the example provided where `C[i, 0]` is wrongly identified as `A[i, 0]`.

**Analysis**:
The problem occurs because the current implementation of element fetching in the `BlockMatrix` class does not properly account for the position of the element across the blocks. The logic needs to first determine in which block the indexed element lies and then fetch the relevant element from that specific block. This requires adjusting the indices appropriately based on the dimensions of the preceding blocks.

To fix this issue:
1. Modify the `__getitem__` method of the `BlockMatrix` class to correctly compute the index offsets based on the dimensions of each block.
2. Ensure that the fetched element is wrapped in a way that correctly reflects its origin.

**Proposed Changes**:
The following modifications should be made in the `sympy/printing/rust.py` file. These changes will ensure that the correct elements are fetched from the correct submatrix in the `BlockMatrix`:

1. Locate the `__getitem__` method within the `sympy/printing/rust.py` file. If no such method exists in this file, it typically means it relies on the core `sympy` methods. However, as per the problem context, it appears we should customize or correct something in this file.

2. Amend the logic within the `__getitem__` method to properly calculate the relative positions and determine the correct block that holds the desired element.

Here's a detailed description of changes needed:

- **sympy/printing/rust.py**:
  - Look through the imports and ensure `BlockMatrix` is correctly imported.
  - In the appropriate class or method handling matrix indices (likely itâ€™s `LLVMJitPrinter` or similar in the context of matrix handling):
    - Modify the code handling `BlockMatrix` access such that it first determines which sub-matrix the indices fall into.
    - Adjust these indices relative to the origin of the identified sub-matrix.
    - Return the matrix element from the correct sub-matrix based on adjusted indices.

Implementing this will ensure that the fetched element accurately reflects whether it is from `A` or `B` and corresponds correctly to the index provided.

These steps should correct the issue of fetching wrong matrix elements from `BlockMatrix`. Please implement these changes and verify if the correct element is now being returned.
