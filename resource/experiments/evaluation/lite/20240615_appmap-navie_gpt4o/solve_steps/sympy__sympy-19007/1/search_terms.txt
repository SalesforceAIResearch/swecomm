Wrong matrix element fetched from BlockMatrix
Given this code:
```
from sympy import *
n, i = symbols('n, i', integer=True)
A = MatrixSymbol('A', 1, 1)
B = MatrixSymbol('B', n, 1)
C = BlockMatrix([[A], [B]])
print('C is')
pprint(C)
print('C[i, 0] is')
pprint(C[i, 0])
```
I get this output:
```
C is
⎡A⎤
⎢ ⎥
⎣B⎦
C[i, 0] is
(A)[i, 0]
```
`(A)[i, 0]` is the wrong here. `C[i, 0]` should not be simplified as that element may come from either `A` or `B`.
