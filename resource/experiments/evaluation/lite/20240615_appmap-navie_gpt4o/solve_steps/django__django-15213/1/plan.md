**Title**: Handle ExpressionWrapper for Negative Q objects with Empty Conditions

**Problem**:
When using an `ExpressionWrapper` with a negated `Q` object that contains an empty condition list (e.g., `~Q(pk__in=[])`), the resulting SQL query is invalid. The issue arises because the generated SQL lacks the necessary components. 

**Analysis**:
The core of the problem is the handling of SQL generation for `Q` objects with empty conditions in conjunction with negation (`~`). In SQL, an `IN` clause with an empty list is typically invalid and should be treated differently during the query construction process.

1. **For `Q(pk__in=[])`**:
   - This is translated to a condition that is always false.
   - The corresponding SQL query will be `SELECT 0 AS "foo" FROM "table"`, which is valid.

2. **For `~Q(pk__in=[])`**:
   - This should logically be a condition that is always true because negating "nothing in the list" should cover all possible rows.
   - The corresponding SQL query currently translates to something like `SELECT AS "foo" FROM "table"`, which is invalid.

3. The root cause lies in how the `ExpressionWrapper` class, or underlying query building logic, handles the construction of such negated empty conditions.

**Proposed Changes**:
The goal is to ensure that when a negated `Q` object with an empty condition list is encountered, it is correctly translated into a valid SQL fragment. Specifically:

1. **File**: `django/db/models/sql/where.py`
    
    Modify the logic that handles `Q` object negation with empty conditions. Ensure to translate `~Q(pk__in=[])` into a logical representation that results in "true".

    - Introduce checks to detect when an empty condition list is being negated.
    - Ensure the SQL translation for such cases generates a valid "always true" condition.

Relevant code areas include:

- The `add_q()` method, where `Q` objects are processed and translated into SQL.
- The `_add_q()` helper method, which recursively decomposes `Q` objects and might require adjustments to handle special cases of empty lists with negation.

By adjusting the handling of these edge cases, you can ensure that SQL generation results in valid, executable queries in all scenarios.

**Steps**:
1. **Locate the Q object handling logic** in `django/db/models/sql/where.py`.
2. **Modify the conditional checks** to identify when a `Q` object has an empty condition list.
3. Ensure that when such a condition is negated (e.g., `~Q(pk__in=[])`), it translates to an "always true" SQL expression.

By applying these changes, the generated SQL for `ExpressionWrapper(~Q(pk__in=[]), output_field=BooleanField())` should be valid and logically accurate. This will fix the current issue where negated empty conditions lead to invalid SQL statements.
