**Title**: Fix `join` template filter to respect `autoescape` directive for the joining string

**Problem**: When using the `join` filter within a Django template block with `{% autoescape off %}`, the joining string (i.e., the delimiter) is forcibly escaped, whereas the items in the list are not escaped. This is inconsistent and does not match the expected behavior where nothing should be escaped if `autoescape` is off.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue lies in the implementation of the `join` filter in Django's template engine. When the `autoescape` directive is `off`, both the items in the list and the joining string should not be escaped. However, currently, the joining string is being escaped regardless of the `autoescape` setting, leading to unexpected and inconsistent output in templates.

To fix this issue, the logic for the `join` filter needs to be modified to respect the `autoescape` context. Specifically, the filter should check the `autoescape` setting and apply escaping to the joining string accordingly.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/template/defaultfilters.py`
    - Locate the implementation of the `join` filter.
    - Modify the logic to check for the `autoescape` setting.
    - Ensure that the joining string is escaped only if `autoescape` is on.

Detailed steps:
- Identify the function that implements the `join` filter.
- Import relevant utilities to check the `autoescape` setting.
- Adjust the logic to conditionally escape the joining string based on the `autoescape` setting.

This change will involve adding a conditional check to see if `autoescape` is enabled and applying escaping to the joining string only if it is turned on. If `autoescape` is off, the joining string should be used as is without escaping.

By making these changes, the `join` filter will adhere to the `autoescape` directive, producing consistent and expected results in templates.
