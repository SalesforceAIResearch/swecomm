**Title**: Fix the `join` filter to honor `autoescape` settings for joining string

**Problem**:
The `join` filter in Django templates currently escapes the joining string even when `autoescape` is set to `off`. This behavior is unexpected and inconsistent. The `autoescape` directive is supposed to prevent automatic escaping of items in the template. However, while the items in the list being joined (`some_list`) are not escaped, the joining string (`some_var`) is forcibly escaped, which is not the expected behavior.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue is the way the `join` filter handles escaping. When the `autoescape` directive is `off`, the filter should respect this setting for both the items being joined and the joining string. Currently, the joining string is always being escaped, regardless of the `autoescape` setting, leading to test failures where the joining string is expected to be unescaped.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `join` filter to check the autoescape setting and conditionally escape the joining string based on this setting.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/template/defaultfilters.py`
   - Locate the `join` filter function.
   - Modify the function to conditionally escape the joining string based on the `autoescape` setting. The function should check if `autoescape` is off and, if so, avoid escaping the joining string.

Detailed changes:
- Add logic to check the `autoescape` setting:
  - If `autoescape` is `off`, bypass the escaping of the joining string.
  - If `autoescape` is `on`, proceed with the current behavior of escaping the joining string.

By making this change, the `join` filter will respect the `autoescape` directive for both the list items and the joining string, ensuring consistent and expected behavior. This will also result in passing the provided test cases that currently fail.

After implementing the changes, run the test cases to verify that the issue is resolved. The tests should now pass without any assertion errors, confirming that the `join` filter behavior aligns with the `autoescape` setting.
