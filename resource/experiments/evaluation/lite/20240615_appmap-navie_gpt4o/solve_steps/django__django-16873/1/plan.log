**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Template filter `join` should not escape the joining string if `autoescape` is `off`
Description
	
Consider the following template code snippet:
{% autoescape off %}
{{ some_list|join:some_var }}
{% endautoescape %}
in this case, the items inside some_list will not be escaped (matching the expected behavior) but some_var will forcibly be escaped. From the docs for autoescape or join I don't think this is expected behavior.
The following testcase illustrates what I think is a bug in the join filter (run inside the template_tests/filter_tests folder):
from django.template.defaultfilters import escape
from django.test import SimpleTestCase
from ..utils import setup
class RegressionTests(SimpleTestCase):
	@setup({"join01": '{{ some_list|join:some_var }}'})
	def test_join0... (2411)
