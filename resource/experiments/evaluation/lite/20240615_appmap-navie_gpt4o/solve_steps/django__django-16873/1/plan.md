**Title**: Modify `join` Template Filter to Respect `autoescape` Setting for Joining String

**Problem**:  
The `join` template filter in Django currently escapes the joining string even when `autoescape` is set to `off`. This behavior is not expected and contradicts the documentation and the typical use cases for template filters when `autoescape` is turned off.

**Analysis**:  
When using the `join` template filter within an `{% autoescape off %}` block, the elements of the list (`some_list`) are correctly not escaped, which aligns with the behavior of turning autoescaping off. However, the joining string (`some_var`) is still being escaped, which contradicts the expected behavior. The root cause of this bug lies in the implementation of the `join` filter where it does not consider the `autoescape` setting while processing the joining string.

**Proposed Changes**:  
We need to update the implementation of the `join` template filter to respect the `autoescape` setting. This change should ensure that if `autoescape` is set to `off`, the joining string (`some_var`) should not be escaped. The appropriate place to make this change is in the `django/template/defaultfilters.py` file where the `join` filter is defined.

1. **File**: `django/template/defaultfilters.py`
   - **Function to Modify**: `join`
   - **Change Description**: Update the `join` function to check the context for the `autoescape` setting. If `autoescape` is `off`, do not escape the joining string. If `autoescape` is `on` (the default), continue to escape the joining string.

Instructions for modifying the `join` function:
- Determine if `autoescape` is `off` by checking the context parameters.
- If `autoescape` is off, use the joining string (`some_var`) as is.
- If `autoescape` is on, escape the joining string using the `conditional_escape` method.

By making the above change, the `join` filter will correctly respect the `autoescape` setting and produce the expected output in scenarios where autoescaping is disabled. This will resolve the bug demonstrated in the provided test cases.
