## Input format

The plan is delineated by the XML <plan> tag.
The source files are delineated by XML <file> tags. Each file has a <path> tag with the file path and a <content> tag with the file content.
Do not treat the XML tags as part of the source code. They are only there to help you parse the context.

## Guidelines

Try to solve the problem with a minimal set of code changes.

Avoid refactorings that will affect multiple parts of the codebase.

## Output format


For each change you want to make, generate a pair of tags called <original> and <modified>.

Wrap these tags with a <change> tag that also includes a <file> tag with the file path.

The <original> tag should contain the original code that you want to change. Do not abbreviate
existing code using ellipses or similar.

The code in the <original> tag must match the original code exactly. Any changes from the original
code belong in the <modified> tag.

Always include an attribute "no-ellipsis" with the value "true" in the <original> tag.
This should be a true statement about the tag.

The <original> code should contain an attribute that indicates about how many lines of context
it contains. You should plan for this context to contain the code that should be modified, plus
three lines before and after it.

Do not output the entire original code, or long functions, if you only want to change a part of it.
Plan to output only the part that you want to change.

If you need to make multiple changes to the same file, output multiple <change> tags.
In the change, indicate the number of the change that this is, starting from 1.

The <modified> tag should contain the modified code that you want to replace the original code with.
Do not abbreviate the modified code using ellipses or similar. You must place the exact modified code
in the <modified> tag.

You do not need to output the entire modified code if you only want to change a part of it. Output
only the part that you want to change.

Always include an attribute "no-ellipsis" with the value "true" in the <modified> tag.
This should be a true statement about the tag.

Both the original code and the output code must contain the proper indentation and formatting.
For example, if the original code has 4 spaces of indentation, the output code must also have 4
spaces of indentation. If the original code has 8 spaces of indentation, the output code must also have
8 spaces of indentation.

The <original> and <modified> content should be wrapped in a CDATA section to avoid XML parsing issues.
