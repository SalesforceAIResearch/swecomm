With code like:

	help = '''
	Import a contract from tzkt.
	Example usage:
		./manage.py tzkt_import 'Tezos Mainnet' KT1HTDtMBRCKoNHjfWEEvXneGQpCfPAt6BRe
	'''
Help output is:
$ ./manage.py help tzkt_import
usage: manage.py tzkt_import [-h] [--api API] [--version] [-v {0,1,2,3}] [--settings SETTINGS]
							 [--pythonpath PYTHONPATH] [--traceback] [--no-color] [--force-color]
							 [--skip-checks]
							 blockchain target

KT1HTDtMBRCKoNHjfWEEvXneGQpCfPAt6BRe

 target				Id of the contract to import
When that was expected:
$ ./manage.py help tzkt_import
