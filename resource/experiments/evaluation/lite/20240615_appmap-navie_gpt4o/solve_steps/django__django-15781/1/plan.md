**Title**: Improve Django management command formatter to support multiline help texts

**Problem**: 
The help output for custom Django management commands does not properly format multiline help texts, causing the example usage and other information to be displayed in a single line. This formatting issue makes the help text less readable.

**Analysis**: 
The crux of the issue lies in how the help text is processed and outputted by Django’s management command system. The help attribute in a command class is expected to support and correctly format multiline strings, but currently, it’s being processed in a way that ignores the intended format.

Django uses a custom HelpFormatter (`DjangoHelpFormatter`) for arguments, and this formatter likely needs to be extended or modified to properly handle multiline help strings. Specifically, the logic that constructs and prints the help message needs to interpret newlines correctly.

**Proposed Changes**: 
The file containing this logic is `django/core/management/base.py`. We will focus on modifying the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class to ensure multiline help texts are handled correctly.

**Modify `DjangoHelpFormatter` in `django/core/management/base.py`**:
1. Locate the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class definition.
2. Modify the `add_usage` and `add_arguments` methods to check for newline characters in the description and help strings. Ensure that these newlines are correctly handled and preserved in the output.
3. Adjust the `_reordered_actions` method if necessary to handle multiline strings.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Locate the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class**:
    - This class is defined towards the end of the `django/core/management/base.py`.
  
2. **Modify the `add_usage` method**:
    - Ensure that usage strings preserve their newlines and whitespace formatting.
    - Check for newline characters and handle them appropriately to ensure proper alignment and readability.

3. **Modify the `add_arguments` method**:
    - Process the arguments to ensure that the help text for each argument preserves multiline formatting.
    - Ensure that the help output sections (such as "positional arguments" and "optional arguments") are properly organized and formatted.

By implementing these changes, the help output for the custom management commands will correctly display multiline descriptions, improving readability and usability for developers.

**Example Change**: 
- Method: `add_usage`
  - Ensure usage strings are split by lines and each line is appropriately formatted before concatenation.
  
- Method: `add_arguments`
  - Process each argument's help text to ensure multiline strings are handled correctly.

By following these steps, we ensure that the help output for management commands maintains the intended formatting of the help text, making it easier for developers to understand the usage of the commands.
