**Title**: Add `store_cv_values` Flag Support to `RidgeClassifierCV`

**Problem**: 
The issue claims that the `RidgeClassifierCV` class in the `sklearn.linear_model` module does not support the `store_cv_values` parameter, even though its documentation indicates that this parameter is available. Attempting to use the parameter results in a `TypeError`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem is that the `RidgeClassifierCV` class does not currently define an `__init__` method that accepts a `store_cv_values` parameter. This means the class does not store cross-validation values during the fitting process, leading to an inconsistency between its implementation and the documentation. To resolve this issue, we need to:

1. Modify the `RidgeClassifierCV` class to accept a `store_cv_values` parameter.
2. Ensure that cross-validation values are stored and can be accessed as an attribute if this parameter is set to True.
3. Update the internal logic to conditionally store the cross-validation values based on the `store_cv_values` flag.
4. Ensure that the logic is consistent with the documentation and verify the integrity of the feature by checking similar implementations such as `RidgeCV`.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sklearn/linear_model/_ridge.py`

  - **Modify the `RidgeClassifierCV` class**:
    - Update the `__init__` method to accept the `store_cv_values` parameter.
    - Initialize an instance variable for storing cross-validation values.
    
  - **Update the `fit` method**:
    - Add logic to store cross-validation values if `store_cv_values` is set to True.
    - Adapt the implementation based on similar handling done in the `RidgeCV` class.

  - **Example modifications**:
    - Add an `__init__` parameter `store_cv_values=False` by default.
    - Modify the fitting logic to conditionally capture cross-validation predictions in compliance with the flag.
  
  - Detailed modifications:
    - Locate the `RidgeClassifierCV` class definition.
    - Add the `store_cv_values` parameter to the `__init__` method signature.
    - In the `fit` method, implement logic similar to `RidgeCV` to store cross-validation values in `self.cv_values_` if `store_cv_values` is True.

By making the above changes, the `RidgeClassifierCV` class will allow users to specify the `store_cv_values` parameter, and when enabled, cross-validation values will be stored and accessible, bringing the implementation in line with the existing documentation. This resolves the documented issue and tests should be conducted to verify integration and correctness.
