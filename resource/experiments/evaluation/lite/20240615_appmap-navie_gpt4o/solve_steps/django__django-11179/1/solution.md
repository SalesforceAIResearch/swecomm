Sure, I'll help you with that. To address the issue where the primary key (PK) of models is not set to `None` after deletion, especially for models without dependencies, we'll make necessary modifications to the `delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`.

We'll ensure the PK is set to `None` after performing the fast delete operations in the `delete` method of the `Collector` class.

Here is the change plan:

1. Detect the specific case where a single object with no dependencies is being deleted.
2. After performing the delete operation, set the primary key attribute of the instance to `None`.

Here's the implementation:

```xml
<change>
    <file change-number-for-this-file="1">django/db/models/deletion.py</file>
    <original line-count="11" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
        # Optimize for the case with a single obj and no dependencies
        if len(self.data) == 1 and len(instances) == 1:
            instance = list(instances)[0]
            if self.can_fast_delete(instance):
                with transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error():
                    count = sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch([instance.pk], self.using)
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}

        with transaction.atomic(using=self.using, savepoint=False):
    ]]></original>
    <modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
        # Optimize for the case with a single obj and no dependencies
        if len(self.data) == 1 and len(instances) == 1:
            instance = list(instances)[0]
            if self.can_fast_delete(instance):
                with transaction.mark_for_rollback_on_error():
                    count = sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch([instance.pk], self.using)
                    # Set primary key to None post deletion
                    setattr(instance, instance._meta.pk.attname, None)
                return count, {model._meta.label: count}

        with transaction.atomic(using=self.using, savepoint=False):
    ]]></modified>
</change>
```

This XML plan specifies the modification from the original code to the updated code where the primary key is set to `None` after the delete operation for the fast delete cases. This aligns the instance state with the deletion.
