**Title**: Update `delete` method to clear primary keys for models without dependencies

**Problem**: When deleting instances of models that have no dependencies, the primary key (PK) is not set to `None` post deletion. The PK should be set to `None` after the `.delete()` method is called to ensure the instance reflects its deleted state properly.

**Analysis**:
To address this issue, we need to modify the delete logic. Currently, when an instance with no dependencies is deleted using the `delete` method of the `Collector` class, its primary key is not cleared (i.e., set to `None`). This can lead to inconsistencies where an instance seems to still have a valid PK even though it has been deleted from the database.

### Root Cause
Within the `delete` method in `django/db/models/deletion.py`, the line responsible for handling fast deletes does not clear the PK of the instance if there are no dependencies.

### Solution
The solution requires ensuring the PK is set to `None` after the instance is fast-deleted when there are no dependencies. This involves modifying the branch of code handling the fast delete and ensuring the PK is cleared once the instance is removed from the database.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/models/deletion.py`
   - **Location**: Modify the `delete` method of the `Collector` class.
   - **Changes**:
     - After performing the fast delete (when there is exactly one instance with no dependencies), clear the PK of the instance by setting it to `None`.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **In the `delete` method**:
   - Identify the block handling the fast delete (lines 276-281).
   - After `count = sql.DeleteQuery(model).delete_batch([instance.pk], self.using)`, add a line to set the instance's PK to `None`.



These changes ensure that instances fast-deleted, with no dependencies, will have their primary key set to `None` post-deletion, making the deletion process more consistent and predictable.
