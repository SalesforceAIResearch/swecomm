**Title**: Fix NotSupportedError When Filtering on Fields with `filterable=False` Attribute in Django Models

**Problem**:
When filtering `ProductMetaData` with a `metadata_type`, Django raises a `NotSupportedError` due to a field having `filterable=False`. The error occurs during a query operation in the Django ORM.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because Django 3.0 introduced strict checks on whether fields can be used in filter clauses based on their attributes. If a field's `filterable` attribute is set to `False`, Django raises a `NotSupportedError` when trying to include it in filtering operations. 

In this case, the `ProductMetaDataType` model has a Boolean field `filterable`, which should determine whether the field can be used in filtering queries. This field attribute is being checked in the `check_filterable` function in Djangoâ€™s ORM during the query build phase, resulting in the error.

To resolve this, we will update the `check_filterable` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` to allow filtering on fields that do not have the `filterable` attribute explicitly set.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Update the `check_filterable` method in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.
2. Modify the logic in `check_filterable` to allow filtering on fields even if their `filterable` attribute is set to `False`. 

**File**: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`
- **Method**: `check_filterable`

### Proposed Changes Description:
1. Locate the `check_filterable` method within `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.
2. Modify the internal logic to check if the field has the `filterable` attribute and its value.
3. Allow filtering on fields unless explicitly disallowed (`filterable=True`).

**Example Plan**:
1. **Locate the `check_filterable` method**: Find this method typically around line 1120 in `query.py`.
2. **Modify the `check_filterable` method**:
    - Check if the field has the `filterable` attribute set to `False`.
    - If not, it should proceed without raising the `NotSupportedError`.

3. **Update logic**:
    - Replace the current check with a conditional statement that bypasses the restriction unless explicitly necessary.

The final implementation should ensure that if a field does not have `filterable=False`, filtering operations should proceed without raising an error.

This targeted change will resolve the issue without broadly altering Django's filtering behavior across the project.
