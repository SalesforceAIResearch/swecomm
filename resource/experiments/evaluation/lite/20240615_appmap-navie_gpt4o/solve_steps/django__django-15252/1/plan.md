**Title**: Modify MigrationRecorder to Respect Database Router's allow_migrate Rules

**Problem**:
The `MigrationRecorder` does not currently respect the `allow_migrate` rules defined in a custom database router, leading to the creation of the `django_migrations` table on databases that should not have it, according to the router rules.

**Analysis**:
The issue stems from the `ensure_schema` method in `MigrationRecorder`, which checks for the presence of the `django_migrations` table and creates it if not found. This behavior does not take `allow_migrate` rules from any custom `db_router` into consideration. The same issue is likely present in other methods like `record_applied` and `record_unapplied`.

To address this, we need to modify `MigrationRecorder` methods to respect the db router's `allow_migrate` rules, ensuring that the migration schema changes are only applied to databases authorized by the router.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File: `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`**
   - **Method: `ensure_schema`**:
     Modify this method to check with the db router's `allow_migrate` method before attempting to create the `django_migrations` table.

     Changes:
     - Before checking the existence of the table, use the router to determine if migrations are allowed on the current database.
  
2. **File: `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`**
   - **Method: `record_applied`**:
     Modify this method to respect the db router's `allow_migrate` rules before recording an applied migration.

     Changes:
     - Before calling `ensure_schema`, use the router to determine if migrations are allowed on the current database.
  
3. **File: `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`**
   - **Method: `record_unapplied`**:
     Modify this method to respect the db router's `allow_migrate` rules before recording an unapplied migration.

     Changes:
     - Before calling `ensure_schema`, use the router to determine if migrations are allowed on the current database.

4. **File: `django/db/migrations/executor.py`**
   - **Method calls to `self.record_migration`**:
     Ensure that migration records are checked against the router's `allow_migrate` rule before being recorded as applied or unapplied.

     Changes:
     - Ensure all instances where `self.recorder` methods are called respect the routerâ€™s `allow_migrate` rule.

**Details of Changes**:

1. **Method: `ensure_schema`**:
   - Add logic at the beginning to check if migrations are allowed on the current connection using the db router's `allow_migrate` method.

2. **Method: `record_applied`**:
   - Add a check to determine if migrations are allowed on the current database connection before calling `ensure_schema`.

3. **Method: `record_unapplied`**:
   - Add a check to determine if migrations are allowed on the current database connection before calling `ensure_schema`.

**Conclusion**:
These changes should ensure that the `MigrationRecorder` respects the `allow_migrate` rules set by the database router, preventing the creation of the `django_migrations` table on unauthorized databases and ensuring proper multi-database behavior.
