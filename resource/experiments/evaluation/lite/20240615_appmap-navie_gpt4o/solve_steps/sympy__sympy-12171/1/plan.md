**Title**: Correct Derivative and Float handling in Mathematica code printer

**Problem**: 
The current Mathematica code printer does not correctly handle derivatives and floats with exponents. Specifically, derivatives such as `Derivative(f(t), t)` are printed as `Derivative(f(t), t)` instead of `D[f[t], t]`, and floats like `1.0e-4` are not converted to the proper Mathematica format `1.0*^-4`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause lies in the printer's `_print_Derivative` and `_print_Float` methods, which are either not defined or not correctly implemented to produce the desired Mathematica syntax. The fix involves adding these methods to the `MCodePrinter` class with the correct formatting logic.

For derivatives, the method should convert expressions like `Derivative(f(t), t)` to `D[f[t], t]`. For floats, the method should replace the `e` in scientific notation with `*^` to achieve the proper format.

**Proposed Changes**:
The goal is to enhance the `MCodePrinter` within the `sympy/printing/mathematica.py` file to correctly handle derivatives and floats.

1. Modify the `MCodePrinter` class in `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`:

    * Add the `_print_Derivative` method to format derivatives as `D[f[t], t]`.
    * Add the `_print_Float` method to format floats in the scientific notation with `*^`.

**File and Function Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`
    * **Function**: `_print_Derivative`
      - Logic: Convert `expr` to `D[%s]` where `%s` is the stringified arguments of `expr`.
    * **Function**: `_print_Float`
      - Logic: Replace `e` in the string representation of `expr` with `*^`.

    Detailed changes:
    - Locate the class `MCodePrinter` within `sympy/printing/mathematica.py`.
    - Add the following private methods to `MCodePrinter`:

      

This ensures both derivative and float handling are in line with Mathematica's expected format. By making these changes, derivatives and floats are correctly printed, improving the compatibility and correctness of the Mathematica code output.
