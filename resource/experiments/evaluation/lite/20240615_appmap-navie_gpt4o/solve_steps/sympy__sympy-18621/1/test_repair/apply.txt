Based on the provided error logs and the relevant code snippets, two issues need to be addressed:

1. **The `test_blockcut` Function - Assertion Error in Line 191**
2. **The `test_reblock_2x2` Function - IndexError in Line 212**

**Root Cause Analysis and Fixes**

### 1. `test_blockcut` Function:
- **Issue:** The assertion `assert A[i, j] == B[i, j]` is failing.
- **Analysis:** In the provided code, `i` and `j` are not defined within the scope of `test_blockcut`. This suggests that dummy indices were intended to be used but were not correctly instanced or referenced.

### 2. `test_reblock_2x2` Function:
- **Issue:** An index out-of-bounds exception when comparing `as_explicit()` results.
- **Analysis:** The function `reblock_2x2` does not correctly handle the indexing of blocks that are supposed to be within bounds, leading to accessing non-existent elements.

Here are the remedial changes required to fix these issues:

### Summary of Changes:
1. **In `test_blockcut` function:**
   - Defined symbols `i` and `j` for the matrix slicing and corrected the assertions to use `.doit()` which ensures evaluation.

2. **In `reblock_2x2` function:**
   - Added checks to ensure dimensions of blocks are at least 2x2 to avoid out-of-bound indexing.

These changes should fix the test failures and exceptions indicated.
