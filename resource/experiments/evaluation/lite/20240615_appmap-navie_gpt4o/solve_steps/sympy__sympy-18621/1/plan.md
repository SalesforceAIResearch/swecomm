**Title**: Fix TypeError when converting BlockDiagMatrix with one element to Matrix

**Problem**: Creating a `BlockDiagMatrix` with a single `Matrix` element and attempting to convert it back to a regular `Matrix` raises a `TypeError`. This issue occurs in sympy 1.5.1 but not in sympy 1.4.

**Analysis**: The `BlockDiagMatrix` is intended to create a block diagonal matrix formed from multiple matrix blocks. When only one matrix block is used, the internal structure and implementation cause a `TypeError` during the conversion to a regular `Matrix`. Specifically, the issue happens in the `BlockDiagMatrix`'s `_entry` method when it tries to access a single element in the matrix, interpreting a scalar as a subscriptable object, causing the error `TypeError: 'One' object is not subscriptable`.

In sympy 1.4, this functionality was correctly handled, suggesting that changes between versions led to this error. The root cause is likely tied to the `_entry` method of the `BlockDiagMatrix` class and how it handles its internal blocks when the blocks list contains only one element.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py**:
    - Modify the `_entry` method of the `BlockDiagMatrix` class.
    - Add a conditional check to handle the case where the `BlockDiagMatrix` contains only one block and directly return the matrix entry instead of treating it like a block structure.
    - Ensure that the method correctly interprets a single matrix block as a block matrix entity.

**Detailed steps for modifications**:

1. **sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py**:
    - Locate the `BlockDiagMatrix` class and within it, the `_entry` method which handles element access.
    - Modify the `_entry` method to check if the `BlockDiagMatrix` consists of only one block:
        - If there is only one block, directly retrieve and return the entry from the single matrix block.
        - If there are multiple blocks, retain the existing behavior.

    

With these changes, the conversion of a `BlockDiagMatrix` with one element back to a regular `Matrix` should function correctly, eliminating the `TypeError`. This solution addresses the logic handling single-block scenarios without disrupting the default multi-block operations.
