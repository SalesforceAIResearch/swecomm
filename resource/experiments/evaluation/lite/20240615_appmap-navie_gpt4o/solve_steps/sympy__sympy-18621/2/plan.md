### Modify BlockDiagMatrix to Handle Single Element Conversion

**Problem:**
When attempting to convert a single-element BlockDiagMatrix back to a regular Matrix in sympy version 1.5.1, a `TypeError` is raised. This error does not occur in sympy version 1.4.

**Analysis:**
The issue originates from how the `BlockDiagMatrix` handles its internal structure when it contains only a single element. Specifically, in the `as_explicit` method of `matexpr.py` and the `_entry` method of `blockmatrix.py`, the code tries to subscript an object that isn't subscriptable when there's only one block.

To solve this, the necessary modifications involve ensuring that the conversion logic can handle the single block case correctly. We will need to adjust the `_entry` method to handle the case where there's a single block without attempting to subscript it.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File: sympy/matrices/expressions/blockmatrix.py**
   - **Function:** `_entry`
   - **Line Range:** 240-250 (approx.)
   - Modify the `_entry` method to check if there's only one block and directly return the element instead of attempting any subscripting.

   Detailed steps for the changes:
   - Check if `self.blocks` contains only one element.
   - If yes, return the element directly.
   - Otherwise, proceed with the existing logic of locating and returning the subscripted element.



These changes ensure that the `BlockDiagMatrix` can handle scenarios where it contains only a single block matrix, ensuring no errors occur during conversion.

Note: Ensure thorough testing is done post these modifications to validate that multi-block `BlockDiagMatrix` instances continue to perform as expected and no regression is introduced.
