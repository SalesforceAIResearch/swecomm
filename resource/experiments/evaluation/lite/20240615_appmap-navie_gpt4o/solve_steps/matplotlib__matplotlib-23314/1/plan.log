**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

[Bug]: set_visible() not working for 3d projection 
### Bug summary

in the subplot projection="3d" the set_visible function doesn't work even if the value is set to False

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.gridspec import GridSpec

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'})
ax1.scatter(1,1,1)
ax2.scatter(1,1,1, c='r')
ax1.set_visible(False)

plt.show()
# Thanks Tim for your help! 
```


### Actual outcome

the subplot remains visible which should not happen if the value is set to False

### Expected outcome

the subplot is not visible if the value is set to False

### Additional information

_No response_

### Operating system

_No response_
