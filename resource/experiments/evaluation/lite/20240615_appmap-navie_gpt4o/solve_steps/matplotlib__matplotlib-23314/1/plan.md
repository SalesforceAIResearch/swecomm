**Title**: Fix `set_visible()` not working for 3D projections in Matplotlib

**Problem**:  
In the subplot with `projection='3d'`, the `set_visible` method does not hide the 3D subplot even when the visibility is explicitly set to `False`.

**Analysis**:  
The `set_visible` method is responsible for toggling the visibility of a subplot. However, it appears that this method does not correctly hide subplots when using a 3D projection. The likely cause is that the visibility state changes are not properly propagated to the 3D axes rendering pipeline, meaning the axes remains visible even when `set_visible(False)` is called.

**Proposed Changes**:  
To rectify this issue, it is necessary to ensure the `set_visible` method in the relevant class correctly updates and handles the visibility state for 3D projections. We need to update the `Axes3D` class, which is located in `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`. Hereâ€™s how we can proceed:

1. **Locate the `Axes3D` class**:
   Navigate to the file `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py` and locate the `Axes3D` class. This class should contain the implementation of various 3D plotting functionalities.

2. **Update the `set_visible` method**:
   Within the `Axes3D` class, ensure that the `set_visible` method exists or override it to handle the visibility of all 3D components properly. If the `set_visible` method is not defined, it needs to be implemented. Make sure the method explicitly sets the visibility for all components (like lines, text, patches) of the 3D subplot.

3. **Modify the `set_visible` method**:
   Ensure the method looks something like this:

   

Files to be modified:

- `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`: Add or update the `set_visible` method in the `Axes3D` class to ensure 3D components' visibility is properly managed.

Carefully test the changes to ensure the issue is resolved without introducing new bugs. Validate all existing functionalities to confirm they work as expected after the modification.
