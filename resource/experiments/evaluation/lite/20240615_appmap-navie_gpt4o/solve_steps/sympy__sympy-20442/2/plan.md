**Title**: Fix convert_to to handle orthogonal unit conversions correctly

**Problem**: The `convert_to` function in sympy combines orthogonal units incorrectly. For example, converting `joule*second` to `joule` returns `joule**(7/9)` instead of the expected `joule*second`, an expression in base units, or an error.

**Analysis**: The root cause of the issue seems to be that `convert_to` can only handle conversions for expressions where the complete unit expression is valid. When orthogonal units are present (e.g., `joule*second`), it improperly tries to combine them, leading to nonsensical results like `joule**(7/9)`. The function should instead recognize when units are orthogonal and either return the original expression, convert to base units, or raise an error when conversion is not feasible.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/physics/units/util.py`
    1. Modify the `convert_to` function to detect orthogonal units. When detected, the function should either:
       - Return the original expression if no sensible conversion is possible.
       - Convert the expression to its base units if applicable.
       - Raise an error if the conversion is ambiguous or not feasible.
    2. Update the logic to ensure it does not combine orthogonal units inappropriately.

Changes Needed:
1. **detect and handle orthogonal units**:
   - Check if the target units and source units are orthogonal.
   - Use unit conversion logic to appropriately manage known unit conversions.

2. **Integrate error checking**:
   - Raise a meaningful error if the combination or conversion of units is not feasible.

3. **Preserve the original expression's base units**:
   - If a full conversion isn't possible, attempt to reduce the expression to the most simplified form using base units.

By implementing these changes, the `convert_to` function will better handle cases with orthogonal units, ensuring it returns logical and expected results. The goal is to avoid nonsensical outputs and instead provide meaningful conversions or clear error messages when a conversion isn't possible.
