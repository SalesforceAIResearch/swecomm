**Title:** Fix `convert_to` Function to Avoid Combining Orthogonal Units

**Problem:**
The `convert_to` function in the SymPy library improperly handles conversions involving combined orthogonal units. For instance, converting `joule*second` to `joule` results in `joule**(7/9)` rather than the expected original expression or an appropriate expression in base units.

**Analysis:**
In the `convert_to` function, the root cause is likely in the unit conversion logic, which might not correctly handle cases where the units being converted are orthogonal (i.e., do not share the same dimension). Consequently, this results in unexpected and incorrect output.

One possible place to look is the method `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`, which constructs the conversion matrix. If this method does not take into account orthogonal units correctly, it can produce a conversion matrix that leads to erroneous results. Fixing this function to better handle orthogonal units should resolve the issue.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File:** `sympy/physics/units/util.py`
   
   - Modify the `convert_to` function to add a check for orthogonal units. This involves ensuring the units are compatible before proceeding with the conversion logic.
   - Update the `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr` function to correctly handle orthogonal units. This might involve adding logic to identify when units are orthogonal and handle these cases separately.
   - Enhance the `get_total_scale_factor` to handle cases where the dimension analysis should identify orthogonal units and deal with them appropriately.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. **In `convert_to` function:**
    - Before calling `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`, check if `expr` and `target_units` are orthogonal. This could be done by comparing their dimensions - if their dimensions are not the same, they are orthogonal.
    - If the units are identified as orthogonal, decide on how to handle it. Options include returning the original expression unchanged or throwing an error.

2. **In `_get_conversion_matrix_for_expr`:**
    - Add logic to handle the identification of orthogonal units as mentioned above. Ensure that when orthogonal units are detected, the correct behavior (decided in step 1) is implemented.

3. **In `get_total_scale_factor`:**
    - Ensure that the method correctly understands and processes orthogonal units, returning appropriate scale factors only for compatible dimensions.

These changes should collectively ensure that the `convert_to` function handles orthogonal unit conversions properly, either by returning the original expression, converting to base units appropriately, or raising an error when conversion is not feasible.
