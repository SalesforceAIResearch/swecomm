### Title

Correct unit handling in convert_to with orthogonal units

### Problem

In `sympy`, the function `convert_to` is combining orthogonal units incorrectly. When given a compound unit expression (e.g., `joule*second`), it produces unexpected results instead of returning the original expression, an expression in base units, or an error. This issue is potentially due to mishandling cases where the compound unit expression does not directly map to a single physical unit.

### Analysis

The `convert_to` function is failing when faced with compound unit expressions involving orthogonal units. This likely stems from the simplifying transformations the function applies internally, causing it to erroneously try and combine units that are fundamentally different. To fix this issue, the function should be adjusted to:

1. Recognize compound units and maintain their structure.
2. Handle cases where the target unit expression does not match exactly by either:
   - Returning the original compound expression.
   - Transforming the expression into base units.
   - Raising an appropriate error when conversion isnâ€™t possible.

This can be achieved realistically by adding checks and safeguards in the `convert_to` function to identify and appropriately manage orthogonal units.

### Proposed Changes

**File**: `sympy/physics/units/util.py`

1. **Function to be modified**: `convert_to`
   
2. **Logic Modifications**:
   - Before attempting any conversions, add a check to detect compound unit expressions.
   - If the target unit matches exactly, return the original expression directly.
   - If the target unit can be expressed in base units, perform the conversion to those base units.
   - If neither of the above conditions are met, raise a ValueError indicating that the conversion is unsupported for orthogonal units.
   
   Change details:
   - Insert checks at the beginning of `convert_to` to evaluate if the units are orthogonal (i.e., not directly convertible).
   - Modify the conversion logic to ensure it produces meaningful results or raises an error in cases where no valid conversion exists.

By making these changes, the behavior of `convert_to` will be more predictable and handle orthogonal units correctly, improving both the usability and reliability of the function.

Remember, testing and validation of the changes should be performed separately to ensure proper functionality across a wide range of unit expressions beyond the given examples.
