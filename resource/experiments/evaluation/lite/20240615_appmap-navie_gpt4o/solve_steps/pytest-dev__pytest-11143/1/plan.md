### Title:
Resolve TypeError in assertion rewrite when the first expression of a file is a number

### Problem:
In specific test cases, `pytest` raises a `TypeError` with the message "argument of type 'int' is not iterable." This error occurs during the assertion rewrite phase when the first expression in the file being parsed is a number. The issue stems from the function `is_rewrite_disabled` in `AssertionRewriter`, which assumes the first expression to be a docstring and does not handle cases where it might be a different data type, such as an integer.

### Analysis:
The primary cause of the error is that the `is_rewrite_disabled` method attempts to check if the string `"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE"` is present within what it assumes to be a docstring. However, if the first expression in the body of the module is an integer or any non-string datatype, the check will raise a `TypeError` because the `in` keyword cannot operate on non-iterable types.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the code to ensure it handles non-string expressions appropriately by verifying the type before performing the "in" check. This will ensure the method does not raise an exception when it encounters non-string expressions.

### Proposed Changes:

#### File: `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`

1. **Function: `is_rewrite_disabled(docstring: str) -> bool`**
   - Update the method to check if `docstring` is of type `str` before performing the "in" check.
   - This should prevent the `TypeError` when `docstring` is not a string and thus not iterable.

#### Modify lines:
- `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py: 744-763`

#### Steps:
1. Locate the `is_rewrite_disabled` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class.
2. Update the method to ensure it performs a type check before searching for `"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE"`.

#### Example:



This update will ensure that the method only performs the "in" check if the `docstring` is indeed a string. Otherwise, it will safely return `False`, allowing the method to handle non-string expressions gracefully.

3. Verify other places in the class where `doc` or `docstring` might be used for similar string operations and apply similar type checks if necessary.

### Conclusion:
By modifying the `is_rewrite_disabled` method to include a type check, we can prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when the first expression in a file is a non-string datatype, such as an integer. This fix ensures robust handling of varied inputs and maintains the overall functionality of assertion rewriting.
