**Title**: Add `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets

**Problem**

Currently, FormSets in Django do not provide a distinct CSS class for non-form errors, while individual forms utilize the `nonfield` CSS class for non-field errors. This inconsistency makes it difficult to differentiate between non-field errors in forms and non-form errors in formsets when rendering the error messages in custom ErrorList instances.

**Analysis**

To address this inconsistently, we need to add a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets. This would involve updating the `error_class` instance whenever a non-form error is encountered during validation and ensuring that this new CSS class is appropriately applied.

The primary function to update is the one that handles the non-form errors in formsets so that it applies the `nonform` CSS class to these errors. This approach will allow custom `ErrorList`s to make distinctions between form field errors, non-field errors, and non-form errors, improving the granularity and clarity of error rendering.

**Proposed Changes**

1. **File: `django/forms/formsets.py`**

   - Modify the `full_clean` method to apply the `nonform` CSS class to `_non_form_errors`.

   - Specifically, where non-form errors are appended to `_non_form_errors`, update the `error_class` to include the new `nonform` CSS class.

2. **File: `django/forms/utils.py`**

   - Ensure that the `ErrorList` class in `utils.py` can handle different CSS classes including `nonform`.

Details on the changes required:

### File: `django/forms/formsets.py`

- Locate the `full_clean` method. Toward the end of this method, where `_non_form_errors` is created, set the `error_class` with the `nonform` CSS class.


   self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(error_class='nonform')
   plaintext
3. Make sure that the `ErrorList` class in `utils.py` can process and appropriately store the error messages linked with the `nonform` CSS class.
```

By making these changes, we will be able to standardize error class handling for both forms and formsets, thus allowing developers to more easily customize and render error messages with improved clarity and distinction.
