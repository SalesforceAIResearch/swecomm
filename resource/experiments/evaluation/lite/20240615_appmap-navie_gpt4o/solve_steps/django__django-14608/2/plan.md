**Title: Add `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets**

**Problem:**
FormSets currently lack a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors, making it difficult to distinguish between form field errors, non-field errors (forms), and non-form errors (FormSets) when rendering error messages. This inconsistency can cause challenges for developers who want to customize error displays.

**Analysis:**
When a FormSet contains non-form errors, these errors should be styled distinctly. While forms use a `nonfield` CSS class for non-field errors, no equivalent exists for FormSets. By introducing a `nonform` CSS class, developers can easily differentiate between various types of errors through CSS. The requested change involves ensuring that non-form errors are appended with the `nonform` class within the error list.

To implement this adjustment, the logic which processes and renders these errors within the FormSet will need modification. Specifically, the `non_form_errors` method and associated error handling routines in the FormSet class will need updates to append the `nonform` class to non-form errors.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: `django/forms/formsets.py`**
    - Update the `_non_form_errors` attribute initialization in the `full_clean` method to include the `nonform` CSS class.
    - The `non_form_errors` method needs to return errors with the `nonform` CSS class.

**Detailed Description:**

- **Modify the `full_clean` method (line 332) in `django/forms/formsets.py`**:
    - When initializing the `_non_form_errors` attribute, initialize it with an `ErrorList` instance and pass the `nonform` CSS class as an argument.

    Example line before modification:
    

    After modification:
    

- **Update the `non_form_errors` method (line 296) in `django/forms/formsets.py`**:
    - Make sure this method still performs a full clean if `_non_form_errors` has not been initialized, and then returns `_non_form_errors` with the `nonform` CSS class.

    Example:
    

By making these changes, the FormSet class will now apply a `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors, consistent with how forms handle `nonfield` errors. This will enhance developer experience by allowing them to style and distinguish non-form errors effectively.
