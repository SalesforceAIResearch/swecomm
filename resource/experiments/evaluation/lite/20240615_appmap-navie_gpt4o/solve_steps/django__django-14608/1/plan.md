**Title**: Add `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets

**Problem**: FormSets currently do not add a `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in ErrorList instances. This makes it difficult for a custom ErrorList to distinguish between field errors, non-field errors (for forms), and non-form errors (for FormSets) while rendering error messages.

**Analysis**: The `ErrorList` instances for FormSets currently do not differentiate non-form errors with a special CSS class. Adding a `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors will allow custom `ErrorList` implementations to easily differentiate these types of errors when rendering them in HTML, similar to how `nonfield` CSS class is added for form-related non-field errors as described in the Django documentation. The changes should ensure non-form errors in FormSets are tagged with this new CSS class.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/forms/formsets.py`
   - Update the method that constructs the non-form errors list in FormSets to append the `nonform` CSS class to the error list.

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. **Method**: `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors`
   - Modify the method to use an `ErrorList` that adds the `nonform` CSS class.
   - Update the initialization of `_non_form_errors` to include the additional CSS class. This ensures that when `self.full_clean()` is called, any errors appended will carry the non-form distinctive CSS class.

2. **Method**: `BaseFormSet.full_clean`
   - Ensure when instantiating the `_non_form_errors` attribute, an instance of `ErrorList` with the `nonform` CSS class is used.

### Changes Required:

#### 1. Modify `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors` Method:
- Update the property to instantiate `_non_form_errors` as an `ErrorList` with the `nonform` CSS class.

#### 2. Modify `BaseFormSet.full_clean` Method:
- When initializing `_non_form_errors`, ensure it is instantiated with the `nonform` CSS class.

By making these modifications, FormSets will now distinguish non-form errors from other error types by applying the `nonform` CSS class, thereby aiding developers in customizing error presentations effectively.
