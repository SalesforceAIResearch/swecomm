### Title
Modify expr.atoms() to return objects with no args instead of subclasses of Atom

### Problem
The `expr.atoms()` function currently returns subclasses of `Atom` within an expression. However, the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args` rather than strictly being a subclass of `Atom`.

### Analysis
In the current implementation, `expr.atoms()` returns instances of `sympy.Atom` subclasses. While this works to identify atomic elements in many cases, there is inconsistency because this approach relies on class inheritance rather than the actual structural properties of the nodes. Specifically, a leaf node in an expression should be defined by having no arguments (`.args` should be empty), which is a more general and correct criterion for determining leaf nodes in a symbolic expression.

The current function needs to be adjusted to check for objects that have no `.args` rather than simply being instances of subclasses of `Atom`. This modification should be carefully tested to ensure it doesn't degrade performance or introduce unintended behavior in other parts of the library.

### Proposed Changes
#### File: sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py
1. **Modify existing functions that utilize `expr.atoms()` to ensure they reflect this new definition:**
    - Functions that are focused on extracting atomic elements should observe the new definition where a node is considered atomic if it has no `.args`.

- #### Function: `convert_atom`
  Modify the function call to replace its existing atomic check:
  
  

- #### Function: `handle_integral`
  Modify to reflect the updated understanding of atomic symbols:
  
  

- #### Function: `do_subs`
  Similar modification for the check of atomic elements:
  
  

### Summary
This change involves all instances where `expr.atoms()` is being used with an argument defining the type of atom. Instead, we filter out the objects in `expr.atoms()` that have no `.args` to redefine our atomic elements correctly. The changes should be minimal but far-reaching to ensure the correct structure of expressions is consistently used across the library.
