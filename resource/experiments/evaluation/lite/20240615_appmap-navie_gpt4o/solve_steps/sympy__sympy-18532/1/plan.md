**Title:** Modify expr.atoms() to Return Objects with No Arguments Instead of Subclasses of Atom

**Problem:** 
Currently, the `expr.atoms()` method returns instances of the `Atom` subclass in SymPy expressions. However, the correct definition of a leaf node in the expression tree should be objects that have no `.args`. This discrepancy can result in incorrect representation or processing of leaf nodes.

**Analysis:** 
The current implementation of the `expr.atoms()` method relies on checking if elements are instances of the `Atom` subclass. While `Atom` is useful for defining basic components like symbols and numbers, a more accurate approach would involve checking if objects have no arguments (`.args`). This method change requires updating the logic so that it identifies nodes based on the absence of `.args` rather than using subclass checks. Itâ€™s essential to ensure this modification does not negatively impact performance.

**Proposed Changes:** 
### File to Modify: `sympy/parsing/latex/_parse_latex_antlr.py`

1. **Update the `convert_atom` function:**
   - Modify the logic where atoms are processed to use `.args` check instead of class instance checks.

2. **Update the `convert_comp` function:**
   - Ensure that the conversion properly accommodates changes in `convert_atom`.

3. **Update the `handle_integral` function:**
   - Adjust logic where atoms are involved if necessary to align with changes in `convert_atom`.

### Detailed Description of Changes:

#### In `convert_atom` function:
- Modify checks for `atom.LETTER()`, `atom.SYMBOL()`, `atom.NUMBER()`, `atom.DIFFERENTIAL()`, `atom.mathit()` to use condition `if not atom.args`.

#### In `convert_comp` function:
- Ensure when calling `convert_atom`, it handles nodes without `.args`.

#### In `handle_integral` function:
- Identify the integration variable as instances with no `.args`.

### Example Change (conceptual):
- Change from:
  
  To:
  

### Performance Consideration:
- After updating the condition checks, conduct performance tests to ensure there is no degradation. If performance is impacted, consider optimizing the `.args` check or refactoring the logic to enhance efficiency.

This change should rectify the identification of leaf nodes correctly and streamline the functioning of various mathematical parsing and processing functions that depend on `expr.atoms`.
