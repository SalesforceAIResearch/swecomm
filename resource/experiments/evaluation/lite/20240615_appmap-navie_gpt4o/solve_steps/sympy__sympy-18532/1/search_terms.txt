<issue>
expr.atoms() should return objects with no args instead of subclasses of Atom
`expr.atoms()` with no arguments returns subclasses of `Atom` in `expr`. But the correct definition of a leaf node should be that it has no `.args`. 

This should be easy to fix, but one needs to check that this doesn't affect the performance.
