**Title**: Catch and Re-raise `socket.error` as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`

**Problem**: The `socket.error` exception is not being caught and re-raised as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This causes the raw `socket.error` to propagate up the call stack, which is inconsistent with the behavior users expect when using the `requests` library.

**Analysis**: 
The `requests` library abstracts the complexities of HTTP communication, and users typically expect exceptions to be wrapped within `requests` exceptions rather than handling lower-level socket exceptions directly. The trace shows that a `socket.error` (`[Errno 104] Connection reset by peer`) is being raised during a read operation in the `urllib3` response, which then propagates through the call stack up to the `requests` model layer.

To resolve this, we need to catch the `socket.error` in the appropriate position within the `requests` or `urllib3` code and then re-raise it as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This will maintain the expected abstraction and exception handling model of the `requests` library.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`
    - **Modification Needed**: In the `read` and `stream` methods of `HTTPResponse`, wrap the call to `self._fp.read` (and any other socket operations) in a `try-except` block. On catching a `socket.error`, raise a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.
    
    - **Description of Changes**:
        - In the `read` method of `HTTPResponse` class, add a `try-except` block around `self._fp.read` to catch `socket.error`.
        - Re-raise the exception as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError` with an appropriate error message and include the original exception.

2. **File**: `requests/models.py`
    - **Modification Needed**: Ensure `requests` model methods like `iter_content`, `generate`, and any relevant higher-level method handle the re-raised `ConnectionError` properly, if not already handled.
    
    - **Description of Changes**:
        - Review methods like `iter_content` and `generate` to check error handling for `ConnectionError` and ensure no changes are necessary.

**Detailed Steps for `requests/packages/urllib3/response.py`**:

1. Add the `try-except` block to catch the `socket.error` around the reading operations in the `read` method:
    - Locate the `read` method in `HTTPResponse`.
    - Wrap the entire read operation and any other potential socket interaction in a `try-except` block.
    - Catch `socket.error` and re-raise it as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

2. Repeat a similar process for the `stream` method in `HTTPResponse`:
    - Locate the `stream` method in `HTTPResponse`.
    - Wrap the yield statements obtaining data from socket reads in a `try-except` block.
    - Catch and re-raise the `socket.error` as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`.

This approach keeps the changes minimal and localized to the most relevant sections of the codebase. Thus, users of the `requests` library will continue to experience consistent and expected exception handling.
