**Title**: Reorder Migrations for AlterOrderWithRespectTo Before AddIndex on '_order'

**Problem**: When defining the model `LookImage`, the migration fails due to the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation being executed after an `AddIndex` operation that includes `_order` field. The `_order` field is in existence only after `order_with_respect_to` is set, which leads to a crash.

**Analysis**: The issue arises because the `_order` field is automatically managed by Django and is added dynamically when `order_with_respect_to` is set. Any index on this `_order` field should logically be created after the `_order` field is available. If the `AddIndex` operation precedes the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation, it tries to create an index on a non-existent `_order` field, causing a crash.

To resolve this, the sequence of operations in the migration file needs to be modified so that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before any `AddIndex` operations that involve the `_order` field.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. File `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`:
    - Modify the sequence of operation execution to ensure `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before the `AddIndex` operation that includes `_order`.

Detailed steps:

1. Open the migration file that is causing the issue or the logic where operations are registered.

2. Locate the section where migrations operations are being defined:

    

3. Rearrange the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation to come before `AddIndex` operations involving `_order`:

    

By ensuring that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is processed before the index creation, it guarantees that the `_order` field is created and available when the `AddIndex` operation is executed, avoiding any database errors related to the missing `_order` field.
