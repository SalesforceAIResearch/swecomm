**Title**: Reorder Migrations to Ensure `_order` Field is Created Before Being Indexed

**Problem**: 
The `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` migration operation is causing a crash when attempting to apply an index on the `_order` field because the field has not been created yet. The issue arises because the `_order` field automatically created by the `order_with_respect_to` attribute in Django models needs to exist before it can be referenced in an index.

**Analysis**: 
The core issue is the order of migration operations. The `_order` field is implicitly created by the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation. If an index on `_order` is defined before this operation is applied, Django will fail because it attempts to create an index on a non-existent field. Thus, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation should be positioned before any `AddIndex` operations that reference the `_order` field.

Here's how the migration should be logically structured:
1. Creation of the model (`CreateModel`).
2. Alter the model to set `order_with_respect_to`, which implicitly creates the `_order` field (`AlterOrderWithRespectTo`).
3. Add indexes on the fields, including the newly created `_order` field (`AddIndex`).

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `your_migration_file.py` (The specific migration file where these operations are defined)

    - **Reorder Migration Operations**:
      - Ensure that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation appears before the `AddIndex` operation for indexes referencing the `_order` field.

**Details of the Change**:
1. **In your_migration_file.py**:
   - Locate the migration operations where the `AddIndex` is being performed.
   - Before these `AddIndex` operations, move the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation.
   
   - Old Order:
     
   
   - New Order:
     

By reordering these operations, you ensure that the `_order` field is created by the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any index attempts to reference it, thus resolving the migration error.
