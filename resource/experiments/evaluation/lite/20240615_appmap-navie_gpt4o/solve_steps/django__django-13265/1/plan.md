### Title
Reorder AlterOrderWithRespectTo Migration to Precede AddIndex for '_order' Field

### Problem
When running Django migrations that include both `migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `migrations.AddIndex`, an error occurs because the `'_order'` field—which is used in the index—has not yet been created. This results in a crash, as indices involving the `'_order'` field cannot be created before the field itself exists.

### Analysis
The root of the problem lies in the order in which the migration operations are executed. Specifically, the `migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation, which sets the `order_with_respect_to` attribute and subsequently creates the internal `'_order'` field, is being executed after the `migrations.AddIndex` operations. Consequently, the index creation fails because the `'_order'` field is not present at the time the index is being added.

The appropriate solution is to reorder the migration operations such that the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation occurs before any `AddIndex` operations that depend on the `'_order'` field. This ensures that the `'_order'` field is created before the index is applied, thus preventing the crash.

### Proposed Changes
To resolve this issue, adjust the order of operations in the migration file to ensure that `migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is executed before any `migrations.AddIndex` operations that involve the `'_order'` field. The suggested file and functions to modify include:

1. **Migration File (auto-generated)_**
   - This change will need to be performed in the auto-generated migration file for the model `LookImage`.

#### Specific Changes
1. Move the `migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation before any `migrations.AddIndex` operations involving `'_order'`.
2. Ensure that all operations follow the correct sequence without dependency conflicts.

#### Detailed Description of the Necessary Change
1. **Migration File (AddModel LookImage)**
   - Ensure the `migrations.AlterOrderWithRespectTo` precedes `migrations.AddIndex`.



By making these changes, the migration process will ensure that the `'_order'` field exists before any index involving it is created, thus preventing the crash and ensuring smooth database schema evolution.
