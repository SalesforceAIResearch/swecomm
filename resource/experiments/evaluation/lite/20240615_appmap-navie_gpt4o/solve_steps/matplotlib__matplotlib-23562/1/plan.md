**Title**: Fix AttributeError in 'get_facecolors()' for 'Poly3DCollection' object in plot_surface method

**Problem**: 
The function `get_facecolors()` in `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.Poly3DCollection` class attempts to access an attribute `_facecolors2d` which does not exist, leading to an `AttributeError`.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the `Poly3DCollection` object, responsible for handling the 3D surface plots, lacks an attribute `_facecolors2d`. This attribute should either be defined within the class or an alternative attribute should be used to handle the face colors.

The `Poly3DCollection` class is designed to display 3D polygons and is used by the `plot_surface` method in `Axes3D`. When the `get_facecolors()` method is called, it attempts to access `_facecolors2d`, which is not found. This can happen if `_facecolors2d` was expected to be populated during initialization or a relevant method, but wasn't.

To fix this, the code should ensure `_facecolors2d` is properly defined or substitute it with the correct attribute. `_facecolors2d` might not be properly initialized because the `plot_surface` method might need adjustments to correctly set this attribute.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Modify the `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.py` file to ensure that `_facecolors2d` is defined properly or use an alternative attribute to represent the face colors.

   - Check if `_facecolors2d` is defined within the `__init__` method or relevant methods inside `Poly3DCollection` class.
   - If the class uses a different attribute for face colors (e.g., `_facecolors`), update the `get_facecolors()` method to return the existing attribute.

   Hereâ€™s a detailed description of the changes:
   - **File:** `lib/matplotlib/art3d.py`
   - **Class:** `Poly3DCollection`
   - **Method:** `get_facecolors()`

Modify the `get_facecolors()` method to check for the presence of `_facecolors2d` or fallback to a different attribute:

Current Code:


Proposed Change:


This change will check for `_facecolors2d` attribute; if it doesn't exist, it will call `get_facecolor()`. Ensure `get_facecolor()` should be implemented correctly to return the face color attribute which might be `_facecolors` or another existing attribute.

2. After modifying the method, review the initialization method (likely `__init__`) in the `Poly3DCollection` class:
   - Ensure `_facecolors2d` or an equivalent attribute is initialized and assigned correctly when an object of this class is created.
   
   Example Adjustments:
   

3. Validate the changes:
   - Confirm the fix by running the provided minimal example and ensure no `AttributeError` is raised.
   - Optionally, test other functionalities of `Poly3DCollection` that might be affected to ensure no regressions.

By implementing the above changes, the `Poly3DCollection` should handle `get_facecolors()` calls correctly, ensuring backward compatibility and proper functionality.
