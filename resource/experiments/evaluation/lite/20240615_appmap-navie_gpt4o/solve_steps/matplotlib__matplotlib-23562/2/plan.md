**Title**: Fix AttributeError in 'Poly3DCollection' object for `_facecolors2d`

**Problem**: The `Poly3DCollection` object in `matplotlib`'s `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d` module throws an `AttributeError` when attempting to access the `_facecolors2d` attribute. This issue occurs in the `get_facecolors` method. Users expect this method to return the face colors but encounter an error due to the missing attribute.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is the presence of a method `get_facecolors` in `Poly3DCollection`, which tries to access an attribute `_facecolors2d` that does not exist. This leads to an `AttributeError`. The attribute `_facecolors2d` should either be initialized before it is accessed, or the method should be modified to handle the absence of this attribute gracefully.

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that:

1. The `_facecolors2d` attribute is correctly initialized within the `Poly3DCollection` class.
2. The `get_facecolors` method needs to be robust against the absence of this attribute.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File: `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py`**
   - **Class `Poly3DCollection`**:
     - **Method `__init__`**:
       - Initialize the `_facecolors2d` attribute to avoid `AttributeError`.
     - **Method `get_facecolors`**:
       - Ensure the method checks if the `_facecolors2d` attribute exists. If it does not, set it to a default value or an empty array before returning it.

Detailed changes are outlined below:

- In the `__init__` method of the `Poly3DCollection` class:
  - Initialize the `_facecolors2d` and `_facecolors3d` attributes to an empty array or the appropriate initial values to ensure they exist.

- In the `get_facecolors` method of the `Poly3DCollection` class:
  - Include a check to see if `_facecolors2d` exists. If not, either initialize it or handle its absence appropriately.

By making these changes, the `get_facecolors` method will execute without causing an AttributeError, resolving the issue encountered by users.

**Proposed Changes**:

- **File**: `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/art3d.py`
  - **Function and Logic Modifications**:
    - **In `__init__` method of `Poly3DCollection` class**: Initialize `_facecolors2d` and `_facecolors3d`.
    - **In `get_facecolors` method**: Add checks and initialization.

Implementing these changes will fix the AttributeError by ensuring all necessary attributes are correctly defined and handled, thus making the `get_facecolors` method robust and preventing it from failing when called.
