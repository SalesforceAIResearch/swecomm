**Title**: Fix undefined variable 'cotm' in `coth(log(tan(x))).subs(x, val)`

**Problem**: 
When calling `.subs()` on the expression `coth(log(tan(x)))` for specific integral values of `x` (e.g., 2, 3, 5, 6), a `NameError` occurs due to an undefined variable `cotm` in the `eval` function of the `coth` class in `hyperbolic.py`.

**Analysis**:
The error originates from the `eval` method of the `coth` function in the `definition` of the hyperbolic cotangent. Within the conditional block that handles `arg.is_Add`, `cothm` and `cotm` variables are derived. However, the code incorrectly references `cotm` without defining it in some cases, specifically when checking `if cotm is S.ComplexInfinity`.

This issue can occur when the argument passed to `coth` results in forms that trigger this conditional block (like values derived from certain logarithmic and trigonometric expressions).

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`**:
    - Locate the `eval` method inside the `coth` class.
    - In the conditional block handling `arg.is_Add`, ensure all necessary variables (`cotm`, in this case) are appropriately defined before use.
    - Add the definition or derivation statement for `cotm` where missing or incorrectly placed.

Detailed Steps in the `eval` method:
   - Check the block of code starting with `if arg.is_Add` and ensure both `cotm` and `cothm` are properly initialized based on the decomposed parts of `arg`.

A possible extraction plan:
1. Navigate to the eval method of the `coth` function.
2. Review the segment within `if arg.is_Add`.
3. Confirm the definitions of `cotm` and `cothm`.
4. If `cotm` is undefined, ensure it is derived similarly to `cothm`.

This modification should resolve the `NameError` for `cotm` not being defined, thereby allowing the `.subs()` to complete for integral values without throwing errors.

**Proposed Changes**:

- **File `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`**:
    - Locate the method `eval` inside the `coth` class starting around line 586.
    - Modify the code within the `if arg.is_Add` block to ensure `cotm` is defined.
