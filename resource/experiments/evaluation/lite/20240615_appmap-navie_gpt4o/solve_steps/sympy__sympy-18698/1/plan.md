**Title**: Fix inconsistency in `sqf_list` output for polynomials with identical factors

**Problem**: 
The `sqf_list` function is inconsistently reporting the factors' multiplicities of polynomials. When there are multiple identical factors, it incorrectly lists them separately instead of combining them. For instance, for the polynomial \( (x - 2)^3 \cdot (x - 3)^3 \), it should return a single factor raised to the third power instead of listing each factor multiple times.

**Analysis**:
The problem lies within the implementation of `dup_sqf_list_include` and `dmp_sqf_list_include` functions. These functions handle the square-free decomposition for univariate and multivariate polynomials, respectively. The inconsistency occurs because the current code does not combine identical factors when computing their multiplicities.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **dup_sqf_list_include**:
   - **File**: `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`
   - **Changes**: After computing the factors, check for identical factors and combine them by adjusting their multiplicities.
   - **Description**: Modify the logic after the factors are computed to accumulate the multiplicities of identical factors into a single factor.

2. **dmp_sqf_list_include**:
   - **File**: `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`
   - **Changes**: Similarly to `dup_sqf_list_include`, combine identical factors by summing their multiplicities.
   - **Description**: Adjust the code to combine similar factors and update their multiplicities correctly.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Update `dup_sqf_list_include`**:
   - **Location**: `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`
   - **Function**: `dup_sqf_list_include(f, K, all=False)`
   - **Step**:
     - After acquiring `coeff` and `factors`:
     - Use a dictionary to accumulate the multiplicities of identical factors.
     - Convert the dictionary back to a list of tuples before returning.

2. **Update `dmp_sqf_list_include`**:
   - **Location**: `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`
   - **Function**: `dmp_sqf_list_include(f, u, K, all=False)`
   - **Step**:
     - Similar to `dup_sqf_list_include`, use a dictionary to combine identical factors and their multiplicities after getting the factors.

By implementing these changes, `sqf_list` will produce consistent and correct outputs for polynomials with multiple identical factors, ensuring that the output accurately reflects the polynomials' structure.
