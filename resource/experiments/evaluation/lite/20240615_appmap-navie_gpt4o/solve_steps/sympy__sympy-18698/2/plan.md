### Standardize `sqf` and `sqf_list` Multiplicity Output

#### Problem
The functions `sqf` and `sqf_list` produce inconsistent results regarding the multiplicity of factors. Specifically, the `sqf_list` function returns two factors with the same multiplicity, which should instead be combined into a single factor with the correct multiplicity.

#### Analysis
The root cause appears to be that the `sqf_list` function, when dealing with polynomials, does not correctly aggregate factors of the same base polynomial that have the same multiplicity in the final output list. This causes multiple entries for factors that should be combined.

To resolve this issue, we need to update the functions to check the list of factors and merge those that are identical with the same multiplicity. This will ensure the function's output is consistent and correctly represents the polynomial's structure.

#### Proposed Changes

1. **Ensure Proper Aggregation of Multiplicities in `sqf_list`:**

    - File: `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`
    - Function: `dup_sqf_list`
    - Change: Post-process the list of factors to combine any factors with identical base polynomials.

2. **Ensure Aggregation in `dmp_sqf_list` to Maintain Consistency:**

    - File: `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`
    - Function: `dmp_sqf_list`
    - Change: Similar to `dup_sqf_list`, post-process the list of factors to combine those with identical base polynomials.

Here's what needs to be done in detail:

**1. `dup_sqf_list` and `dmp_sqf_list` Aggregation**

- After obtaining the factors, create a dictionary to keep track of each base polynomial and its aggregated multiplicity.
- Traverse through the list of factors and update the dictionary.
- Finally, convert the dictionary back into a list of tuples to return the aggregated result.

#### Implementation Steps

1. **Modify `dup_sqf_list` Function:**

In the `dup_sqf_list` function located in `sympy/polys/sqfreetools.py`, add post-processing to aggregate factors with the same polynomial and multiplicity.



2. **Modify `dmp_sqf_list` Function:**

Similarly, adjust the `dmp_sqf_list` function to aggregate factors correctly.



These changes will ensure that all factors of the same polynomial are aggregated correctly, providing consistent and accurate output from both `dup_sqf_list` and `dmp_sqf_list` functions.
