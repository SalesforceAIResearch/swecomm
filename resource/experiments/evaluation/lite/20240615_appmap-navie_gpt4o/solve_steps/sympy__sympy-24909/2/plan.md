**Title**: Fix Bug with Incorrectly Evaluating Prefixed Units

**Problem**: 
When multiplying the `milli` prefix with a unit such as Watt (`W`), it evaluates to 1 instead of the expected `milliWatt` or `mW`. This issue also occurs with other prefixes and units.

**Analysis**:
The problem arises from the multiplication operation within the `Prefix` class. When `milli` is multiplied by a `Quantity`, the expected behavior is to return a new `Quantity` with the combined name and correct scale factor. However, the current implementation returns 1 for certain cases due to incorrect handling of the scale factors and the associated `Quantity`.

Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:
1. The current implementation of `__mul__` in `Prefix` class includes logic to return `1` if the combined scale factor is `1`, which is not correct for cases like `milli * W`.
2. Instead, it should always compute the new quantity correctly as long as the operands are a prefix and a `Quantity`.

**Proposed Changes**:
The file to be modified is `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`.

1. **Modify Prefix Multiplication Logic**:
    - Update the `__mul__` method in the `Prefix` class to correctly handle the scenario when a `Prefix` is multiplied by a `Quantity`.
    - Remove or adjust the condition where it returns `1` if `fact == 1` to correctly handle prefix and unit multiplication.

Specifically, locate the `__mul__` method in the `Prefix` class and update the logic as follows:
    - Ensure that when multiplying a `Prefix` with a `Quantity`, the returned object is a new `Quantity` that combines the prefix name with the unit name and correctly applies the scale factor.

Here's a detailed description of the necessary changes:

- Modify `__mul__` method in `Prefix` class in `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`:

  - Correct the multiplication logic that currently causes the issue.
  - Ensure that scale factor multiplication is handled correctly.

---

After these changes, the multiplication of `milli` with `W` should correctly evaluate to `milliWatt` or `mW` instead of `1`.

**Changes:**

- **File**: `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`
  - Locate the `__mul__` method and ensure the following:
    - If the instance (`self`) and the operand (`other`) are a `Prefix` and a `Quantity` respectively, correctly generate a new `Quantity` with the combined name and updated scale factor.
    - Ensure the scale factor logic correctly computes the resultant scale factor without returning incorrect results like `1`.

Ensure to test the multiplication with various prefixes (`milli`, `kilo`, etc.) and units (`Watt`, `Volt`, etc.) to verify correctness after changes.
