**Title**: Fix Multiplication of Unit Prefix `milli` with Units Like `Watt` and `Volt`

**Problem**: Multiplication of the unit prefix `milli` with certain units (exactly `Watt` and `Volt` observed) evaluates incorrectly to the number `1`, rather than the expected result which should retain the unit structure (e.g., `milli*W` should evaluate to `mW` or `milliwatts`).

**Analysis**:

* **Root Cause**:
  The issue arises due to the way unit prefixes are handled during the multiplication operation. Specifically, the representation of the `milli` prefix when multiplied by `Watt` is not correctly producing a new `Quantity` that represents milliwatts.

* **Effect**:
  Users attempting to use prefixes to scale units see incorrect evaluations, leading to potentially hidden errors in calculations or misunderstood results.

* **Required Change**:
  Update the logic for the multiplication of prefixes with units such that it correctly produces a new unit with the appropriate scale factor.

**Proposed Changes**:

_modifications in `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`_:
1. **Method In `prefix_unit` Implementation**:
   * Modify the behavior of the `prefix`. Specifically, ensure the multiplication of a `Prefix` with another `Quantity` correctly constructs and returns a new `Quantity` object representing the prefixed unit.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Update the `Prefix` class to handle multiplication correctly**:
   Verify existing class methods in the `Prefix` class and ensure they appropriately handle arithmetic operations when combined with instances of the `Quantity` class.

2. **Modify the `prefix_unit` function**:
   Ensure the function in `prefixes.py` handling the creation of prefixed units correctly constructs `Quantity` objects with right dimensional equivalences and scale factors.

**File to Be Modified**: `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`

### Insert or Update the Following Logic:

* Adjust the constructor or methods of the `Prefix` class to properly encapsulate the multiplication logic.
* Ensure that when a `Prefix` instance multiplies a `Quantity`, the result is a new `Quantity` with a modified name, abbreviation, and scale factor.

**Example Update**:
- Check if `prefix_unit` and other prefix handling functions correctly apply the prefix scale factors and create new units when multiplied.
- Ensure `Prefix` class encapsulates comprehensive unit handling, i.e., `__mul__`, `__rmul__`, and possibly `__call__` if it's creating prefixed units explicitly.

These changes will ensure that unit multiplication reflects the integration of prefixes correctly:



**Conclusion**:
By making these changes, multiplication operations involving unit prefixes will correctly produce the intended prefixed units (e.g., `milli*W` will yield `milliwatt`). This ensures calculations and representations involving unit prefixes are accurate and consistent.
