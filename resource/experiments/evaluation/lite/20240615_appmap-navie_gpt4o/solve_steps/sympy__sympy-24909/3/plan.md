### Title:
Correct handling of multiplication and division for `Prefix` with `Quantity`

### Problem:
`milli*W` evaluates to `1` instead of interpreting `milli` as a prefix to `W` (Watts). The class `Prefix` and its methods (`__mul__` and `__truediv__`) don't correctly recognize and handle the combination of a prefix with a quantity, leading to incorrect results when using them.

### Analysis:
The issue stems from the multiplication logic within the `Prefix` class in `prefixes.py`. The methods `__mul__` and `__truediv__` are supposed to correctly apply the prefix scaling factor to the units, but they are not currently implementing this functionality properly. As a result, when multiplying or dividing a prefix by a unit, the code incorrectly resolves it to 1 or an incorrect expression.

**Root Cause:**
- The methods `__mul__` and `__truediv__` in `Prefix` need adjustment to handle `Quantity` correctly.

**What Should Happen:**
- When a prefix like `milli` is multiplied with a unit such as `W`, it should create a new `Quantity` that has the prefix applied, resulting in `milliwatts` or `mW`.

### Proposed Changes:
The modifications need to be made in the file `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`. Specifically, the `__mul__` and `__truediv__` methods in the `Prefix` class need to be updated to process `Quantity` correctly.

1. **Adjust `__mul__` method in `Prefix` class (prefixes.py)**:
   - Ensure that when `Prefix` is multiplied by a `Quantity`, it should create and return a new `Quantity` with the prefix applied: 
   
   - In `__mul__`, after checking if `other` is of type `Quantity`, create a new `Quantity` with the appropriate name, abbreviation, and scale factor adjusting the original `Quantity`.

2. **Adjust `__truediv__` method in `Prefix` class (prefixes.py)**:
   - Ensure similar logic as multiplication but for division of `Quantity` by `Prefix`.

### Changes Details:

1. **File: `sympy/physics/units/prefixes.py`**

    **Method: `__mul__`**
    - Check if `other` is an instance of `Quantity`. If true, create a new `Quantity` that incorporates the prefix. Adjust the name, abbreviation, and scale factor accordingly.

    **Method: `__truediv__`**
    - Similar to `__mul__`, make appropriate checks and create a new `Quantity` with adjusted properties.

### Example Plan Modifications:
In the `__mul__` method, locate the section where handling of multiplication with `Quantity` and another `Prefix` is checked. Instead of returning the scaling factor, generate a new `Quantity`. Ensure similar adjustments in the `__truediv__` method to correctly process division involving `Quantity`.

By addressing these changes, the multiplication and division involving `Prefix` and `Quantity` will reflect the correct physical quantities and units, maintaining the semantic meaning of the prefixes.
