**Title:** Modify `matplotlib` to Emit 'xlim_changed' on Shared Axes

**Problem:**
Callbacks registered for the "xlim_changed" event do not trigger when the x-axis limits (`xlim`) of a shared axis are changed. This is because the `emit` flag is set to `False` when the change is induced via a shared axis. Thus, any registered callbacks are not called, leading to inconsistent behavior in applications that rely on "xlim_changed" events.

**Analysis**
The core issue is due to the use of the `emit` flag in the `set_xlim` method. When the `xlim` is updated for a shared axis, the `emit` flag is set to `False` for sibling axes to prevent recursive event emission. However, this also prevents registered callbacks from being triggered, which are intended to react to changes in the axis limits.

The recursive issue arises if `emit` is blindly set to `True` for sibling axes, leading to infinite recursion as the sibling axes keep triggering each otherâ€™s events. The solution lies in ensuring that events are processed correctly for both the originating axis with `emit=True` and other siblings with `emit=False`.

**Proposed Changes**
The following changes should be made within `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` to ensure "xlim_changed" events are properly emitted for shared axes:

1. **Method:** `set_xlim(...)`
2. **Change:** 
   - Before iterating over the sibling axes, cache whether the original axis had `emit` set to `True`.
   - Set `emit` to `False` for siblings, but process the callbacks regardless of the `emit` flag for the originating axis.
   - Move the `self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)` call outside the `if emit:` block, and ensure it's called for the originating axis.

**File:** `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`

**Detailed Changes:**
1. Locate the `set_xlim` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`.
2. Modify the method to process the 'xlim_changed' event for the original axis regardless of the `emit` flag, but still prevent it from emitting recursively for siblings.

Specific location and changes to be made:



With these changes, the "xlim_changed" event will be emitted correctly even for shared axes, ensuring that all registered callbacks are triggered appropriately without causing recursion issues.

After making these changes, conduct comprehensive testing to ensure there are no unexpected behaviors introduced. This includes testing scenarios with multiple shared axes, ensuring no recursive emissions occur, and verifying that all relevant callbacks are triggered as expected.
