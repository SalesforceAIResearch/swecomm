### Title
Fix 'xlim_changed' Callback Emission on Shared Axis in `set_xlim`

### Problem
When an axis is shared with another using the `sharex` parameter, the registered "xlim_changed" callbacks do not get called when the change is induced by the sibling axis. This is due to the `set_xlim` method setting `emit=False` for sibling axes, which prevents the emission of the "xlim_changed" event.

### Analysis
The root of the problem lies in the `set_xlim` method in `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`. When the `set_xlim` method is called, it has an `emit` parameter controlling whether events should be triggered. In its current implementation, the emission of the "xlim_changed" event is conditioned on `emit`, which is set to `False` when updating sibling axes. This design prevents the propagation of the "xlim_changed" event to other axes that share the x-axis.

To correct this, the event propagation logic needs to distinguish between triggering callbacks and updating the view limits of sibling axes. Specifically, the callbacks should be triggered even when `emit` is `False` for setting sibling axes' limits. 

### Proposed Changes
#### File: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`

1. **Update `set_xlim` method**:
   - Modify the logic where the "xlim_changed" event is processed, such that the event is always triggered for the current axis but the view limit updates for sibling axes continue without recursion issues.

#### Detailed Description of Changes
1. **Locate the `set_xlim` Method**:
   - Identify the position of the `set_xlim` method implementation in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` file.

2. **Modify Event Emission**:
   - Refactor the method to move the `self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)` call outside of the `if emit:` block.
   - Ensure that after updating the view limits of sibling axes, the "xlim_changed" event is always emitted for the current axis to notify listeners about the axis limit change.

### Proposed Code Modifications

**File: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`**
1. Modify the `set_xlim` method:

   - **Before**:
     

   - **After**:
     

By making these changes, the `xlim_changed` event will propagate correctly to listeners when axis limits are changed, even if those changes are made by a sibling axis. This correction ensures that the system's event-driven behavior remains consistent and reliable.
