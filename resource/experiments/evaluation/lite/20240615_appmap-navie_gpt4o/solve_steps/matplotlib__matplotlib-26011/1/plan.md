**Title**: Fix xlim_changed Not Emitted on Shared Axis

**Problem**:
When an axis in Matplotlib is shared with another (through `sharex=`), the registered "xlim_changed" callbacks do not get triggered when the change is induced by the shared axis. This is because the `set_xlim` function for sibling axes is called with `emit=False`.

**Analysis**:
1. **Root Cause**:
   The issue lies in the `set_xlim` function within `_base.py`, where the x-limit change for sibling axes is called with `emit=False`. This prevents the "xlim_changed" callbacks from being triggered for the shared axes.
   
2. **Implications**:
   - Changing x-limits in one axis should reflect the changes on the shared axes. However, the subsequent xlim change does not trigger the "xlim_changed" callbacks on the shared axes due to the `emit=False` parameter.
   - Moving the callback outside of the `if emit:` check ensures that the "xlim_changed" callbacks are triggered appropriately, but directly setting `emit=True` resulted in recursion issues.

3. **Logic Change**:
   - Ensure that the "xlim_changed" callback is called once after all the shared axes have adjusted their x-limits.
   - Avoid recursion by maintaining the `emit=False` while setting x-limits in sibling axes but ensuring the callback is processed after the loop.

**Proposed Changes**:
Update the `set_xlim` function in the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` file to move the callback outside the `if emit:` block. This ensures the callback is always processed even if `emit=False` is used for setting sibling axes.

**Steps**:
1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`
   
2. **Function**: `set_xlim`

3. **Modification**:
   - Add a flag to ensure the callback is processed once all the shared axes have been updated.
   - Move the callback processing outside of the `if emit:` check but ensure it's only called once per change.

### Example Pseudocode:


**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Identify the Location**:
   - Navigate to the file: `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`
   - Locate the `set_xlim` function.

2. **Update Logic**:
   - Introduce a flag (`limit_changed_callback_needed`) to track whether any axis limit changes were made.
   - Set this flag in the loop that updates sibling axes (even though `emit` is `False` there).
   - Process the 'xlim_changed' callback only once after the loop to ensure itâ€™s not recursively called.

This ensures the "xlim_changed" callbacks are appropriately triggered while avoiding recursion issues.
