**Title**: Modify EnumSerializer to Support Serialization of Combined Enum Flags

**Problem**: 
When creating migrations for models using combined enum flags (e.g., `re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE`), the serializer produces an incorrect default value (`default=re.RegexFlag[None]`). This issue arises because the current implementation of the EnumSerializer attempts to serialize combined flag values by their `.name`, which fails if there isn't a single name for the given value.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the problem lies in the serialization logic for enum fields. Specifically, when an enum flag combination is encountered that doesnâ€™t map directly to a single named value in the enum, the serializer cannot find a `.name` and defaults to an invalid representation (`None` in this case).

To address this, the serialization logic needs modification to handle combined enum flags. The standard way to decompose such values is to use `enum._decompose`, which can break down the combined flag value into its constituent named flags. By utilizing this decomposition, we can reconstruct the combined value in a valid format for serialization (e.g., using bitwise OR operations).

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`
   - **Function to Modify**: Consider or implement a serializer handling logic for enum fields.
   - **Modification**: Modify the serialization logic in the appropriate serializer class (e.g., `EnumSerializer`) to:
     1. Check if the enum value is a composite flag.
     2. Use `enum._decompose` to break down the combined flag value into its constituent named flags.
     3. Construct a serialized expression that represents the combined flag value using bitwise OR operations on the decomposed names.

**Detailed Steps**:
1. **Identify the Serializer Class for Enums**:
   Locate the class responsible for serializing enum fields (likely `EnumSerializer`) in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`.

2. **Check for Combined Flags**:
   In the method where enum fields are serialized, add logic to check if the value is a combination of flags that doesn't directly map to a single enum member's `.name`.

3. **Decompose Combined Flags**:
   If the value is a combination of flags, utilize `enum._decompose` to obtain the list of constituent named flags.

4. **Construct the Serialized Expression**:
   Create a string that represents the original combined flag value using the constituent names joined by bitwise OR operators (`|`). For example, if the combined value is `re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE`, the resulting string should be `re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE`.

5. **Return the Correct Representation**:
   Ensure the final serialized string correctly represents the original combined flag value and can be accurately deserialized back into the same enum combination.

By making these changes, the migration system will correctly serialize and deserialize fields with combined enum flags, maintaining the intended default values without errors.
