**Title**: Handle Serialization of Combined Enum Flags in Django Migrations

**Problem**: When working with combined Enum flags (like `re.UNICODE | re.IGNORECASE`) in Django models, migrations generate incorrect default values (e.g., `default=re.RegexFlag[None]`). This is due to the EnumSerializer targeting the `.name` attribute. If no single enum item corresponds to the combined value, it resorts to using an incorrect placeholder. We need to decompose the combined value into individual flags and construct the correct representation.

**Analysis**: The issue is rooted in the serialization process for Enum fields in Django migrations. When an integer field with a combined enum value is serialized, and there is no direct match in the Enum, the current logic fails to correctly resolve the value. By utilizing `enum._decompose`, we can break down the combined value into its constituent enum flags and then use these to reconstruct the combined value correctly.

To fix this, we'll need to:
1. Analyze the value during the serialization process.
2. Check if it directly matches an enum member.
3. If it does not, use `enum._decompose` to break it down into individual members.
4. Reconstruct the proper representation string for serialization by "ORing" the enum members together.

**Proposed Changes**: Focus on modifying the serialization logic within `django/db/migrations/utils.py` to handle combined Enum flags properly.

1. **Update `django/db/migrations/utils.py`:**
   - Identify where the EnumSerializer handles the `.name` attribute.
   - Introduce logic to check if the enum value is a combination of flags and decompose it using `enum._decompose`.
   - Construct the proper representation for the combined enum value.

**Detailed Description of Necessary Changes**:

1. **In `utils.py`:**
   - Locate the function or method responsible for serializing the default value of fields.
   - Introduce a check to see if the value is a combined enum flag.
   - If it is, use `enum._decompose` to break down the value into individual flags.
   - Construct a string representation that "ORs" these flags together and use this string as the serialized default value.

2. **Function to Modify in `utils.py`**:
   - Find the section where `RegexFlag` or any other enum is serialized.
   - Modify the `EnumSerializer` to handle decomposing composite enum values.
   - Ensure that the new representation is correctly formatted to be used in migrations.

By focusing changes solely on the serialization logic in `utils.py`, we ensure minimal disruption to other parts of the codebase while correctly addressing the problem of combined enum flag serialization in migrations.
