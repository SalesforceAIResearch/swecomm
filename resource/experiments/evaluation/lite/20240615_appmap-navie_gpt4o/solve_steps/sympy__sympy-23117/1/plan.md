**Title: Fix Handling of Empty Arrays in `sympy.Array` Initialization**

**Problem**
Currently, trying to create an empty `Array` (e.g., `Array([])`) in SymPy 1.4 leads to a `ValueError` because the internal method `_scan_iterable_shape` expects at least one element to unpack. In contrast, `Matrix([])` works correctly. The inconsistency between the handling of empty arrays for `Array` and `Matrix` suggests an issue that needs to be addressed to unify behavior.

**Analysis**
Upon attempting to initialize an empty `Array`, the execution flow reaches the `_scan_iterable_shape` method, which fails due to the absence of elements to unpack. The primary method `_scan_iterable_shape` is built to work with non-empty iterables, leading to this issue. The goal is to handle empty iterables gracefully within the `Array` initialization workflows, similar to how `Matrix` handles it. To achieve this, we need to modify the `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` method and potentially the `_scan_iterable_shape` method to account for cases where the input iterable is empty.

**Proposed Changes**
1. Modify the `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` method in `ndim_array.py`:
   - Ensure that it can process empty iterables without proceeding to `scan_iterable_shape`.
   - Handle the default case of setting shape to an empty tuple when the input iterable is empty.

2. Adjust the `__new__` method and `_new` method of `DenseNDimArray` and `ImmutableDenseNDimArray`:
   - Ensure these methods invoke `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` appropriately.
   - Update these methods to handle the scenario where the result from `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` indicates an empty array.

**Proposed File Changes**

`File: sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py`
- Modify the `_handle_ndarray_creation_inputs` method at lines 212-258:
  - Add a check for an empty iterable before calling `_scan_iterable_shape`.
  - If the iterable is empty, set `shape` to `()` and `iterable` to `()`, and return these values directly.
  - Adjust the `_scan_iterable_shape` method to handle cases where `iterable` is empty.

`File: sympy/tensor/array/dense_ndim_array.py`
- Modify the `__new__` method of `ImmutableDenseNDimArray` at lines 131-157.
  - Ensure that it processes the empty iterable scenario appropriately.
- Modify the `__new__` method of `MutableDenseNDimArray` at lines 163-190.
  - Ensure that it processes the empty iterable scenario appropriately.

After these changes, the system should correctly initialize an empty `Array`, making the behavior of `Array` consistent with that of `Matrix`. This modification should prevent the `ValueError` and allow for seamless initialization of empty arrays in SymPy.
