**Title**: Fix duplication of *args and **kwargs in autodoc_typehints descriptions

**Problem**: When using Sphinx's autodoc extension with the `autodoc_typehints` setting set to "description," *args and **kwargs parameters are being duplicated and rendered incompletely in the generated documentation.

**Analysis**:
The described problem indicates that *args and **kwargs are appearing twice in the generated documentation, once without proper formatting and once with. The logic handling the processing of type hints and parameters in the `autodoc_typehints` module is likely missing checks or has redundant code that causes these duplications.

The key functions for handling this task in the `sphinx/ext/autodoc` module include `record_typehints` and `merge_typehints`. The issue is likely that these functions or their corresponding helper functions do not correctly handle *args and **kwargs when merging type hints into the function/method signatures.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`
   - **Function**: `record_typehints` at lines 15-34 and `merge_typehints` at lines 37-58.
   - **Change**: Implement checks to prevent adding *args and **kwargs multiple times.
     - Inside the function `record_typehints`, modify the logic to exclude *args and **kwargs from the parameter list if they have already been processed.
     - Similarly, ensure that the `merge_typehints` function processes parameters only once and does not append redundant entries for *args and **kwargs.
   
2. Specifically, modify the `record_typehints` function:
   - Add a set to track parameters already processed.
   - Check if *args or **kwargs are already in the set before adding them again.
   
3. Adjust `merge_typehints` function:
   - Ensure that *args and **kwargs are represented correctly and not duplicated by verifying they aren't already appended to the list of processed parameters. If they are already present, skip re-adding them.

4. **File**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`
   - **Line**: 169-198
   - **Change**: This section of the code applies formatting to parameters with and without types in their descriptions. Ensure enhancements are made to check for *args and **kwargs and format them correctly without duplication.

These changes should address the duplication issue while ensuring that documentation is rendered correctly in the described format.
