**Title**: Fix duplicated *args and **kwargs parameters in formatted autodoc typehints

**Problem**: 
When using the `autodoc` extension and the setting `autodoc_typehints = "description"`, the generated documentation for class methods with `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters contains duplicate and incomplete entries. This is especially evident in methods with explicitly documented `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters which get incorrectly duplicated in the final rendered output.

**Analysis**:
The duplication occurs due to the way type hints are merged and formatted in the extension. When processing docstrings and type annotations, it appears that the existing logic for appending parameters to the documentation does not handle `*args` and `**kwargs` correctly, leading to these elements being added multiple times. Hence, it is essential to ensure that such parameters are appended only once and with the correct formatting.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`**:
    - Modify the logic in functions that merge and display type hints to handle `*args` and `**kwargs` specifically.
    - Ensure `*args` and `**kwargs` are appended only once in the formatted output and only when no explicit documentation for these parameters exists.

   Suggested areas of modification:
   
   A. **Function `merge_typehints`**:
   - Ensure that duplicate entries for `*args` and `**kwargs` are prevented in the output.
   - Modify merging logic for `field_lists` to handle star arguments properly.
   
   B. **Function `record_typehints`**:
   - Refine handling and stringification to ensure that `*args` and `**kwargs` are documented correctly without duplicates.

   C. **Function `modify_field_list`** (if exists or needs to be created):
   - Modify this helper function (or create one) to ensure star arguments are represented correctly and merged into the documentation parameters list properly.

**Details of the changes**:

A. **In `merge_typehints` function**:
   - Check and remove any duplicate entries for `*args` and `**kwargs` from the `field_lists` before appending them.
   - Ensure that once an entry for these parameters is appended, no further entries are added.

B. **In `record_typehints` function**:
   - Precisely identify `*args` and `**kwargs` and handle their string representation appropriately to avoid duplication.
   - Ensure the parameter dict maintains a single entry for `*args` and `**kwargs`.

In summary, the proposed changes will involve adjusting the logic for merging and displaying docstring parameters in type hints to handle star arguments (`*args`, `**kwargs`) correctly. This will ensure that these parameters are not duplicated in the formatted autodoc output, resulting in a cleaner, more accurate documentation.

By applying these changes, the documentation for class methods with `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters should no longer have the issue of duplicated entries and should display the expected output as outlined in the problem statement.
