**Title**: Fix duplicated *args and **kwargs in autodoc type hints generation

**Problem**: When using the autodoc extension with the setting `autodoc_typehints = "description"`, the documentation for functions including `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters is duplicated. This results in redundant and incomplete entries in the generated documentation.

**Analysis**: The issue arises because the code responsible for handling the type hints and function signatures does not properly account for the uniqueness of `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters. Instead, it processes these parameters multiple times, leading to duplicated entries in the generated documentation.

**Proposed Changes**: Modify the logic responsible for processing type hints so that `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters are handled correctly and only once. The changes will be focused on ensuring that type hints are merged and processed without duplication. 

**Changes to be made in**: `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`

1. **Function**: `merge_typehints`
   - **Update**: Modify the function to keep a track of `*args` and `**kwargs` and ensure they are not processed more than once.
   - **Modification Details**:
     - Use a set to keep track of already processed parameters.
     - Before adding a parameter to the result, check if it has already been added.

2. **Function**: `record_typehints`
   - **Update**: Ensure that when recording type hints, the variables `*args` and `**kwargs` are checked so that they are not recorded twice.
   - **Modification Details**:
     - Similar to the `merge_typehints` function, use a set to manage encountered `*args` and `**kwargs`.

Suggested changes:

- Inside the `merge_typehints` function:
  - Introduce a set to store the names of parameters that have been processed.
  - Before appending a parameter, check if its name is in the set.
  - If not, process and add it to the set.

- Inside the `record_typehints` function:
  - Adapt it so that while iterating through `sig.parameters` values, it checks whether the parameter is a `*args` or `**kwargs`.
  - Prevent duplicate processing by using a set, as above, and ensuring `*args` and `**kwargs` are only recorded once.

These modifications will ensure that the `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters are not duplicated in the generated documentation.
