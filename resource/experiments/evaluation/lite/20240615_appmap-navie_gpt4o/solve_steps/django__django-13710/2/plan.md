**Title**: Use Inline Admin verbose_name as default for Inline verbose_name_plural

**Problem**: 
In Django admin views, when specifying an Inline class, the `verbose_name_plural` is not automatically derived from the `verbose_name` if provided. Instead, it defaults to the plural name of the model, which is inconsistent with the behavior of a model's `Meta` class where `verbose_name_plural` is derived from `verbose_name` by adding an 's'.

**Analysis**: 
In Django's admin system, Inlines are used to display related models within the admin interface. Currently, when defining an Inline model, the `verbose_name_plural` is always derived from the model's name or the plural name specified in the model's `Meta` class, even if a `verbose_name` is provided in the Inline class. This behavior can be confusing and seems inconsistent with Django’s handling of `verbose_name_plural` in the model’s `Meta` class.

To address this, we need to enhance the Inline model so that if `verbose_name` is specified and `verbose_name_plural` is not provided, `verbose_name_plural` should default to the plural form of `verbose_name`.

**Proposed Changes**:
The changes should be made in the `GenericInlineModelAdmin` which is located in `django/contrib/contenttypes/admin.py`.

1. **Modify `GenericInlineModelAdmin` class initialization**:
    - Implement logic within the `__init__` method of the `GenericInlineModelAdmin` to check if `verbose_name` is specified and `verbose_name_plural` is not. If so, derive `verbose_name_plural` from `verbose_name`.

    Specific steps:
    - Check if `verbose_name` is provided.
    - If `verbose_name` is provided and `verbose_name_plural` is not, default `verbose_name_plural` to the plural form of `verbose_name` by adding 's'.

Details on the specific changes in the file:

**File**: `django/contrib/contenttypes/admin.py`
1. Update the `GenericInlineModelAdmin.__init__` method:
   - Inside the `__init__` method, after initializing `verbose_name`, add a conditional check:
     - If `verbose_name` is specified and `verbose_name_plural` is not specified, set `verbose_name_plural` to the plural form of `verbose_name` by adding 's'.

With these changes, the Django admin will by default derive `verbose_name_plural` from the `verbose_name` if only `verbose_name` is specified in the Inline class, enhancing consistency and reducing potential user confusion.
