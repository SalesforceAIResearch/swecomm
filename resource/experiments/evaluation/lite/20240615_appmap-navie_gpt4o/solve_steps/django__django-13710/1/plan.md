**Title**: Base Inline `verbose_name_plural` on `verbose_name` if not explicitly specified

**Problem**: 

In the Django Admin interface, when defining Inline classes, specifying a `verbose_name` does not automatically infer a `verbose_name_plural`. Instead, `verbose_name_plural` is inferred from the model name or the `verbose_name` specified in the model's Meta class. This requires users to manually set both `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` when overriding the default names, which is inconsistent with how modelsâ€™ Meta classes work (where `verbose_name_plural` is automatically based on `verbose_name`).

**Analysis**:

The inconsistency arises from the absence of a default inferring mechanism for `verbose_name_plural` in Inline classes when a `verbose_name` is specified. The solution should ensure that if `verbose_name_plural` is not explicitly set, it defaults to the plural form derived from `verbose_name`.

To implement this, we need to:

1. Identify where the `verbose_name_plural` is set for Inline classes.
2. Modify logic such that `verbose_name_plural` is inferred from `verbose_name` if not explicitly provided.
3. Maintain backward compatibility by only applying this new default behavior when `verbose_name_plural` is not set.

**Proposed Changes**:

Modify the `GenericInlineModelAdmin` class in the file `django/contrib/contenttypes/admin.py`.

1. **File**: `django/contrib/contenttypes/admin.py`
    - **Function to Modify**: The `__init__` method or wherever the verbose names are set for Inline classes.
    - **Logic Change**:
        - Check if `verbose_name_plural` is set. If not, infer it from `verbose_name` by appending an 's' or using any existing pluralization logic.

Proposed Changes in Detail:

1. **File**: `django/contrib/contenttypes/admin.py`

    - Locate the section where `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are handled in `GenericInlineModelAdmin` class.

    - Add logic to infer `verbose_name_plural` from `verbose_name`:
        - Modify the class to check if `verbose_name_plural` is not explicitly set.
        - If not, set `verbose_name_plural` based on the `verbose_name`.

    Example of such a logic change:
    - Inside the `GenericInlineModelAdmin` class or its methods:

        

3. Validate the approach and ensure backward compatibility by ensuring existing behavior is maintained if both `verbose_name` and `verbose_name_plural` are specified.

With these changes, users will benefit from a more intuitive and consistent behavior in the Django Admin interface, simplifying the configuration of Inline classes.
