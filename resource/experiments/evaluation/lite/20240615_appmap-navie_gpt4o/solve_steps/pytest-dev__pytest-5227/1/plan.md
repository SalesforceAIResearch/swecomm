**Title**: Update Default Log Format to Include Module Name

**Problem**: The current default logging format only includes the base filename, line number, log level, and message, which can be insufficient for detailed logging. Including the module name (`name`) will provide more context and make the logs more informative.

**Analysis**: The default logging format is defined by the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` constant. To enhance the logging format, we propose adding the `name` (module name) to it. This modification gives a clearer idea of where a log message originates, especially when projects have files with the same name in different directories.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. Update the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` constant to include the module name (`name`). The new format will be:
   

2. Ensure that any part of the code that uses `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` for logging utilizes the updated format.

### Detailed Steps:

#### File: `src/_pytest/logging.py`
- Locate the definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and update its value.

  **Before:**
  

  **After:**
  

3. Review the instantiation of log formatters in the file. Ensure that the altered `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is applied wherever the log format is set using this constant.

- Example locations to review and possibly adjust if constants are used:
  - Lines setting formats for handlers or streamers, such as:
    

4. Test your changes to ensure that the new logging format is fully integrated and logs are being generated as expected with the enhanced details.

By updating `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and ensuring its usage globally in the logger's configuration, the logs will contain more descriptive information, greatly improving their utility for debugging and analysis.
