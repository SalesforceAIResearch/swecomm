**Title**: Update Default Logging Format to Include Module Name and File Name

**Problem**: 
The current default logging format uses only the base filename, missing potentially useful context like the module name. The current format:

is not as informative as it could be. An improved format would include the module name and file name, offering more precise information about log sources:

The user also suggested potentially including the relative path but acknowledged it could be too long. 

**Analysis**: 
The `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is a global setting used by the logging configuration. Adjusting this format to include both `name` (module name) and `filename` will improve log readability and traceability. 

The `name` attribute in logging refers to the name of the logger used, which by convention is the module name. Including this alongside the filename and line number will give a clearer context about the source of each log message.

**Proposed Changes**:
To incorporate these improvements, we need to locate the definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and update it accordingly. Specifically:

1. **File**: `src/_pytest/logging.py`
   - **Change**: Update the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` string to include `%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s`.

**Details of Changes**:

1. **File: `src/_pytest/logging.py`**:
   - Locate the line defining `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`:
     
   - Update it to:
     
   
By updating the format string as described, the log messages will now include the module name along with the filename and line number, significantly enhancing the log's informational quality without adding too much verbosity.
