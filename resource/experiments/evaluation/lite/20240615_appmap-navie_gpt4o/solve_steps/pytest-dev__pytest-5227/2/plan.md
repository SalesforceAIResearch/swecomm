**Title**: Update DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT to Include Module Name and Adjust Format

**Problem**:
The current `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in the logging settings only includes the filename, line number, log level, and message. This makes it difficult to quickly understand the context of log messages, especially in larger projects where filenames might be repeated. Including the module name (as `name`) and adjusting the format for clarity would provide more useful information to developers.

**Analysis**:
- The current `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` is: `%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s`
- This format does not include the module name, making it hard to identify the source of the log entry.
- The suggested new format is: `%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s`
    - This includes the log level, the module name (`name`), the filename, the line number, and the log message.
    - It provides more context by specifying the module and file, along with the line number directly after the file information.

**Proposed Changes**:
**File to change**: `src/_pytest/logging.py`

1. Locate the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` constant definition:
    - Update the definition of `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` on or around line 11 to:
      
2. Review the file for any references to `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` to ensure compatibility with the new format.
    - Ensure that the modules and test configurations are adapted where required so that the `name` field is available and correctly interpreted by the formatters.

This change will provide more context in log outputs, making it easier to trace log messages back to their source modules and files within the project. This will be particularly beneficial during debugging and in environments where logs are extensively analyzed for performance and error tracking.
