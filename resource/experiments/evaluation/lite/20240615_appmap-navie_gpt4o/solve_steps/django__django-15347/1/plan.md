**Title**: Fix empty `extra_tags` serialization in MessageEncoder and MessageDecoder

**Problem**: When a message in Django's messages framework is serialized and then deserialized, an empty string `extra_tags` gets converted into `None`. This happens because the `MessageEncoder` checks for the truthiness of `extra_tags` rather than checking if it is not `None`.

**Analysis**: The issue arises because the `MessageEncoder` does not distinguish between `extra_tags` being an empty string and `None`. During serialization, if `extra_tags` is empty, it is not encoded, leading to the `MessageDecoder` treating it as `None` when deserializing. This can create inconsistencies, particularly when conditional logic in templates depends on `extra_tags`.

To fix this, we should:
1. Ensure that `MessageEncoder` includes `extra_tags` in the serialized output even if it's an empty string.
2. Adjust `MessageDecoder` to correctly interpret the empty string `extra_tags` during deserialization.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **Modification in `MessageEncoder` (located in `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`):**
    - Update the `default` method in `MessageEncoder` to include `extra_tags` in the serialized output, even if `extra_tags` is an empty string.

2. **Modification in `MessageDecoder` (located in `django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py`):**
    - Update the `process_messages` method in `MessageDecoder` to handle the case where `extra_tags` is an empty string.

**Detailed File Changes**:

- **django/contrib/messages/storage/cookie.py**:
  - Locate the `default` method in the `MessageEncoder` class.
    - Update the logic to append `extra_tags` to the message list even if `extra_tags` is an empty string.
  - Locate the `process_messages` method in the `MessageDecoder` class.
    - Update the logic to correctly reconstruct the `extra_tags` as an empty string rather than setting it to `None`.

By ensuring that `extra_tags` is serialized and deserialized properly, we prevent `extra_tags` from unintentionally being converted to `None`, maintaining the integrity of message data across serialization and deserialization.
