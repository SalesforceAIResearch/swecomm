**Title**: Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()

**Problem**: 
The `flask.Config.from_file()` method doesn't support specifying file modes (text or binary), which causes issues when using loaders that require the file to be opened in binary mode, like `tomllib.load()`. This inhibits the straightforward loading of TOML configuration files in Python 3.11.

**Analysis**: 
The `flask.Config.from_file()` method currently opens files in text mode. This design limitation causes problems when trying to use loaders that require binary mode. Therefore, adding an optional file mode parameter to `from_file()` would make the method more flexible and capable of handling a broader range of file loaders.

The new parameter should default to text mode ('t') to maintain backward compatibility. Additionally, internal logic should be updated to handle file opening based on the provided mode.

Steps:
1. Add an optional parameter `mode` to the `from_file()` method signature.
2. Update the method logic to open the file in the specified mode.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `src/flask/config.py`
   - **Function**: `from_file`
   - **Location**: Around line 238 (based on the closest relevant code snippets)
   - **Changes**:
     - Modify the method signature to include the `mode` parameter.
     - Adjust the file opening logic to use the `mode` parameter.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the changes:

- Modify the method signature:
  

- Adjust the file reading logic:
  

These changes will allow the `from_file()` method to accept an optional file mode parameter, making it more flexible and suitable for loaders requiring binary mode, such as `tomllib.load()`. This will also preserve the default behavior for backward compatibility.
