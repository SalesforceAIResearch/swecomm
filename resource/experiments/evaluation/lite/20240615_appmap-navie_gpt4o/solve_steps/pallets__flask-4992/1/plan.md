**Title**: Add file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()`

**Problem**: 
`flask.Config.from_file()` opens files in text mode by default, which is incompatible with functions like `tomllib.load()` that require files to be opened in binary mode. This results in a `TypeError`. Currently, the workaround is verbose and convoluted, requiring manual file handling and path joining.

**Analysis**:
To solve this issue, we need to enhance the `flask.Config.from_file()` method to accept an optional `mode` parameter. This parameter should allow the file to be opened in either text mode (`"t"`) or binary mode (`"b"`), with text mode being the default to maintain backward compatibility. 

By adding this parameter, users will be able to specify the mode appropriate for the function they are using to load the configuration file. This will simplify code and improve usability with libraries like Python's built-in `tomllib`.

The steps are as follows:

1. **Modify the `from_file` method**: Add an optional `mode` parameter with a default value of `"t"`.
2. **Adjust the file opening logic**: Use the provided mode when opening the file.

**Proposed Changes**:
The necessary changes should be made in the `src/flask/config.py` file within the `Config` class:

1. **Update the `from_file` Method Declaration**:
   Add a `mode` parameter to the method signature.
   
   

2. **Modify the File Opening Logic**:
   Update the `open()` call within the `from_file()` method to use the specified mode.
   
   

3. **Ensure Correct Handling of OSError**: 
   Ensure it still handles errors properly for both modes.
   
   

These changes will allow users to specify the mode (text or binary) when loading configuration files, making the `from_file()` method more versatile and convenient to use with binary-read functions like `tomllib.load()`.
