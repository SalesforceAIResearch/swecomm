**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

[Bug]: Setting norm with existing colorbar fails with 3.6.3
### Bug summary

Setting the norm to a `LogNorm` after the colorbar has been created (e.g. in interactive code) fails with an `Invalid vmin` value in matplotlib 3.6.3.

The same code worked in previous matplotlib versions.

Not that vmin and vmax are explicitly set to values valid for `LogNorm` and no negative values (or values == 0) exist in the input data.

### Code for reproduction

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm
import numpy as np

# create some random data to fill a 2d plot
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
img = rng.uniform(1, 5, (25, 25))

# plot it
fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout="constrained")
plot = ax.pcolormesh(img)
cbar = fig.colorbar(plot, ax=ax)

vmin... (3703)
