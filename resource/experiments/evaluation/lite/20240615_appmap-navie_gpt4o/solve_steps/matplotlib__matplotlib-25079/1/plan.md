### Update Colorbar Norm and Mappable Synchronization

**Problem**
Setting the norm to a `LogNorm` after a colorbar has been created fails with an "Invalid vmin or vmax" error in Matplotlib 3.6.3. This same scenario works in previous Matplotlib versions, suggesting a regression or an unnoticed bug.

**Analysis**
The problem occurs because changing the norm of the plot does not automatically propagate to the existing colorbar. The `colorbar` object relies on the old norm which leads to inconsistencies between the plot norm and the colorbar norm, causing invalid vmin or vmax errors.

Here's a breakdown of the root causes and the necessary logic adjustments:

- When the norm of a plot is changed after the colorbar has been created, the colorbar should also be updated to reflect this new norm.
- The `ScalarMappable` (which `pcolormesh` returns) needs to sync its norm with the colorbar.
- We need to ensure that either:  
  1. The colorbar is recreated or,  
  2. The colorbar's norm is updated in sync with the `ScalarMappable`.

**Proposed Changes**
To resolve this issue, we'll modify the `add_figure` method in `lib/matplotlib/backend_tools.py` to include the necessary updates that synchronize the colorbar with the plot whenever norms are modified post-plot creation.

1. **File**: `lib/matplotlib/backend_tools.py`
   
   Modify the `add_figure` method to include a colorbar update mechanism. Here's the detailed change:

   - **Modification**:
     Within the `add_figure` method, add logic to update the `colorbar` norm if it exists. This ensures that any subsequent changes to the plot's norm are properly reflected in the colorbar.

   - **Modification Details**:
     - Ensure colorbar is updated or recreated with the new norm whenever `plot.norm` changes.
     - Prevent the described errors by maintaining consistency between plot and colorbar norms.

   **Detailed Steps:**
   - **Initialize**: Wrap the existing logic that initializes the figure with further checks for the colorbar norm synchronization.
   - **Colorbar Sync Check**: Check if a colorbar exists and update its norm to the new norm of the plot.

**Changes Required**:
1. **Update `add_figure` Method**:
   - `lib/matplotlib/backend_tools.py`
     Modify the function to ensure that when the plot's norm is updated, the corresponding colorbar's norm is synchronized accordingly causing updates to the visuals without raising norm-related errors.

- Check if a colorbar is present.
- If present, update the colorbar's norm to the plot's `LogNorm`.
- Rerender the plot if necessary to ensure changes are visible.

By implementing this, we ensure that whenever the `LogNorm` is updated, the colorbar seamlessly adopts the new values, preventing the errors as described. This solution maintains backward compatibility while resolving the regression observed in version 3.6.3.
