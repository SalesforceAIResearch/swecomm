To resolve the issue of norm and mappable synchronization for colorbars, we need to modify the `add_figure` method in `lib/matplotlib/backend_tools.py`. This change will ensure that any subsequent updates to a plot's norm are also applied to its associated colorbar, preventing errors related to vmin or vmax inconsistencies.

Here are the planned modifications:

1. Ensure that when adding a figure, any existing colorbars are updated to reflect changes in the norm of the plots they are associated with.
2. Add logic to re-render the figure when such updates are made.

We'll introduce the changes in the `add_figure` method as follows:

    def add_figure(self, figure):
        """Add the current figure to the stack of views and positions."""

        if figure not in self.views:
            self.views[figure] = cbook.Stack()
            self.positions[figure] = cbook.Stack()
            self.home_views[figure] = WeakKeyDictionary()
            # Define Home
            self.push_current(figure)
            # Make sure we add a home view for new axes as they're added
            figure.add_axobserver(lambda fig: self.update_home_views(fig))

        # Update colorbar norm to synchronize with plot norm
        for ax in figure.get_axes():
            for mappable in ax.collections + ax.images + ax.lines:
                if hasattr(mappable, 'colorbar'):
                    if mappable.colorbar:
                        mappable.colorbar.update_normal(mappable)
        
        figure.canvas.draw_idle()  # Ensure any changes are rendered
]]></modified>
</change>
```

This change ensures that after adding a figure, any colorbars are updated to reflect the current norms of their associated plots. By syncing the colorbar norms with the plot norms, we prevent the errors related to invalid vmin or vmax values.

**Testing the Change**

To ensure the change works correctly, we should write a test to simulate the scenario:

1. Create a plot with a specific norm.
2. Add a colorbar to the plot.
3. Change the norm of the plot.
4. Verify that the colorbar is updated without errors.

Here's a sample test case to verify this behavior.

### Test Case

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from matplotlib.colors import LogNorm

def test_colorbar_norm_sync():
    # Create data
    data = np.random.rand(10, 10)

    # Create plot with initial norm
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    cax = ax.pcolormesh(data, norm=LogNorm())
    cbar = fig.colorbar(cax)

    # Update norm
    new_norm = LogNorm(vmin=0.01, vmax=1)
    cax.set_norm(new_norm)

    # Trigger figure addition
    fig.canvas.manager.toolmanager.get_tool("_views_positions").add_figure(fig)
    
    # Check if the colorbar updated without error
    assert cbar.norm == new_norm, "Colorbar norm did not update correctly"

    plt.close(fig)

# Run the test
test_colorbar_norm_sync()
```

In this test, we create a plot with a colorbar, update the norm of the plot, and invoke the `add_figure` method to ensure that the colorbar's norm is updated correctly. The assertion ensures that the colorbar's norm matches the updated plot norm. If the norm is updated without errors, the test passes.
