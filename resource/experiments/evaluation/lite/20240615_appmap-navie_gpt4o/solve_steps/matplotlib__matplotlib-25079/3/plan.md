### Title
Fix `Invalid vmin or vmax` error when setting `LogNorm` after colorbar creation in `matplotlib.collections`

### Problem
Setting the normalization (`norm`) of a plot to `LogNorm` after a colorbar has been created causes a `ValueError` ("Invalid vmin or vmax") when using matplotlib version 3.6.3. This issue did not occur in older versions of matplotlib.

### Analysis
The error occurs due to the `LogNorm` normalization parameters (`vmin` and `vmax`) not being updated properly for the colorbar associated with the plot. While the plot updates the `norm` correctly, the associated colorbar does not get the new normalization parameters, which leads to the discrepancy and subsequently the error during rendering.

The main functionality of the `colorbar` is to map the data values to colors, based on the `ScalarMappable` object (like a plot) that it references. When the normalization of the `ScalarMappable` is changed, the colorbar needs to be re-initialized or updated to reflect these changes. However, the current implementation fails to do this effectively for `LogNorm`.

### Proposed Changes
The fix should ensure that the colorbar is properly updated when the normalization (`norm`) of the associated `ScalarMappable` object is changed. This requires checking and updating the colorbar's reference to the `ScalarMappable` object's `norm`.

1. **Modify `lib/matplotlib/collections.py`**:
   
   - Ensure that when the `ScalarMappable` object's normalization (`norm`) is changed, the associated colorbar is either re-initialized or updated with new normalization parameters.
   
   - Specifically, handle the integrity of `vmin` and `vmax` parameters to ensure they are consistent with the `LogNorm` requirements.

### Detailed changes:

1. **In `update_scalarmappable` method**:
    - Locate the method definition for `update_scalarmappable`.
    - After setting the new norm, refresh the colorbar to reflect these changes.
    - Validate the `vmin` and `vmax` values to ensure they are within the appropriate range for `LogNorm`.

2. **Update `__call__` method in `colors.py`**:
    - Ensure that the `__call__` method in `LogNorm` correctly handles cases where the new normalization parameters lead to an inconsistency, and provide a more descriptive error message or corrective action.
    
Hereâ€™s an outline for the modification:

**File: `lib/matplotlib/collections.py`**:
- Ensure the `update_scalarmappable` method updates the colorbar norm parameters:
    1. After setting the new `norm`, trigger the update on the colorbar (if it exists, refresh its min/max values).

**File: `lib/matplotlib/colors.py`**:
- Modify `LogNorm.__call__` to immune to faulty `vmin, vmax` values:
    1. Validate and adjust `vmin` and `vmax` according to logarithmic scale requirements before normalization.
    2. Raise specific errors if min/max range is invalid for logarithmic scaling.

By making these changes, the colorbar and plot should be correctly synchronized to use the new `LogNorm` parameters, thus preventing the `ValueError` and ensuring expected behavior.

By following these changes, we ensure that the colorbar reflects the changes in the mappable object properly, mitigating the `ValueError` resulting from invalid `vmin` or `vmax`.

### Conclusion
This plan addresses updating colorbar norm parameters in synchronization with `ScalarMappable` objects effectively, especially for `LogNorm`, ensuring compatibility and fixing the error in matplotlib 3.6.3.
