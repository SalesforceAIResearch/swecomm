**Title**: Correct norm setting issue with existing colorbar in Matplotlib 3.6.3

**Problem**:
When updating the `norm` property of a mappable object (such as a collection created by `ax.pcolormesh`) to `LogNorm`, after a colorbar has been created, the operation fails with a "Invalid vmin or vmax" error in Matplotlib version 3.6.3. This behavior did not occur in previous versions of Matplotlib and affects interactive plots.
  
**Analysis**:
The root of the problem lies in the update of the `norm` attribute in the mappable object. When `norm` is set to `LogNorm`, `vmin` and `vmax` must be valid positive values greater than zero. The issue seems to arise from the sequence of operations, where the mappable's array data and the associated color mapping are not immediately updated upon changing the `norm`. Instead, they require a forced update or re-application of the color mapping.

The issue can be resolved by ensuring that the color mapping is correctly updated after setting the new `norm`. Specifically, the normalization and color scaling should be explicitly recalculated.

**Proposed Changes**:
We need to update the file where the mappable's `norm` is set. The changes should enforce a re-application of the color mapping after setting the `norm`.

Edit the appropriate function in the code base where `norm` is updated. For instance, in `_pylab_helpers.py` (or the relevant module that handles the interactive update of color mapping), ensure the following:

1. **Setting the New Norm**: After setting the new `norm` attribute on the mappable object, manually trigger an update to the colormap scaling.

2. **Recalculate Color Mapping**: Explicitly call functions that recalibrate and update the data based on the new norm.

The steps involved include:
- Set the `norm` attribute on the `plot` object.
- Call the method to update the scalar mappable data to recalculate colors.
- Ensure the colorbar is updated accordingly.

**Suggested Updates in `_pylab_helpers.py` (or corresponding file)**:

1. Locate the method where `norm` is being set on the mappable object.

2. Add calls to:
   - Manually update the scalar data (`set_array` or similar method).
   - Recompute the color scaling (`autoscale`, `update_scalarmappable` or a similar method).
   - Redraw or re-render the plot if necessary.

Detailed Code Edits:

- **LOC**: The method where `norm` is set. This should be something like `set_norm` or within a context that handles color updates.

- **Function Adjustments**:
  - **Set Norm**: `plot.norm = LogNorm(vmin, vmax)`
  - **Update Scalar Mappable**:
    

- Ensure that the colorbar recalibrates to the new norm:
    

Your specific implementation may vary depending on the architecture and existing methods in the codebase, but the fundamental changes involve ensuring the color mapping and normalization are recalculated post norm update.

By applying these changes, the error concerning "Invalid vmin or vmax" will be resolved, and the plot should update its colorbar and colormap without issues.
