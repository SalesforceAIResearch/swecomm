**Title**: Ignore `empty_permitted` in form_kwargs for formset.empty_form

**Problem**: 
When explicitly setting `form_kwargs = {'empty_permitted': True}` or `form_kwargs = {'empty_permitted': False}`, a `KeyError` occurs during rendering of a template that uses a formset's `empty_form`. The `empty_permitted` attribute should be irrelevant for the `empty_form`.

**Analysis**: 
The core of the issue lies in incorrectly considering the `empty_permitted` field for an `empty_form` within a formset. The `empty_form` is not supposed to pass validated data, and hence, `empty_permitted` should not be applicable. Including it throws a `KeyError`, which can break the template rendering.

To resolve the issue, we need to ensure that the `empty_permitted` key is ignored or removed when constructing the `empty_form` from the formset.

**Proposed Changes**: 

To address the problem, modifications should be made in the file where the formset and `empty_form` are potentially combined with `form_kwargs`. Here's a detailed description of the necessary changes:

- **File to Modify**: `django/forms/formsets.py`

1. **Logic Modification**:
   - Within the `empty_form` logic, specifically check and ignore the `empty_permitted` key if it's part of `form_kwargs`.
   - This requires filtering out the `empty_permitted` field from `form_kwargs` before the `empty_form` is created and processed.

2. **Steps**:
   - Locate the part of the code where the `empty_form` is being initialized.
   - Add a logic to filter out the `empty_permitted` key if it exists in the `form_kwargs` dictionary before using it to create `empty_form`.

### Detailed Change Description:

- **Modification Point**: Look into the class responsible for managing formsets, particularly where `empty_form` is derived.

1. **Locate the Initialization of `empty_form`**:
   - Typically, this logic will be around the methods that initialize or render formsets, e.g., `_construct_form()` or similar methods.

2. **Filter `form_kwargs`**:
   - Modify the `form_kwargs` dictionary to exclude `empty_permitted` before passing it to the constructor of `empty_form`.

**Example Pseudo-Implementation**:



- **Explanation**: In the method responsible for creating the `empty_form`, adjust the `form_kwargs` dictionary by removing the `empty_permitted` key if it exists. This ensures the `empty_form` does not consider this parameter, thereby preventing the `KeyError`.

By applying these changes, the issue of `KeyError` when rendering `empty_form` with explicit `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` should be resolved.
