**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

Rendering empty_form crashes when empty_permitted is passed to form_kwargs
Description
	
Issue
When explicitly setting form_kwargs = {'empty_permitted':True} or form_kwargs = {'empty_permitted':False} , a KeyError occurs when rendering a template that uses a formset's empty_form.
Expected Behavior
empty_permitted is ignored for formset.empty_form since empty_permitted is irrelevant for empty_form, as empty_form is not meant to be used to pass data and therefore does not need to be validated.
Steps to Reproduce
# views.py
from django.shortcuts import render
from .models import MyModel
def test_view(request):
	context = {}
	ff = modelformset_factory(MyModel, fields = ['a_field'])
	context['formset'] = ff(
		queryset = MyModel.objects.none(),
		form_kwargs = {'empty_perm... (1294)
