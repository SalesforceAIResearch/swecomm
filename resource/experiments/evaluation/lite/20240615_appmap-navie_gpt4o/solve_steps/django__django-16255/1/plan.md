**Title**: Handle empty item sequence in `get_latest_lastmod` method to prevent ValueError

**Problem**:
When a sitemap contains no items but supports returning `lastmod` for an item, it raises a `ValueError` due to an attempt to find the maximum in an empty sequence. Specifically, when the `max` function is called with an empty list in the `get_latest_lastmod` method, it fails with a `ValueError`.

**Analysis**:
The issue arises because the `max` function cannot operate on an empty sequence, a situation which can occur if the `items` method returns an empty list. The current exception handling in the `get_latest_lastmod` method catches a `TypeError` but does not handle a `ValueError`, which is what is raised by the `max` function when applied to an empty sequence.

To fix this, the exception handling should be expanded to also catch `ValueError`. This will gracefully handle the case of an empty sequence returned by `self.items()` and return `None`.

**Proposed Changes**:
**File**: `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`

1. Modify the exception handling in the `get_latest_lastmod` method to include `ValueError`.
   
   **Function**: `get_latest_lastmod`
   **Original Logic**:
   
   
   **Updated Logic**:
   

By handling both `TypeError` and `ValueError`, the method will return `None` gracefully without causing an unhandled exception, ensuring that the consumer code does not experience a failure when the sitemap items are empty.
