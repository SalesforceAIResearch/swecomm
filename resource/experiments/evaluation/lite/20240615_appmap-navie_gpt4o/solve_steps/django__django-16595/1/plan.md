**Title: Enhance MigrationOptimizer to Reduce Multiple AlterField Operations Efficiently**

**Problem:**
When multiple `AlterField` operations target the same model and field, the `MigrationOptimizer` does not reduce them properly. As a result, executing the optimizer returns a list containing each `AlterField` operation, instead of merging them into a single optimized operation. This behavior is unexpected and likely suboptimal, as it leads to unnecessary operations being performed on the database schema.

**Analysis:**
The root cause of the issue lies in the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class. Currently, this method does not account for cases where it encounters another `AlterField` targeting the same model and field. The absence of this logic in the reduction method means that the optimizer does not attempt to merge these operations, resulting in a list with multiple, separate `AlterField` instances.

To remedy this, the reduction logic must be enhanced to recognize and handle consecutive `AlterField` operations targeting the same field. Specifically, if an `AlterField` operation encounters another `AlterField` that modifies the same field attributes, the optimizer should merge them into a single operation that encompasses all changes.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py**

   - **Class: `AlterField`**
     - **Method: `reduce`**
       Expand the `reduce` method to identify and handle cases where the provided `operation` is an instance of `AlterField` targeting the same field.
       - Update the `reduce` method to include additional checks and merge logic for `AlterField` instances.
       - If the current `AlterField` can be absorbed into the previous one (when changes don't conflict), return a single combined `AlterField` operation.

2. **File: django/db/migrations/optimizer.py**

   - **Method: `optimize_inner`**
     - Update the inner optimization loop to make use of the enhanced `reduce` method in `AlterField`.
     - Ensure the loop correctly identifies and merges consecutive `AlterField` operations targeting the same field.

**Detailed Proposed Changes:**

1. **File: django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py**

   - **Class: `AlterField`**
     - **Method: `reduce`**
       - Check if `operation` is an instance of `AlterField` and if both operations target the same model and field using `is_same_field_operation`.
       - Implement logic to merge the field attributes of both `AlterField` operations. Ensure merged operation retains the most updated attributes.

2. **File: django/db/migrations/optimizer.py**

   - **Method: `optimize_inner`**
     - Adjust the inner loop to call the enhanced `reduce` method and correctly merge consecutive `AlterField` operations based on the new criteria.

By performing these modifications, consecutive `AlterField` operations targeting the same model field will be appropriately reduced, thus making the migration process more efficient and cleaner. This approach ensures that field alteration changes are consolidated, minimizing the number of database operations and thus optimizing the migration process.
