**Title**: Update `AlterField` to Correctly Reduce Multiple Consecutive AlterField Operations

**Problem**:
The `MigrationOptimizer` class in Django does not reduce multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations on the same field, resulting in suboptimal migration files. This is because the `AlterField.reduce()` method does not consider cases where the operation is also an `AlterField`.

**Analysis**:
The current implementation in `AlterField.reduce()` only reduces when the operation is not related to the same field or model. Multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations should be reducible into a single `AlterField` operation but this does not occur due to a lack of such handling within the `reduce` method.

We should update the `AlterField.reduce()` method to handle instances where the operation is an `AlterField` on the same field, simplifying these into a single `AlterField` operation.

**Proposed Changes**:
**File**: `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`

1. Modify the `reduce()` method in the `AlterField` class:
   - Add a conditional check to see if the incoming operation is also an `AlterField`.
   - If it is, and it affects the same field, then reduce the operations to return only the incoming `AlterField`.

Detailed Description of Changes:
- **AlterField.reduce()**:
  - Currently, this method only stops reductions if the operation does not reference the same field/model.
  - Extend this method to include a check whether both the current and incoming operations are `AlterField` operations and affect the same field.
  - When the check passes, it should return a list containing just the incoming `AlterField` operation, effectively reducing multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations into one.

Here's how the specific logic in the `reduce()` method should be: 
- Check if `operation` is an instance of `AlterField`.
- Ensure that the operation affects the same field and model as the current operation.
- If both conditions are met, return a list with the incoming `AlterField` operation.

Once these changes are implemented, running the optimization on multiple consecutive `AlterField` operations will result in a single `AlterField` operation.

The change should be made only in the `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` file. Update the `reduce()` method in the `AlterField` class as discussed. This will ensure that the optimizer can successfully combine multiple `AlterField` operations into one.
