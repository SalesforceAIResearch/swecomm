**Title**: Implement `__radd__` method in `SimpleLazyObject`

**Problem**:
The `SimpleLazyObject` class in the `django.utils.functional` module is missing the `__radd__` method. This omission causes issues when using the reverse addition operation, such as `other + instance_of_SimpleLazyObject`. The implementation of `__radd__` cannot simply be `new_method_proxy(operator.radd)` since `operator.radd` does not exist, nor can it be `new_method_proxy(operator.attrgetter("__radd__"))` because the attribute might not be immediately present for all types and `attrgetter` does not handle exceptions correctly.

**Analysis**:
The `SimpleLazyObject` class is intended to delay the instantiation of a wrapped object until necessary. The proxy methods provided (`new_method_proxy`) help in delegating the calls to the wrapped object once it's instantiated. However, some special methods like `__radd__` need to be explicitly implemented because Python does not have corresponding operators in the `operator` module.

The provided minimal working implementation for `__radd__` should involve:
1. Checking if `_wrapped` is empty and calling `_setup()` to initialize it if necessary.
2. Performing the reverse addition operation on the wrapped object.

**Proposed Changes**:
File to change: `django/utils/functional.py`

1. **Locate the `SimpleLazyObject` class definition**: Ensure you are working within the `SimpleLazyObject` class. It's defined around line 385.

2. **Add the `__radd__` method**: Implement the method within the `SimpleLazyObject` class to handle reverse addition.

Detailed steps:
- **Navigate to the `SimpleLazyObject` class**.
- **Insert the method definition for `__radd__`** below the existing methods:
  - Before performing the operation, check if `_wrapped` is `empty` and call `_setup()` if necessary.
  - Return the result of `other + self._wrapped`, where `self._wrapped` is the lazy-loaded object.

After the changes, the class should look like this (in logical structure, not the actual code):



By adding this function, the `SimpleLazyObject` will correctly handle reverse addition operations, ensuring compatibility and expected behavior when it participates in such operations. This covers the minimal and specific method implementation required to resolve the issue described.
