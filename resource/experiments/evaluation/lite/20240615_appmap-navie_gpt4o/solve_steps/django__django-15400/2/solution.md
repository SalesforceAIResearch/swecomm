I'll walk you through the specific changes needed to implement the `__radd__` method in the `SimpleLazyObject` class in the `django/utils/functional.py` file.

### Modifications:

1. **Add the `__radd__` Method**:
   - Implement the `__radd__` method in the `SimpleLazyObject` class to handle reverse addition.
   - Before performing the operation, check if `_wrapped` is empty and call `_setup()` if necessary.
   - Return the result of `other + self._wrapped`, where `self._wrapped` is the lazy-loaded object.

Here's the proposed change:

    """

    def __init__(self, func):
        """

        callable can be safely run more than once and will return the same
        value.

        self.__dict__["_setupfunc"] = func

        self.__dict__["_setupfunc"] = func

    def __radd__(self, other):
        """

        """
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            self._setup()
        return other + self._wrapped
]]></modified>
</change>
```

### Notes:
- The new `__radd__` function starts with checking if `_wrapped` is `empty`. If it is, `_setup()` is called to initialize it.
- The reverse addition is then performed with `self._wrapped`.

By adding this function, `SimpleLazyObject` will correctly handle reverse addition operations, ensuring compatibility and expected behavior when it participates in such operations.
