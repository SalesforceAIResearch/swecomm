**Title**: Implement `__radd__` Method in `SimpleLazyObject`

**Problem**: 
The `SimpleLazyObject` class in Django does not implement the `__radd__` method, leading to issues when trying to add an instance of `SimpleLazyObject` using the right-hand addition operator (`+`). This was causing problems because there isn't a straightforward way to defer the addition to the wrapped object, especially given that `operator.radd` does not exist.

**Analysis**:
The `SimpleLazyObject` class is designed to defer the creation of the object it wraps until it is needed. This deferred evaluation poses a problem for right-hand addition, as the addition operation needs to be applied to the wrapped object, which might not be initialized at the time of the operation. 

Given that `operator.radd` does not exist and `operator.attrgetter("__radd__")` is unreliable (as many types do not have `__radd__` implemented and will throw an exception), the right approach, as identified, is to manually implement the `__radd__` method to mimic the behavior required for such an operation. This involves ensuring the wrapped object is initialized and then performing the right-hand addition with the wrapped object.

**Proposed Changes**:
* Modify the `SimpleLazyObject` class located in `django/utils/functional.py` to include the implementation of the `__radd__` method.

  1. Implement the `__radd__` method to ensure the wrapped object is initialized using the `_setup` method if itâ€™s not already initialized.
  2. Perform the right-hand addition operation using the wrapped object.

**Changes to be made**:
1. **File**: `django/utils/functional.py`
   
   In the `SimpleLazyObject` class, add the following method:

   - **Method**: `__radd__(self, other)`
     - **Logic**:
       1. Check if `self._wrapped` is `empty`. If it is, call `self._setup()` to initialize the wrapped object.
       2. Return the result of the addition of `other` and `self._wrapped`.

Here's a detailed description of the modification:

In `django/utils/functional.py`, within the `SimpleLazyObject` class:
1. Add the `__radd__` method.
   - Within this method, check if `self._wrapped` is `empty`. If it is, call `self._setup()`.
   - Return the addition of `other` and `self._wrapped`.

By following this plan, the right-hand addition operation will correctly defer to the wrapped object, resolving the issue with `SimpleLazyObject` not implementing `__radd__`.
