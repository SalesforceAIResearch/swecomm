**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

SimpleLazyObject doesn't implement __radd__
Description
	
Technically, there's a whole bunch of magic methods it doesn't implement, compared to a complete proxy implementation, like that of wrapt.ObjectProxy, but __radd__ being missing is the one that's biting me at the moment.
As far as I can tell, the implementation can't just be
__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.radd)
because that doesn't exist, which is rubbish.
__radd__ = new_method_proxy(operator.attrgetter("__radd__"))
also won't work because types may not have that attr, and attrgetter doesn't supress the exception (correctly)
The minimal implementation I've found that works for me is:
	def __radd__(self, other):
		if self._wrapped is empty:
			self._setup()
		return other + self._wrapped
