Given the test errors, it shows that the `utils_tests_category` table is missing, which caused an `sqlite3.OperationalError`. It appears that the categories required for the test are not getting created. We can fix this issue by adding the necessary model migrations to create these tables before running the tests.

You should ensure that the test database is correctly set up before running the test cases. Below are the changes to apply the migrations for tests.

```xml

```

This change ensures that necessary migrations are run before the test case executes, which should create the missing `utils_tests_category` table and prevent the `sqlite3.OperationalError`.
