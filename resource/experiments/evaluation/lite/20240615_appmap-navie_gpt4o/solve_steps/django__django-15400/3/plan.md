**Title: Add `__radd__` implementation to `SimpleLazyObject`**

**Problem:**
The `SimpleLazyObject` class in Django's codebase is missing the `__radd__` method, which results in issues when trying to use the reverse addition operator with instances of `SimpleLazyObject`. The usual proxy method creation using `new_method_proxy` won't work because `operator` module does not provide a built-in function for reverse addition. Adding a manual implementation for this method is necessary to resolve this issue.

**Analysis:**
The `SimpleLazyObject` class acts as a proxy to delay the instantiation of the wrapped class until it is needed. The reverse addition (`__radd__`) method is not implemented, which causes issues when trying to use `+` with an instance of `SimpleLazyObject` on the right-hand side. Unlike other magic methods, `operator` module does not provide a direct proxy function for `__radd__`, given the attributes may not exist on some types.

The minimalist implementation should manually check if the wrapped object is initialized and then perform the operation, thus bypassing the limitations of `operator.attrgetter`.

**Proposed Changes:**
**File to be changed:** `django/utils/functional.py`

1. **Add `__radd__` method to `SimpleLazyObject` class:**
    - Locate the `SimpleLazyObject` class within `django/utils/functional.py`.
    - Implement the `__radd__` method manually within the class to handle reverse addition.

Proposed change to `SimpleLazyObject` class:
- Add the following method:
    - 


**Change Details:**
1. **Locate `django/utils/functional.py`** file.

2. **Within the `SimpleLazyObject` class**, add the `__radd__` method.

3. **Ensure the method follows the structure** of other similar methods within the `SimpleLazyObject` class to maintain coherence and functionality:

  
Add the following code in the appropriate spot within the `SimpleLazyObject` class (suggested position is after similar arithmetic methods like `__add__` if they exist):



This change will ensure that `SimpleLazyObject` correctly handles reverse addition operations.
