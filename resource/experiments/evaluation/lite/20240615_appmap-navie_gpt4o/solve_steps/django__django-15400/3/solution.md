Based on the issue description provided, we need to implement the `__radd__` method within the `SimpleLazyObject` class located in the `django/utils/functional.py` file. I'll add this method to the appropriate spot in the class.

Here's the change in the required format:

class SimpleLazyObject(LazyObject):
    """
    A lazy object initialized from any function.

    known type, use django.utils.functional.lazy.
    """

    def __init__(self, func):
        """
        Pass in a callable that returns the object to be wrapped.

        value.

        self.__dict__["_setupfunc"] = func
        super().__init__()

    def _setup(self):
        self._wrapped = self._setupfunc()

    # Return a meaningful representation of the lazy object for debugging
    # without evaluating the wrapped object.
    def __repr__(self):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            repr_attr = self._setupfunc
        else:
            repr_attr = self._wrapped
        return "<%s: %r>" % (type(self).__name__, repr_attr)

    def __copy__(self):
        if self._wrapped is empty:
            # If uninitialized, copy the wrapper. Use SimpleLazyObject, not
            # self.__class__, because the latter is proxied.
            return SimpleLazyObject(self._setupfunc)
        else:
            # If initialized, return a copy of the wrapped object.
            return copy.copy(self._wrapped)

```

This change introduces the `__radd__` method to the `SimpleLazyObject` class, ensuring that instances of SimpleLazyObject can correctly handle reverse addition operations.
