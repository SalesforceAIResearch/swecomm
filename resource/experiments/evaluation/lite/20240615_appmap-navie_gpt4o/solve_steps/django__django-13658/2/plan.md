**Title:** Modify `CommandParser` instantiation to use `self.prog_name` instead of `sys.argv[0]` 

**Problem:** 
In the `ManagementUtility` class, while parsing the program name from the passed `argv` arguments, the program uses `sys.argv[0]` later for setting up the program name in `CommandParser`. This can result in issues in environments where `sys.argv[0]` is incorrectly set to `None`. 

**Analysis:** 
The `ManagementUtility` class initializes with a custom `argv` if provided, extracts the program name using this `argv`, and assigns it to `self.prog_name`. Despite this, when creating an instance of `CommandParser`, the program name is indirectly fetched from `sys.argv[0]` via `%(prog)s`. This leads to inconsistency, especially in contexts where `sys.argv[0]` is `None`. The adverse effect is that any system-dependent exceptions related to an incorrect `sys.argv[0]` surface while parsing options like `--pythonpath` and `--settings`.

To rectify this, `CommandParser` should be instantiated with `prog=self.prog_name`, ensuring it correctly uses `self.prog_name` even in customised or embedded environments. Consequently, this will make the utility more robust.

**Proposed Changes:** 
1. **File:** `django/core/management/__init__.py`
   - **Function:** `ManagementUtility.__init__`
     The instantiation of the `CommandParser` should be modified to:
     - Explicitly pass the calculated `self.prog_name` to the `CommandParser`.

Modify the following code segment:



To:

 

This modification will ensure that the `CommandParser` uses `self.prog_name` directly, maintaining consistency and avoiding pitfalls associated with `sys.argv[0]`.

---

By implementing the above change, the `ManagementUtility` will behave more reliably in varied deployment scenarios, especially where the default `sys.argv` may not be reliable.
