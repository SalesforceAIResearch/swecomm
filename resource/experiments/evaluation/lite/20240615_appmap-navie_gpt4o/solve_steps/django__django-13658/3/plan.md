**Title**: Update ManagementUtility to pass prog argument when instantiating CommandParser

**Problem**: 
The `ManagementUtility` class in Django parses the program name (`prog_name`) from the `argv` argument passed to it or from `sys.argv` if `argv` is not provided. However, when it creates a `CommandParser` to parse `--pythonpath` and `--settings`, it does not use this computed program name but instead defaults to `sys.argv`. This can cause issues in environments where `sys.argv[0]` is not accurately set, leading to incorrect program naming and possible failures in command execution.

**Analysis**: 
To ensure that the program name parsed from `argv` (or `sys.argv` when `argv` is not provided) is consistently used, the computed `self.prog_name` should be explicitly passed as the `prog` argument to the `CommandParser`. This change would make the `CommandParser` use `self.prog_name` instead of implicitly falling back to `sys.argv[0]`, ensuring consistent behavior in cases where `sys.argv[0]` might be `None` or incorrectly set.

**Proposed Changes**:
Change the instantiation of `CommandParser` to include the `prog=self.prog_name` argument.

1. **File**: `django/core/management/__init__.py`
   - **Section to modify**: Around the instantiation of `CommandParser` within the `ManagementUtility` class.
   - **Specific change**:
     

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. Locate the `__init__.py` file within the `django/core/management` directory.
2. Find the precise location where `CommandParser` is instantiated to parse `--pythonpath` and `--settings`, which is around line 344.
3. Modify the `CommandParser` instantiation by adding `prog=self.prog_name` as an argument.
4. Save the file and ensure no other part of the logic is affected.

By making this change, the `ManagementUtility` will use the correct program name when initiating the `CommandParser`, which resolves the issue for environments where `sys.argv[0]` might be incorrectly set to `None`. This change does not require altering the logic downstream of this parser creation, ensuring minimal impact on the existing codebase.
