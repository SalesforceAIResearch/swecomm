"show_save_as_new" in admin can add without this permission
Description
	 
		(last modified by Mariusz Felisiak)
	 
At "django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py" file, line 102, I think you must put one more verification for this tag: "and has_add_permission", because "save_as_new" is a add modification.
I rewrite this for my project:
			"show_save_as_new": not is_popup
			and has_add_permission # This line that I put!!!
			and has_change_permission
			and change
			and save_as,
