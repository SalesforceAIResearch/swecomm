**Title**: Add has_add_permission check for "show_save_as_new" in admin template tags

**Problem**: The "show_save_as_new" option in the Django admin interface allows users to save an item as new without checking if the user has add permissions. This can lead to unauthorized modifications where users who only have change permissions but no add permissions can still save items as new.

**Analysis**: The root cause of this issue is that the condition for showing the "save as new" option does not include a check for add permissions. The responsible code is in the `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` file, specifically around line 102. The logic needs to be updated to include a check for the `has_add_permission` attribute to ensure that only users with the appropriate permissions can see and use the "save as new" option.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`
2. **Modification**:
    - Update the logic around line 102 where the "show_save_as_new" context variable is set.
    - Add an additional check for `has_add_permission`.

Here are the detailed steps:
1. **Locate the "show_save_as_new" logic**:
   - Find the section where the context dictionary is prepared, specifically the part setting the "show_save_as_new" variable.
   
2. **Add the has_add_permission Check**:
   - Modify the conditional assignment of "show_save_as_new" to include the `has_add_permission` check.
   - Ensure that the logic includes this additional check, while retaining the existing conditions for `not is_popup`, `has_change_permission`, `change`, and `save_as`.

Example of the logical update (you will need to translate this into code and apply it on the specified lines):


By implementing this change, the "save as new" option will only be displayed to users who have both add and change permissions, thus aligning with proper permission management in the Django admin interface.
