**Title**: Normalize QDP commands to upper case in ascii.qdp Table format

**Problem**: The `ascii.qdp` module assumes that commands in a QDP file are in uppercase (e.g., "READ SERR 1 2"), but QDP itself is not case-sensitive and can accept commands in lowercase (e.g., "read serr 1 2"). This expectation causes crashes when attempting to read QDP files with commands in lowercase.

**Analysis**: The issue arises because the `ascii.qdp` code does not account for the fact that QDP commands can be in various cases. The `_line_type` function and other parsing functions need to be modified to handle commands case-insensitively. This can be done by converting lines to uppercase before processing them for command identification.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **Modify `_line_type` function**:
   - Convert the input line to uppercase before applying regular expressions to identify the line type. This ensures that commands are detected correctly regardless of their case.

2. **Update `_command_re` in the `_line_type` function**:
   - Ensure the regular expression for command identification accounts for case insensitivity.

### Changes to be made:

1. **File**: `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py`
   - **Function**: `_line_type(line, delimiter=None)`

     Modify the function to convert the `line` to uppercase before checking its type:
     - Affected lines: Around the string manipulation and regex matching logic.
     - Logic update:
       - Convert `line` to uppercase with `line = line.upper()` before matching with `_line_type_re`.

Example change outline:
- Before: `line = line.strip()`
- After: `line = line.strip().upper()`

2. **File**: `astropy/io/ascii/qdp.py`
   - **Regex**: `_command_re`
     - Ensure the regex for commands in `_command_re` is case-insensitive by making use of regex flags (`re.IGNORECASE`) or matching both uppercase and lowercase versions.

Example change outline:
- Before: `_command_re = r"READ [TS]ERR(\s+[0-9]+)+"`
- After: `_command_re = r"(?i)READ [TS]ERR(\s+[0-9]+)+"`

These changes will ensure that commands in QDP files are correctly identified regardless of their case, making the module more robust and user-friendly.

**Summary**:
To address this issue, convert the input lines to uppercase before command identification and ensure the command regex is case-insensitive. This approach ensures compatibility with QDP files containing commands in any case.
