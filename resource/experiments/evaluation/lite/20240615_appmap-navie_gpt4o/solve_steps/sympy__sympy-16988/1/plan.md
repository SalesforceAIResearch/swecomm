**Title**:
Modify `intersection_sets` to Handle Duplicate Elements Correctly

**Problem**:
The `intersection_sets` function in the SymPy library does not handle duplicate elements correctly when computing intersections. As a result, it can return invalid or unexpected results under certain conditions.

**Analysis**:
The provided implementation of `intersection_sets` prioritizes handling specific cases for various types of sets (e.g., `FiniteSet`, `ConditionSet`, etc.) but does not explicitly handle the scenario where duplicates are present. To address this issue, we need to ensure that duplicates are removed during the intersection computation, producing a result that conforms to canonical processing.

I'll focus on the intersection functionality for `FiniteSet` as this is the most relevant implementation for sets containing manually specified numbers that could include duplicates.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Changes to the intersection function for `FiniteSet` to remove duplicates.
2. Ensure the function correctly handles indeterminate elements by leaving them as unevaluated or using `Piecewise()` expressions as appropriate.

**File**: `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`

**Detailed Description**:
1. **File**: `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`
    - **Function**: Modify the `intersection_sets(a, b)` function having `@dispatch(FiniteSet, FiniteSet)` and `@dispatch(FiniteSet, Set)` decorators.
    - **Logic**:
      - In the function that handles `FiniteSet, FiniteSet`:
         - Convert both sets `a` and `b` to sets to eliminate any duplicates and then find their intersection.
         - Return the intersection.
      - In the function that handles `FiniteSet, Set`:
         - Convert the FiniteSet `a` to a set to eliminate duplicates.
         - If evaluation is not possible (such as in symbolic ranges), leave the intersection unevaluated or use a `Piecewise()` expression where needed.

**Proposed Changes** detail:

### Modification in `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`

1. Find the function that handles intersection for `FiniteSet, FiniteSet`:
    - **Original**:
      
    - **Modified**:
      

2. Find the function that handles intersection for `FiniteSet, Set`:
    - **Original**:
      
    - **Modified**:
      

By making these changes, the `intersection_sets` function will properly handle duplicates and return the expected intersection results, ensuring consistency and correctness in intersections involving duplicated elements.
