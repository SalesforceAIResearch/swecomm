Intersection should remove duplicates
```python
>>> Intersection({1},{1},{x})
EmptySet()
>>> Intersection({1},{x})
{1}
```
The answer should be `Piecewise(({1}, Eq(x, 1)), (S.EmptySet, True))` or remain unevaluated.

The routine should give the same answer if duplicates are present; my initial guess is that duplicates should just be removed at the outset of instantiation. Ordering them will produce canonical processing.
