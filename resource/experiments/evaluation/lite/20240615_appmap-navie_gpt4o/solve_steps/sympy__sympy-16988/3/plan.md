**Title**: Modify `intersection_sets` to Remove Duplicates in Set Intersections

**Problem**: The `Intersection` function in the SymPy library returns incorrect results when sets with duplicates are involved. Specifically, it returns non-empty sets when duplicates could cause empty results.

**Analysis**: The `Intersection` function needs to ensure that duplicates are properly handled. If duplicates exist, the result should properly reflect this, potentially returning an expression wrapped in a `Piecewise` construct with conditions for the duplicates. Without handling duplicates correctly, the logical interpretation of intersections remains flawed, especially when symbolic elements are involved.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py**

    - Modify or add logic within the `intersection_sets` function to remove duplicates before processing the intersection.
    - Introduce an initial step to deduplicate the sets being intersected. If duplicates exist, which could be symbolic or numeric, ensure that they are removed while maintaining logical correctness.
    - Implement logic to return a `Piecewise` construct when symbolic conditions are involved, ensuring that the results differentiate between cases with and without duplicates.

    **Steps to be implemented**:
    - On receiving sets `a` and `b`, convert them to lists removing duplicates.
    - If duplicates exist and their evaluation changes based on `Piecewise` conditions, prepare a `Piecewise` return value.
    - For example:
        - If duplicates are entirely numeric or can be evaluated as numeric, remove them straightforwardly.
        - If duplicates involve symbolic elements, wrap them in a `Piecewise` construct.
    - Ensure to update and maintain existing logic that handles different specific types of sets (like FiniteSet, Integers, Reals, etc.), ensuring the new deduplication step does not break these.

By implementing these changes, duplicates will be consistently removed, and the intersection logic will handle symbolic elements correctly, providing accurate results aligned with the user's expectations.
