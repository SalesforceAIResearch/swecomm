### Title: Update Intersection Routine to Remove Duplicates and Handle Piecewise Conditions

### Problem
The `Intersection` function should correctly handle sets by removing duplicates and producing the appropriate output. In certain cases, it should return a `Piecewise` object with specific conditions. 

* Example 1: `Intersection({1},{1},{x})` should result in `S.EmptySet`.
* Example 2: `Intersection({1},{x})` should result in `{1}`.

When duplicates are found, the duplicates should be removed, and the function should potentially return a `Piecewise` object.

### Analysis
The current implementation of `Intersection` does not handle duplicate entries properly. This causes incorrect results, especially in cases where the intersection should either be empty or dependent on conditions (e.g., for symbolic elements).

By removing duplicates from the input sets initially and then computing the intersections, we can ensure consistent and expected results. Additionally, implementing a check for symbolic intersections with different elements presents an opportunity to leverage the `Piecewise` structure which allows for conditional logic.

### Proposed Changes
1. **File**: `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`

   **Changes**:
   - **Pre-process Inputs**: Modify the `intersection_sets` function to remove duplicates at the outset.
   - **Implement Conditional Logic**: Include logic to create `Piecewise` objects when symbolic conditions are detected.
   - **Canonical Ordering**: Ensure that input sets are ordered to maintain consistency and canonical forms.

2. **Detailed Updates**:
   - **Intersection Function Update**:
     - Incorporate deduplication of sets in `intersection_sets`.
     - Add logic to differentiate between numeric and symbolic elements, generating a `Piecewise` object in the latter case.

3. **Example Update**:
   - Ensure the example use cases provided in the problem statement are covered in the modified function logic.

### Proposed Changes to `sympy/sets/handlers/intersection.py`

1. **Pre-process Inputs to Remove Duplicates**:
   
   Within `intersection_sets` function, before performing any intersection logic, modify the inputs to remove duplicates:
   
   

2. **Implement Conditional Logic with `Piecewise`**:

   When encountering symbolic elements, return a `Piecewise` object:
   
   

**Conclusion**:
These changes will ensure that duplicate entries are removed and the function correctly returns a `Piecewise` set when symbolic conditions are present, ensuring canonical and correct processing of `Intersection` cases as specified.
