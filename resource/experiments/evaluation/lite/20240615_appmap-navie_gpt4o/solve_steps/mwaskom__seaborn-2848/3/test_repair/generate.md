The error indicates that the `pytest` command is not found. This commonly occurs when the Python environment doesn't have pytest installed or it isn't properly activated. The solution is to ensure pytest is installed in the correct environment.

Let's modify the CI configuration to make sure pytest is installed before running the tests.

```xml
<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">.github/workflows/ci.yml</file>
<original line-count="8" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[

    steps:

        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.8'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install pytest
          pip install -r requirements.txt
          pip install -e .

      - name: Run tests
        run: pytest
]]></modified>

```

Here, I added steps to set up Python, install the dependencies including `pytest`, and then run the tests using `pytest`. This ensures that the `pytest` command will be available when running the tests.
