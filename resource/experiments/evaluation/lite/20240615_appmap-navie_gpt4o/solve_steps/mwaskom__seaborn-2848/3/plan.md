**Title**: Fix PairGrid Error When Using `hue` Argument in `map` Method with Categorical Data

**Problem**:
When using the `hue` argument in the `map` method on a `PairGrid` object with categorical data in seaborn version 0.11.1, an error is raised indicating issues with key lookups and normalization, specifically with `NoneType` not being callable and `isnan` ufunc not supported for input types. This issue does not occur in seaborn version 0.11.0 or earlier versions.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of the issue is related to the handling of categorical data in the `hue` mapping of the `scatterplot` function while being used in combination with `PairGrid`. The error traces back to the `_lookup_single` method which attempts to get a hue value but encounters issues due to improper handling of categorical data.

The error message suggests that the `hue` variable is being processed in a way that is incompatible with the methodâ€™s expectations. Specifically, the error arises from the `self.norm(key)` call in the '_core.py' file when it tries to normalize a categorical hue key which is not supported, leading to errors when `NoneType` is interacted with or when trying to check `isnan` on inappropriate input types.

**Proposed Changes**:
To address this, we need to ensure that the hue normalization handles categorical keys correctly within the `scatterplot` function and related call chains. The primary file to modify is `seaborn/relational.py`.

1. **Modify ScatterPlotter Initialization** (`seaborn/relational.py`):
    - Update the `_ScatterPlotter` class to include proper initialization and handling of categorical hue values, ensuring that normalization logic properly accounts for categorical data and does not attempt to treat them as numeric.

2. **Update `_lookup_single` Method** (in `seaborn/_core.py`):
    - Modify the `_lookup_single` method to ensure it recognizes when a key is intended to be categorical and appropriately bypasses or handles normalization.

3. **Ensure Semantic Handling** (modifications in `seaborn/relational.py`):
    - Ensure that when mapping hue, size, and style in the plot methods, the handling of these attributes checks and correctly maps for categorical values avoiding attempts to normalize or cast improperly.

**File to Change**: `seaborn/relational.py`

**Detailed Description of Changes**:
1. **In `scatterplot` Method** (`seaborn/relational.py`)
    - Ensure that the hue mapping does not misinterpret categorical data and avoids unnecessary normalization.

2. **ScatterPlotter Class Adjustments**:
    - In `_ScatterPlotter.plot()`, modify the handling logic for hue to correctly map categorical data.
    - Ensure the `self.norm` is only called on numeric types and properly handle categorical data directly through a lookup or equivalent logic.

3. **Semantic Mapping Adjustments** (`seaborn/_core.py`):
    - Modify `_core.py` around the `norm` method to ensure it can differentiate and properly handle categorical data types.

These modifications should resolve the issue by ensuring that categorical data is handled as intended without attempts to improperly normalize or process them in ways that are incompatible with their type.

By implementing these changes, we should restore the functionality to handle `hue` with categorical data in PairGrid and resolve the reported errors.
