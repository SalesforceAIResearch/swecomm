The issue with the error message indicating "`pytest: command not found`" can be fixed by ensuring that `pytest` is installed in the Conda environment. This can be quickly resolved by adding a command to install `pytest`. Here's how you can accomplish this:

```bash
conda install pytest
```

However, the most appropriate place to add this statement is in the environment.yml or the requirements.txt used in setting up the environment. 

Here's a fixed environment setup snippet:

<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">environment.yml</file>
<original line-count="1" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
name: myenv
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
name: myenv
channels:
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.8
  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - pytest
]]></modified>
</change>

And if a `requirements.txt` is used:

<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">requirements.txt</file>
<original line-count="1" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
pytest
]]></modified>
</change>

By ensuring that `pytest` is installed in your environment, the issue of the command not being found will be resolved. If the environment setup is deliberate and the toolchain demands the command manually, it is good to document this step in a setup script or in the project documentation.
