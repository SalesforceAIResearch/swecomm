**Title**: Fix KeyError/TypeError when using `hue` in `map` for PairGrid with categorical values in seaborn

**Problem**: 
When using a `hue` keyword in the `map` method within a `PairGrid`, a `KeyError` and subsequent `TypeError` occurs in seaborn version 0.11.1. This behavior was not present in version 0.9.0 and appears to be related to handling categorical values directly within the `map` function rather than when creating the `PairGrid`.

**Analysis**:
The root cause of this issue stems from how the `_hue_map` handles categorical values when provided directly in the `map` method. The current implementation expects categorical values to be part of the initial PairGrid setup rather than supplied dynamically in the `map` method.

Here are the probable areas that need addressing:
1. **Hue Mapping**: Current seaborn version attempts to map hue values directly during the plot invocation which results in the `_hue_map` trying to access values directly from a lookup table that isnâ€™t properly initialized for categorical data in the `map` step.
2. **Normalization Handling**: When the `_hue_map` fails to find the key, it tries to normalize it resulting in a `TypeError` as the normalization function (`norm`) is `None` for categorical variables.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `seaborn/relational.py`

    - **Function Handling**: 
          - Check existing initialization sequences of `_hue_map` to ensure the look-up table includes hue values dynamically sent through `map`.
          - Introduce an extra check in the `_lookup_single` function to handle missing keys gracefully and prevent it from attempting a normalization that does not apply for categorical data.
    
    - **Locate the `map` method**:
      Modify the `map` method to dynamically update the hue mapping before plotting:
      - Ensure `self._hue_map.lookup_table` is correctly populated with the hue levels provided dynamically during the `map` invocation.
      - Add a check to see if the `hue` is categorical and handle the `None` case for normalizing function correctly.

    - **Function**: `_lookup_single(self, key)`
      - Needs better error handling for categorical keys lookup.
      - If a key is missing, enrich it using `_populate_hue_lookup` method.

    These are the steps to take within the `relational.py` file ensuring no assumptions on interface change:



By adding the steps mentioned, the `hue` assignment should work regardless of using it in `PairGrid` setup or dynamically in the `map` method. Addressing these additions ensures backward compatibility and fixes for version 0.11.1 inline with earlier seaborn behaviors.
