### Title
Fix KeyError and TypeError for categorical hues in PairGrid map function

### Problem
The `PairGrid` functionality in Seaborn version 0.11.1 generates a `KeyError` and `TypeError` when plotting scatterplots with categorical hue assigned directly in the `map` method. This issue did not occur in Seaborn version 0.9.0 and also works in version 0.11.0.

### Analysis
The issue is primarily arising due to the handling of the hue mapping inside the `map` method when the hue values are passed directly as a parameter, rather than being included in the `PairGrid` initialization. This direct assignment bypasses some of the internal setup that normally ensures proper handling of categorical variables.

In particular:
- The internal hue mapping (`self._hue_map`) lookup table does not correctly find the categorical key when it's directly passed.
- When the key isn't found, it attempts to normalize the key using a `NoneType` norm, leading to the `TypeError`.

### Root Cause
1. **KeyError:** This occurs because the `self._hue_map.lookup_table` does not have the categorical key due to it not being set up properly in the `map` method.
2. **TypeError:** The error occurs when trying to normalize the hue key using a `NoneType` object.

### Proposed Changes
To resolve the issue, adjustments are needed in the handling of hue mappings within the `map` method of `PairGrid`. Specifically, we should ensure that hue mappings are properly initialized when passed directly to the `map` method.

#### seaborn/axisgrid.py

1. **Modify `_map_bivariate` method**: Ensure hue mappings are properly set up even when passed directly.

2. **Modify `_plot_bivariate` method**: Adjust how hue mappings are utilized to ensure they work correctly with categorical variables.

### Detailed Description of Changes

1. **File: seaborn/axisgrid.py**
    - **_map_bivariate method**
      - Before calling the plotting function (`func`), ensure `hue` settings are correctly initialized within the current mapping context. We can add a preprocessing step to set up hue mappings when `hue` is passed directly.

    - **_plot_bivariate method**
      - Modify the method to handle the hue variable correctly, ensuring that categorical hues are correctly mapped and processed.

By ensuring that categorical hue variables are correctly mapped in these steps, the function will correctly interpret the hue and produce the desired scatter plots without the KeyError and TypeError.

### Conclusion
Making these changes will ensure that `PairGrid` can handle categorical hues passed directly in the `map` method without encountering the `KeyError` and `TypeError` seen in Seaborn version 0.11.1. These proposed changes ensure that the hue mappings are initialized and handled correctly, bringing the behavior in line with previous versions and expected functionality.
