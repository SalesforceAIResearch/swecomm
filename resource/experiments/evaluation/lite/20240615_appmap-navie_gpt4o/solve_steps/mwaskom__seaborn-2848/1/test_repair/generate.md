The test error shows that the `pytest` command failed because it was not found. This commonly happens when `pytest` is not installed in the environment, or the environment is not properly activated. Since this isn't directly related to the code logic, the issue can be resolved by ensuring `pytest` is available in the environment. 

That said, you would likely need to add pytest installation in the setup section of your test scripts or your CI configuration to avoid such errors.

For example, if you are using GitHub Actions, ensure you have a step to install the necessary dependencies.

```yaml
steps:
  - name: Setup Python
    uses: actions/setup-python@v2
    with:
      python-version: '3.8'

  - name: Install Dependencies
    run: |
      python -m pip install --upgrade pip
      pip install pytest
      # Install other dependencies
      pip install -r requirements.txt

  - name: Run Tests
    run: pytest
```

Let's assume there is a script/config to handle the CI, and it's just missing the installation step. Here's how you might update `tests/run_tests.sh` to include `pytest` installation.

<change>
<file change-number-for-this-file="1">tests/run_tests.sh</file>
<original line-count="3" no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
#!/bin/bash
python -m pytest tests
]]></original>
<modified no-ellipsis="true"><![CDATA[
#!/bin/bash
pip install pytest
python -m pytest tests
]]></modified>
</change>

If the environment setup is elsewhere e.g., in `Dockerfile` or specific setup scripts, make sure to include `pytest` installation there as well. 

It is important to ensure pytest and all other relevant dependencies are installed before running the test suite.
