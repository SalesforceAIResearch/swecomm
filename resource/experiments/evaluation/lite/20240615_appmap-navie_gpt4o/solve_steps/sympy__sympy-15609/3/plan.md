**Title**: Correct LaTeX Printer for Indexed Matrix Expressions

**Problem**: LaTeX strings for indexed matrix expressions generated by SymPy's LaTeX printer contain incorrect double subscripts, preventing them from being compilable and renderable in MathJax.

**Analysis**: The LaTeX output generated for indexed matrix expressions currently includes an underscore (_) within another subscript, causing LaTeX to raise an error related to double subscripts (e.g., `_i_1`). To correct this issue, the LaTeX printer must be modified to properly handle subscripts, ensuring that variable indices are rendered cleanly and without double underscores.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File to Modify**: `sympy/printing/printer.py`
   
2. **Relevant Function Modification**: Identify the function responsible for printing indexed matrix expressions in LaTeX format. This is likely a method in one of the printer classes, possibly `_print_Indexed`.
   
3. **Modification Steps**:
   - **Locate the Printing Method**: Locate the function that handles the LaTeX conversion for `Indexed` objects, which might look like `_print_Indexed`.
   - **Adjust the Subscript Formatting**: Modify the string formatting within this method to ensure that indices do not result in double underscores. Instead of using automatic subscript generation by directly appending underscores, manually format strings where necessary.
   - **Restructure Index Handling**: Implement logic to handle multiple indices in a way that LaTeX can interpret. This might involve concatenating indices with a different delimiter or adjusting how subscripts are nested.
   - **Update Index Variable Names**: Ensure the index variables (`_i_1`, `_i_2`, etc.) are correctly formatted without multiple underscores. This might involve simply stripping redundant symbols or applying a different concatenation method.

**Detailed Changes Description**:

In `printer.py`:

- **Locate and Update the `_print_Indexed` Method**:
  - Ensure that when creating subscripts, each subscript part of the indices such as `_{i}` or `_{j}` is properly concatenated without causing illegal LaTeX syntax.
  - For example, instead of using default underscore handling which results in `_i_1`, manually construct the LaTeX string to avoid double underscores.

- **Pseudo-code Before Changes**:
  

- **Pseudo-code After Changes**:
  
  The above change ensures proper formatting of indices. You may need to fine-tune the handling based on how indices are combined or optional decorations required by the LaTeX standard for matrices.

By addressing these changes, the printed LaTeX string for indexed matrix expressions will no longer produce double subscripts, ensuring compatibility with LaTeX compilers and renderers such as MathJax.
