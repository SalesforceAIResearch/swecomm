**Title:** Fix LaTeX Printer for Indexed MatrixExpressions to Avoid Double Subscript Error

**Problem:**
When printing LaTeX for indexed matrix expressions involving summations, the current implementation generates invalid LaTeX syntax with double subscripts, which isn't compilable in many LaTeX environments and doesn't render correctly in MathJax. 

**Analysis:**
The root cause of this issue is that the LaTeX printer for matrix expressions doesn't handle subscripts properly when generating the summation symbol. Specifically, the extra underscore in `_i_1` results in a double subscript. 

The approach needs an update in the string formatting logic within the relevant LaTeX printing function(s) to ensure that subscript variables inside the summation do not have additional underscores which break the compilation.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **File to Modify:** `sympy/printing/latex.py`
2. **Function to Modify:** Locate the function responsible for LaTeX printing of `MatrixExpr` and `Indexed` expressions, typically a method such as `_print_Sum` or a related utility that deals with summations.

   - Update the function that handles LaTeX summation to ensure subscripting is valid LaTeX. This may involve:
     a. Removing the automatic use of underscores for subscripts inside the summation expression.
     b. Specifically managing the formatting of the indices to avoid double underscores.

   - The specific sections to update involve:
     - Generation of sum index in LaTeX output.
     - Ensuring all parts of the index (like `i` in `_i_1`) are concatenated properly without causing double underscore issues.
     
Example steps in the function:
- Check and sanitize the subscript and index names to avoid double underscores.
- Use concatenation or replacement logic to ensure the generated LaTeX adheres to proper standards without generating double subscripts.

By implementing these changes, the resulting LaTeX should be compilable both in typical LaTeX tools and render correctly in MathJax.

Please proceed with the described changes in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to implement a functional fix.
