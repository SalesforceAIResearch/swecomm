Based on the test errors provided, there are three main issues to address within the codebase. Here are the changes required to resolve these errors:

1. **Fix `test_issue_8470` and `test_issue_13559` related to `parse_expr` function in `sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py`**:
   Both tests failed due to a `ValueError`: `Name node can't be used with 'False' constant`. This requires inspecting and possibly modifying the `parse_expr` method, however, we don't have that method here. We can search for `compile` usages in similar contexts. We'll ensure `_latex` is correctly implemented for the `MatrixElement`.

2. **Fix `test_MatrixElement_printing` in `sympy/printing/latex.py`**:
   This involves verifying that the `_print_MatrixElement` method within the `LatexPrinter` class is adequately implemented. 

Let's proceed with one specific fix directly related to the second issue: `_print_MatrixElement` for `MatrixElement` in `latex.py`.

### Change 1
**File:** `sympy/printing/latex.py`
**Issue:** `test_MatrixElement_printing` fails due to incorrect LaTeX rendering of Matrix element indices.

        return f"{self._print(expr.parent)}_{{{i},{j}}}"
]]></modified>
</change>

### Expected Fixes

1. The first change ensures that the MatrixElement is rendered in the format `A_{i, j}`, which conforms with standard LaTeX conventions and should resolve assertion failures in the `test_MatrixElement_printing`.

Please implement these changes and rerun the test suite to verify if the issues are resolved. If other parts within `parse_expr` or other `_latex` related functions still show issues, provide additional context, and we will address those subsequently.
