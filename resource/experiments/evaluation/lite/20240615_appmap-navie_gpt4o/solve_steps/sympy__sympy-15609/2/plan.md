**Title**: Fix double subscript issue in LaTeX output for indexed matrix expressions

**Problem**: The LaTeX string generated for indexed matrix expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` objects uses double subscripts, causing LaTeX compilation errors and rendering issues in MathJax.

**Analysis**: The issue arises because the LaTeX printer does not handle nested subscripts appropriately in indexed matrix expressions. When creating the LaTeX string for such expressions, the printer includes an underscore (`_`) which results in multiple levels of subscripts (e.g., `_i_1`), which LaTeX cannot process correctly.

To fix this, the LaTeX printer should avoid directly embedding underscores in subscripts within the summation symbol and instead use a more LaTeX-friendly format. We should replace usage of double underscores with a concatenated form or an alternative delimiter that LaTeX can process correctly.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. Update the LaTeX printer in the file `sympy/printing/latex.py` to correctly format indexed matrix expressions.
2. Specifically, modify the `_print` method handling `MatrixSymbol` objects to ensure the output LaTeX string does not contain double underscores in subscripts.
3. Ensure that any temporary variables used in the summation are formatted in a way that avoids LaTeX errors.

**Detailed Changes**:
1. **sympy/printing/latex.py**:
   - Locate the method responsible for printing indexed matrix expressions.
   - Adjust the LaTeX string generation logic to replace double underscores with concatenated subscripts.
   - Example: Instead of producing `_i_1` and `_i_2`, concatenate the indices into a single subscript or use curly braces to group the indices appropriately.

By making these changes, the LaTeX output should be compilable and render correctly both in LaTeX and MathJax environments.
