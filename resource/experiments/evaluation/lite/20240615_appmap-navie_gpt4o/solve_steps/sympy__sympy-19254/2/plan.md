### Title:
Replace Mignotte Bound with Knuth-Cohen Bound in Polynomial Factoring

### Problem:
The current implementation of the method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` in the `sympy.polys.factortools` module uses the Mignotte bound to calculate bounds for univariate and multivariate polynomials, respectively. Based on research, it has been suggested that the **Knuth-Cohen bound** provides better performance for various polynomials with different degrees, density, and coefficients. Thus, it is proposed that the Mignotte bound should be replaced with the Knuth-Cohen bound.

### Analysis:
To address this issue, the Mignotte-bound-based methods `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` need to be updated to utilize the Knuth-Cohen bound instead. Here are the key steps in understanding the changes required:

1. **Understanding the Knuth-Cohen Bound**:
    - The Knuth-Cohen bound is typically used to provide a tighter upper bound for polynomial coefficients compared to the Mignotte bound.
    - Proper implementation details for computing this bound need to be derived from research papers or specific algorithms related to Knuth-Cohen bound computations.

2. **Replacing the Bound Calculation**:
    - The existing methods in the factor tools that use the Mignotte bound must be modified to compute the Knuth-Cohen bound instead.

### Proposed Changes:
The updates will be focused on the `sympy/polys/factortools.py` file, particularly modifying the `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` functions.

1. **Update `dup_zz_mignotte_bound`**:
   - Modify the bound calculation from the Mignotte bound formula to the Knuth-Cohen bound formula.
   - Replace the current return statement with an appropriate Knuth-Cohen bound computation.

2. **Update `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`**:
   - Similar to the univariate case, modify the bound calculation for multivariate polynomials to utilize the Knuth-Cohen bound.
   - Replace the return statement to reflect the Knuth-Cohen bound computation for multivariate polynomials.

### Specific Changes in `sympy/polys/factortools.py`:

1. **Function `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)`**:
    - Replace the existing Mignotte bound computation:
      - Current code:
        
      - Replace with Knuth-Cohen bound algorithm. Specific formula to be detailed based on the necessary research and algorithm for computing the Knuth-Cohen bound.

2. **Function `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)`**:
    - Replace the existing Mignotte bound computation for multivariate polynomials:
      - Current code:
        
      - Replace with Knuth-Cohen bound for multivariate polynomials. The specific algorithm will need to handle the complexity introduced by multivariate bounds.

By making these updates, the factoring tools will leverage a more efficient calculation for polynomial bounds, improving the overall performance and accuracy as per the research findings.
