**Title**: Replace Mignotte Bound with Knuth-Cohen Bound in `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`

**Problem**: 
The methods `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` in the `sympy.polys.factortools` module currently implement the Mignotte bound for univariate and multivariate polynomials respectively. Research and feedback have indicated that the Knuth-Cohen bound provides better performance and accuracy. Therefore, these methods should be updated to use the Knuth-Cohen bound instead.

**Analysis**:
Both `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound` currently calculate the Mignotte bound which is used to estimate the size of roots of a polynomial. Given the evidence from research and empirical data, it is advisable to replace the existing computation with the Knuth-Cohen bound which has been shown to perform better. 

The Mignotte bound is calculated as:
\[ \text{Mignotte bound} = K.sqrt(K(n + 1)) * 2^n * a * b \]
where `a` is the maximum norm, `b` is the absolute value of the leading coefficient, and `n` is the degree of the polynomial.

For the Knuth-Cohen bound, the formula and logic will be different. This new computation will need to be implemented in place of the Mignotte bound in both methods.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File:** `sympy/polys/factortools.py`
    - **Function `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)`**
        - Replace the existing calculation of the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound. Ensure that the new implementation still follows the existing structure of input parameters and returns the calculated bound.

    - **Function `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)`**
        - Similarly, update this method to compute the Knuth-Cohen bound for multivariate polynomials. Adjust the calculations accordingly while maintaining consistency with the method signature and return type.

### Detailed Changes

#### For `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)`

1. **Identify and extract the required parameters (e.g., max_norm `a`, leading coefficient `b`, degree `n`).** 
2. **Implement the Knuth-Cohen bound formula using these parameters.**
3. **Replace the Mignotte bound calculation with the new Knuth-Cohen bound calculation.**

#### For `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)`

1. **Identify and extract the required parameters in a similar manner (e.g., max_norm `a`, ground leading coefficient `b`, sum of degrees `n`).**
2. **Implement the Knuth-Cohen bound formula for multivariate polynomials using these parameters.**
3. **Replace the Mignotte bound calculation with the new Knuth-Cohen bound calculation.**

Do not change the method signatures or the return types to ensure backward compatibility with existing code that relies on these methods. Verify that the updated functions still pass any existing tests that check their behavior and results, and consider adding new tests that specifically check for the correctness of the Knuth-Cohen bound implementation.

By implementing these changes, the accuracy and performance of the polynomial bound calculations in the `sympy.polys.factortools` module will be improved, as per the research findings and feedback received.
