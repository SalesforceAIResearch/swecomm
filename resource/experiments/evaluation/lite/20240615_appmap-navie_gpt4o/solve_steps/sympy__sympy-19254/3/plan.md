**Title**: Replace Mignotte Bound with Knuth-Cohen Bound in `dup_zz_mignotte_bound` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound`

**Problem**: 
The current implementation of the methods `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)` and `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)` in the `factortools.py` module of `sympy.polys` uses the Mignotte bound to calculate the bound for univariate and multivariate polynomials. Based on research and feedback, it has been suggested to improve the computation by replacing the Mignotte bound with the Knuth-Cohen bound.

**Analysis**:
The Mignotte bound is often used for its simplicity, but the Knuth-Cohen bound can provide tighter and more efficient bounds for polynomials. This change would involve:

1. Calculating the maximum norm of the polynomial.
2. Computing the leading coefficient of the polynomial.
3. Determining the degree of the polynomial.
4. Applying the Knuth-Cohen formula to these values instead of the Mignotte formula.

The following modifications are necessary:

- For univariate polynomials in the method `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)`.
- For multivariate polynomials in the method `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)`.

**Proposed Changes**:

1. **File**: `sympy/polys/factortools.py`
   
   **Function**: `dup_zz_mignotte_bound(f, K)`
   - **Current Logic**:
     - Calculate `a = dup_max_norm(f, K)`
     - Calculate `b = abs(dup_LC(f, K))`
     - Calculate `n = dup_degree(f)`
     - Return `K.sqrt(K(n + 1))*2**n*a*b` (Mignotte Bound)
   
   **Proposed Logic**:
     - Calculate `a = dup_max_norm(f, K)`
     - Calculate `b = abs(dup_LC(f, K))`
     - Calculate `n = dup_degree(f)`
     - Replace the return value with the Knuth-Cohen formula: `K(n**a b + 1)*2^n a b`

2. **Function**: `dmp_zz_mignotte_bound(f, u, K)`
   - **Current Logic**:
     - Calculate `a = dmp_max_norm(f, u, K)`
     - Calculate `b = abs(dmp_ground_LC(f, u, K))`
     - Calculate `n = sum(dmp_degree_list(f, u))`
     - Return `K.sqrt(K(n + 1))*2**n*a*b` (Mignotte Bound)
   
   **Proposed Logic**:
     - Calculate `a = dmp_max_norm(f, u, K)`
     - Calculate `b = abs(dmp_ground_LC(f, u, K))`
     - Calculate `n = sum(dmp_degree_list(f, u))`
     - Replace the return value with the Knuth-Cohen formula: `K(n**a b + 1)*2^n a b`

The fundamental change involves substituting the existing Mignotte logic with the Knuth-Cohen formula to improve the bound's efficiency and accuracy.
