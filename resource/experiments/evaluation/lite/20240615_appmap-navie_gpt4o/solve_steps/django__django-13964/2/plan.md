**Title: Ensure FK Field Update when Related Object Has Non-Auto Primary Key**

**Problem:**
Saving a parent object after setting a child object with a non-numeric primary key leads to data loss. Specifically, for ForeignKey relations to objects with a primary key that is a CharField, assigning the primary key after initialization results in the parent object not correctly recognizing the primary key change. Consequently, the foreign key field in the parent object remains unset (empty string), causing ForeignKeyViolation upon transaction commit.

**Analysis:**
The root issue revolves around how Django handles the assignment and saving of related objects when the related object’s primary key is set after the initial assignment. In this scenario, Django fails to recognize the change in the primary key of the related object, thus not updating the foreign key field in the parent object. Order.product_id remains unset because the foreign key field ‘product_id’ does not get updated when `Product.sku` is set after the initial assignment of `Product` to `Order.product`.

This is likely related to Django’s handling of auto vs non-auto primary keys. More specifically, Django may not be triggering the necessary updates to the parent’s foreign key field when the child’s primary key is set post-instantiation.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **django/db/models/fields/related.py:**
   Modify the ForeignKeyDescriptor’s `__set__` method to account for changes in the primary key of the related object. Ensure that the foreign key field in the parent object is updated whenever the related object’s primary key is modified.

2. **django/db/models/base.py:**
   Adjust the save_base method to ensure foreign key fields are re-evaluated and updated if there are changes in the related object’s primary key during save operations. 

### Detailed Change Descriptions

1. **django/db/models/fields/related.py**
   - Locate the `ForeignKeyDescriptor` class and its `__set__` method.
   - Modify the `__set__` method to include a check for changes in the primary key of the related object.
   - Ensure the foreign key field in the parent object (e.g., `order.product_id`) is updated to reflect the current primary key of the related object (e.g., `product.sku`) even if the primary key of the related object is modified after its initial assignment.

2. **django/db/models/base.py**
   - Find the `Model` class and its `save_base` method.
   - Adjust the `save_base` method to ensure that foreign key fields in the parent object are appropriately updated before the actual save operation.
   - Force a re-evaluation of foreign key fields to incorporate any primary key changes in related objects.

These changes should ensure that any updates to the primary key of a related object are recognized and correctly reflected in the parent object, thus preventing data loss and resolving the ForeignKeyViolation during transaction commits.

This approach will specifically address the behavior of non-auto primary keys being set after the initial assignment to a parent object's foreign key field. These adjustments ensure Django accurately tracks changes in related objects and updates the references appropriately, adhering to expected ORM behavior.

By implementing these changes in `related.py` and `base.py`, we enforce accurate updates to foreign key fields, preventing inconsistencies and potential data integrity issues in database transactions.
