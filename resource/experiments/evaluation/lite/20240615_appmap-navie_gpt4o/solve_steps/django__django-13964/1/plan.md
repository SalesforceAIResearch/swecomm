**Title**: Fix foreign key handling with non-numeric primary key initialization

**Problem**

When saving a parent object with a child object that has a non-numeric primary key initialized after the assignment, the parent object's foreign key is incorrectly set to an empty string. This leads to data loss and incorrect foreign key references.

**Analysis**

The root cause of this issue lies in how the parent object's foreign key (`order.product_id`) is handled when the related child object (`product`) is assigned but does not yet have its primary key set. When the primary key is set later, the parent object does not "see" this change, and the foreign key field remains set to an incorrect default value (an empty string in this case). This behavior may be influenced by the difference between handling auto-increment primary keys and manually-set primary keys.

Here's a more detailed view of the process:

1. The `Order` object is instantiated.
2. An empty `Product` object is assigned to `order.product`.
3. The primary key (`sku`) is set on the `Product` object.
4. The `Product` object is saved.
5. The `Order` object is saved.

During step 4, because the `Product` object did not have its primary key initialized at the time of assignment to `order.product`, the `Order` object's foreign key `product_id` is set to an empty string.

According to the code snippets provided, the logic to handle primary key changes on related objects during assignment seems to be missing. Thus, the `Order` object does not update `product_id` correctly.

**Proposed Changes**

To solve this issue, we need to ensure that the primary key of the related object (in this case, `Product`) is tracked and updated correctly when it is set after assignment. Here is the detailed process to implement the fix based on the `Order` and `Product` models.

1. **Modify `django/db/models/base.py`:**
   - One possible place to fix this would be in the `save` method of the parent model (i.e., `Order`). We need to ensure that when saving the parent model, it checks if its related objects have their primary keys updated and updates the corresponding foreign key fields accordingly.

2. **Modify `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`:**
   - Ensure that during the assignment of the related object to a ForeignKey field, the foreign key field on the parent is invalidated if the related object's primary key is not yet set. This will force a re-evaluation when saving the parent object.

Here's the necessary change for `django/db/models/base.py` and `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`:

- **`django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`:**
  - Update the assignment logic in the `RelatedObject` or `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor` to check if the related object has its primary key set. If not, invalidate the parent object’s foreign key field.

- **`django/db/models/base.py`:**
  - Update the `save` method of the parent model to ensure that it correctly retrieves and sets the foreign key value based on the related object's primary key.

### Changes Needed

#### `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py`

1. Locate the `__set__` method in `ForwardManyToOneDescriptor`.

2. Update the `__set__` method to include logic that invalidates the parent’s foreign key field if the related object's primary key is not set, and sets it correctly when it is.

#### `django/db/models/base.py`

1. Locate the `save` method in the `Model` class.

2. Ensure that before saving the parent model, it updates the foreign key fields based on the current primary key values of the related objects.

By making these changes, you can ensure that when the related object's primary key is set after its assignment to the parent object, the parent object correctly updates its foreign key fields.

Remember, do not modify test case files or create new ones unless necessary. The focus here is on modifying only one file that is most relevant to solving the problem. Ensure thorough testing to confirm that the related bug has been resolved without introducing new issues.
