**Title:** Correct Overescaped Trailing Underscore in Napoleon Attributes

**Problem:**
When using the Sphinx napoleon extension, class attributes with trailing underscores are being overescaped in the generated HTML documentation. This results in a visible backslash before the underscore, which is not the expected behavior.

**Analysis:**
It's common practice in Python to use a trailing underscore to avoid naming conflicts with Python keywords. Sphinx napoleon should correctly handle these trailing underscores without adding a backslash in the rendered output. The issue arises in how napoleon processes and escapes attribute names in the docstrings.

The root cause lies in the `_process_docstring` method in the `napoleon` extension. This method modifies the lines of a docstring in place and needs to handle trailing underscores correctly during this transformation.

**Proposed Changes:**
1. **sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py:**
   - Adjust the `_process_docstring` function to correctly handle trailing underscores without overescaping them.

### Detailed Changes:
1. **sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py**
   - Locate the `_process_docstring` function.
   - Modify the logic where attributes are processed to ensure that trailing underscores are not overescaped.

#### Changes to `sphinx/ext/napoleon/__init__.py`:
- In the `_process_docstring` function, add checks for trailing underscores and handle them appropriately to prevent adding an unnecessary backslash.

By implementing these changes, attributes with trailing underscores in docstrings processed by napoleon will not render incorrectly with a visible backslash in the generated HTML documentation.
