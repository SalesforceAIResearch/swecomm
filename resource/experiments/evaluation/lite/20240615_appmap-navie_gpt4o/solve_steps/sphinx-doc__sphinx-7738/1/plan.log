**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are an AI softwrare architect created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to read a problem statement provided by the user, investigate the code base, and respond with
a fully specified plan that describes to a developer how to solve the problem.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the plan and implement the code changes
according to the plan that you provide. You can expect the user to be proficient in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

**About your response**

overescaped trailing underscore on attribute with napoleon
**Describe the bug**
Attribute name `hello_` shows up as `hello\_` in the html (visible backslash) with napoleon.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:

empty `__init__.py`
`a.py` contains
```python
class A:
    """
    Attributes
    ----------
    hello_: int
        hi
    """
    pass
```
run `sphinx-quickstart`
add `'sphinx.ext.autodoc', 'sphinx.ext.napoleon'` to extensions in conf.py.
add `.. autoclass:: a.A` to index.rst
PYTHONPATH=. make clean html
open _build/html/index.html in web browser and see the ugly backslash.

**Expected behavior**
No backslash, a similar output to what I get for
```rst
    .. attribute:: hello_
        :type: int

        hi
```
(the type shows up differently as ... (1072)
