**Title**: Modify the Q class to handle reverse AND and OR operations with non-Q instances

**Problem**: When combining `Q` objects with `Exists` expressions using `&` (and), the operation is not commutative. While `Exists(...) & Q()` works as expected, `Q(...) & Exists(...)` raises a `TypeError`. This issue arises because the reverse AND (`__rand__`) and OR (`__ror__`) operations are not implemented for non-Q instances within the `Q` class.

**Analysis**: 
The core issue lies in the implementation of the `_combine` method of the `Q` class. Currently, this method only handles objects of type `Q`. When the `other` object is not a `Q` instance, a `TypeError` is raised. 

To fix this problem, we need to customize the behavior of the `__rand__` and `__ror__` methods in the `Q` class to handle non-Q instances like `Exists`. The solution involves defining `__rand__` and `__ror__` methods that can handle those cases by ensuring the operations are commutative.

**Proposed Changes**: We need to modify `django/db/models/query_utils.py`, specifically the `Q` class.

1. **Add `__rand__` Method**:
   - Implement the `__rand__` method to handle cases where the `&` operator is applied with the left operand being a non-`Q` instance. This involves calling the `_combine` method with appropriate arguments.

2. **Add `__ror__` Method**:
   - Implement the `__ror__` method to handle cases where the `|` operator is applied with the left operand being a non-`Q` instance. This involves calling the `_combine` method with appropriate arguments.

### Detailed Description of Changes

File: `django/db/models/query_utils.py`

**1. Add `__rand__` Method**:
- Purpose: Define reverse AND operation.
- Implementation: This method will call `_combine` with the `self.AND` connector and set the `reversed` argument to `True`.

**2. Add `__ror__` Method**:
- Purpose: Define reverse OR operation.
- Implementation: This method will call `_combine` with the `self.OR` connector and set the `reversed` argument to `True`.

### Code Modifications

Add the following methods to the `Q` class:



- **`__rand__` method** will check if the `other` operand is a `Q` instance. If it is, it will perform the `_combine` operation with the `AND` connector and `reversed` set to `True`. If `other` is not a `Q` instance, it will create a new `Q` instance with `other`, and then combine it with `self`.
  
- **`__ror__` method** will follow a similar logic but use the `OR` connector instead.

By adding these methods, the `Q` class will properly support commutative operations with non-`Q` instances like `Exists`. As a result, `Q(...) & Exists(...)` will work as intended, resolving the reported `TypeError`.
