### Title
Fix viewcode to respect `viewcode_enable_epub` setting when generating epub pages

### Problem
The `viewcode` extension in Sphinx generates module pages for epub builds even when the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration setting is set to `False`. This is not the expected behavior, as module pages should not be created for epub outputs by default when this setting is `False`.

### Analysis
The issue stems from the logic within the `doctree_read` function in the `sphinx.ext.viewcode` module. This function is responsible for generating module pages during the build process. The existing logic checks for epub builds but does not fully enforce the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration setting. As a result, module pages are generated even when the setting is `False`.

To address this issue, we need to adjust the logic in the `doctree_read` function to enforce the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting more rigorously. Specifically, when building for epub formats and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, the function should immediately return and not proceed with generating module pages.

### Proposed Changes
Modify the `doctree_read` function in the `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` file:

1. Update the function to enforce the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration setting more explicitly.
2. Add a conditional check to ensure that when building for epub formats and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, the function returns early without generating module pages.

#### Detailed Description of Changes

**File**: `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`
1. Locate the `doctree_read` function, which starts at line 53.
2. Update the logic within this function to enforce the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting.

Current logic:


Modified logic:


By making this change, the function will correctly return early when building for epub formats and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, preventing the generation of module pages for epub builds.

With these focused changes, we ensure that the `viewcode` extension respects the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting as expected, resolving the issue reported.
