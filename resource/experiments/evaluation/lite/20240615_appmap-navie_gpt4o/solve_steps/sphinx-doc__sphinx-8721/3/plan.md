**Title: Ensure `viewcode_enable_epub` Config Flag Prevents Module Page Creation for EPUB**

**Problem**
The Sphinx extension `viewcode` generates module pages for EPUB output even when the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration flag is set to `False`. This is unexpected behavior, as module pages should not be created for EPUB by default when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`.

**Analysis**
The root cause of the issue lies in the `doctree_read` function defined in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`. The flag `viewcode_enable_epub` is correctly checked, and the function returns early if the EPUB builder is active and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`. However, this logic does not prevent the generation of module pages during the `collect_pages` event.

The `collect_pages` function is responsible for generating module pages. This function should also check the `viewcode_enable_epub` flag and skip the generation of pages if the flag is set to `False`.

**Proposed Changes**
To resolve the issue, the `collect_pages` function in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` needs to be modified to include a check for the `viewcode_enable_epub` flag. If the EPUB builder is active and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, the function should return early without generating module pages.

1. **sphinx/ext/viewcode.py**
   - Modify the `collect_pages` function to include a check for the `viewcode_enable_epub` flag.
   - If the EPUB builder is active, and `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`, exit the function without generating any module pages.

**Detailed Changes:**

- **sphinx/ext/viewcode.py: collect_pages**
  - Add a conditional check at the beginning of the `collect_pages` function to verify if the builder is EPUB and `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`.
  - If the condition is met, the function should return early.

By ensuring that both `doctree_read` and `collect_pages` check the `viewcode_enable_epub` flag appropriately, the module pages will not be generated for EPUB output when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.

These changes should be sufficient to resolve the reported bug and align the behavior with the expected functionality.
