### Prevent `viewcode` from Creating Pages for `epub` When `viewcode_enable_epub=False`

#### Problem
The `sphinx.ext.viewcode` extension creates pages for ePub outputs even when the configuration option `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. This behavior persists when running the `make html epub` command.

#### Analysis
The `viewcode` extension should respect the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting and avoid generating module pages when creating epub files if this configuration option is set to `False`. The issue appears to stem from the `doctree_read` function not correctly preventing the creation of ePub pages when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.

The logic designed to check the builder name and `viewcode_enable_epub` option needs to be extended to other parts where `viewcode` pages are generated for ePub outputs.

#### Proposed Changes
Make the following modifications in the `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` file:

1. **Modify the `doctree_read` function:**
   Ensure that the function properly respects the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration setting not only in the existing check but consistently throughout the function.

2. **Update the `collect_pages` function:**
   Prevent the generation of module pages within the `collect_pages` function if the `viewcode_enable_epub` option is set to `False` and the builder is either `epub` or `epub3`.

#### Detailed Description of Changes
**1. Modify the `doctree_read` function:**

Incorporate a conditional check to ensure the logic aligns with the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting for the `epub` output type.

**File:** `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`

- **Modify the Logic to Check `viewcode_enable_epub`:**
  - In the `doctree_read` function, if the builder is `epub` and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, bypass the rest of the function and prevent any further actions.

**2. Update the `collect_pages` function:**

Standardize the proper handling of the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting to prevent page generation for unwanted conditions.

**File:** `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`

- **Exclude Processing for `epub` Builders:**
  - Apply a similar conditional check within the `collect_pages` function to abort page collection based on the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting.

#### Changes Summary:
**1. In `doctree_read` function (near Line 53):**


**2. In `collect_pages` function (near Line 181):**


By incorporating these changes, `viewcode` will respect the `viewcode_enable_epub` setting correctly, ensuring no module pages are generated for `epub` formats when the configuration option is set to `False`.
