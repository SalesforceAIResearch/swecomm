**Title**: Correct Inconsistent Results from diophantine Function with permute=True

**Problem**: The `diophantine` function in `sympy` produces inconsistent results based on the order of variables in its `syms` parameter when the `permute=True` option is used. Specifically, in the below example, the result varies significantly based on the order of variables:



**Analysis**: The root of the issue seems to be in the permutation mechanism within the `diophantine` function. When `permute=True` is set, the function should generate all permutations of solutions involving the given symbols. If the permutations of the symbols are not correctly handled or fully evaluated, it can lead to incomplete results. There might be an underlying function that evaluates these permutations, which needs to be inspected and corrected.

**Proposed Changes**: Modify the logic in the function responsible for handling permutations to ensure all symbol permutations are considered and evaluated. We'll do this in the file `sympy/polys/factortools.py`. We suspect the function `dmp_zz_diophantine` is related to the permutations since it is responsible for solving Diophantine equations.

1. **File**: `sympy/polys/factortools.py`
   - **Function**: `dmp_zz_diophantine`
     - **Change**:
       - Ensure that all permutations of the variable symbols are generated and evaluated.
       - Correct the handling to return complete results regardless of input variable order.

Detailed changes:
1. Add a check and creation of all permutations of `syms` inside the `dmp_zz_diophantine` function.
2. For each permutation, solve the equation and aggregate results.

Approach:
1. Inside the `dmp_zz_diophantine` function, verify if `permute=True`.
2. Generate permutations of the symbols.
3. Evaluate the Diophantine equation for each permutation.
4. Consolidate and ensure the result set covers all permutations.

By ensuring all permutations are considered, the function should yield consistent results regardless of the input symbol order. This solution minimizes changes and targets the core permutation logic in the relevant function.

**Proposed Change Summary**:
1. Modify the `sympy/polys/factortools.py` file.
2. Update the `dmp_zz_diophantine` function to handle permutations comprehensively, ensuring all permutations of symbols are evaluated and consolidated.

Testing: After implementing the changes, run multiple test cases with various permutations of symbols and validate the results. Ensure they match across different orderings when `permute=True`.
