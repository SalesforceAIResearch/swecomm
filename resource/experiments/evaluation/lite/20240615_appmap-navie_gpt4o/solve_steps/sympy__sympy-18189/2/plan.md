### Title: Resolve Inconsistent Diophantine Equation Solutions Due to Symbol Order

### Problem
The `diophantine` function yields incomplete and inconsistent sets of solutions depending on the order of the symbols when `permute=True` is specified. For instance, with `syms=(m,n)` the function returns a complete set of solutions, whereas with `syms=(n,m)` it returns an incomplete set.

### Analysis
The root cause of this discrepancy lies in how the `diophantine` function iterates through permutations of the symbols and different orders of evaluation. When `permute=True`, the function is supposed to explore all possible permutations of the symbols to find all potential solutions. However, the implementation does not handle all permutations effectively, potentially skipping valid solutions when symbols are ordered differently.

The issue likely stems from the permutations not being utilized comprehensively within the algorithmic logic, resulting in early termination or incomplete exploration of the solution space. This behavior necessitates a check and proper handling of all permutations irrespective of the input symbol order.

### Proposed Changes
The focus is on the file `sympy/polys/factortools.py` because it contains relevant functions like `dmp_zz_diophantine` and `dup_zz_diophantine` that are integral to solving Diophantine equations.

#### Changes to `sympy/polys/factortools.py`:
1. **Function: `dmp_zz_diophantine`**
   - **Logic Adjustment**: Ensure that permutations of input symbols are comprehensively handled.
   - **Modification Point**: Before returning the solutions, combine and deduplicate the results from all permutations to ensure completeness.

2. **Function: `dup_zz_diophantine`**
   - **Logic Adjustment**: Similar to `dmp_zz_diophantine`, ensure full permutation handling and explore all possible solutions thoroughly.

3. **Error Checking**:
   - Add checks or assert statements to validate the results for expected completeness, preventing premature termination of solution searches.

### Detailed Description of Modifications:

#### `dmp_zz_diophantine`

- **Before Final Return**:
  Add a loop to iterate through all permutations of the input symbols and recursively call `dmp_zz_diophantine` for each permutation.
  
- **Combine Results**:
  Gather results from all these recursive calls, deduplicate, and ensure that no valid solutions are missed.

#### `dup_zz_diophantine`

- **Permutation Handling**:
  Similar adjustments to handle and process all permutations of the input symbols thoroughly.

By iterating through all permutations and ensuring comprehensive processing, the adjustments will help the `diophantine` function return complete and consistent results.

**Specific code changes will include:**

1. **Sympy/polys/factortools.py - `dmp_zz_diophantine` function**:
   - Iterate and process all symbol permutations before finalizing the solution set.
   
2. **Sympy/polys/factortools.py - `dup_zz_diophantine` function**:
   - Ensure thorough exploration using the permutations of the input symbols.

These changes will address the inconsistency issue and ensure that `diophantine` returns all valid solutions regardless of the initial symbol order.
