**Title:** Fix incomplete results in `diophantine` function with `permute=True` based on symbol order

**Problem:**
The `diophantine` function in the sympy library returns incomplete results when the `permute` argument is set to True and the order of symbols in the `syms` argument is changed. The issue is demonstrated with the expressions `n**4 + m**4 - 2**4 - 3**4`. Depending on the order of `syms`, the results are inconsistent, indicating that some valid solutions are being overlooked.

**Analysis:**
The `diophantine` function is designed to solve Diophantine equations and return all possible integer solutions. When the `permute` argument is set to True, the function should consider all permutations of the symbols provided in `syms`.

The incomplete result issue suggests that the current implementation does not correctly handle permutations of symbols, leading to certain solutions being missed. The core of the issue likely lies in how the permutations are processed and evaluated within the function. Specifically, the function should consistently generate and check all permutations of the symbols and ensure that all valid solutions are included in the final result set.

**Proposed Changes:**
Modify the `diophantine` function in the `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py` file to ensure that all permutations of the symbols are correctly handled and evaluated. 

1. Identify the part of the `diophantine` function that processes permutations of the symbols.
2. Ensure that all permutations of the symbols are generated and iterated over.
3. Collect all unique solutions from each permutation and consolidate them into a single result set.

### Suggested Modifications:

**File:** `sympy/solvers/diophantine.py`

1. **Function:** `diophantine`
   - **Logic Changes:**
     - When `permute=True`, generate all permutations of the symbols in `syms`.
     - For each permutation, solve the equation and collect the results.
     - After iterating through all permutations, combine the results and remove duplicates to form the final result set.

2. **Implementation Details:**
   - Adjust the part of the function where permutations are handled to ensure all are considered.
   - Modify the result collection mechanism to ensure that all unique solutions from different permutations are included in the final set of solutions.

The following steps outline the changes:

1. **Modify the diophantine function:**

   - Identify where the permutations are being processed.
   - Ensure that all permutations of `syms` are being considered.
   - Add logic to merge results from different permutations ensuring no duplicates are present.

By making these changes, the `diophantine` function should correctly handle permutations and return a complete set of solutions regardless of the order of symbols in the input. This will resolve the inconsistency presented in the problem statement.

**Note:** Since the exact code structures vary, ensure to carefully inspect the implementation and apply the logic modifications precisely where the permutation handling is done within the `diophantine` function, ensuring minimal disruption to the existing logic.
