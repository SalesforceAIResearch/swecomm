**Title**: Modify LaTeX Printer to Print Poly Monomials in Logical Order

**Problem**: 
When printing a polynomial (`Poly`), the LaTeX printer does not follow the logical order of monomials (from highest to lowest degrees) as used by the `str` and `pretty` printers. Instead, it prints the monomials in a seemingly arbitrary order.

**Analysis**: 
The root cause of this issue lies in the LaTeX printer's implementation of how it processes and prints the terms of a `Poly` object. The LaTeX printer needs to be adjusted to sort the monomials in the same logical order as the `str` and `pretty` printers before rendering them into LaTeX format. This ensures consistency across different printing methods.

**Proposed Changes**: 
Update the `LatexPrinter` class in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file.

1. **Locate and Modify the `_print_Poly` Method**: 
   - The method responsible for printing `Poly` objects is `_print_Poly`. This method needs to be adjusted to sort the monomials properly before converting them to LaTeX.
   
2. **Implement Sorting**:
   - Before converting and combining the monomials into a LaTeX string, ensure the monomials are sorted in descending order based on their degree.
   
3. **Adjustments for LaTeX Format**:
   - Ensure the logic appropriately handles the LaTeX formatting for the sorted monomials to maintain the correct LaTeX syntax and style.

**Steps to Implement**:

1. **Locate the `_print_Poly` function in `sympy/printing/latex.py`**:
   - Find the method `_print_Poly(self, poly)` inside the LatexPrinter class.

2. **Sort the Monomials**:
   - Modify the method to sort the terms of the polynomial by their degrees in descending order before formatting them.
   - Use the existing methods in SymPy for handling polynomial terms and degrees for this sorting operation.

3. **Adjust the Monomial Formatting**:
   - Ensure that after sorting, the monomials are correctly formatted into LaTeX strings following the desired order.
   - Ensure proper handling of LaTeX-specific symbols and syntax.

4. **Thorough Testing**:
   - Test the modified LaTeX printer with various polynomials to ensure the monomials are printed in the correct order and that the output is properly formatted.

By implementing these changes in `sympy/printing/latex.py`, the LaTeX printer will be aligned with the `str` and `pretty` printers, providing a consistent experience across different printing methods for `Poly` objects.
