**Title**: Update LaTeX printer to use the same order of monomials as pretty and str

**Problem**: LaTeX printer does not use the same order of monomials as pretty and str printers when printing a `Poly`. The `str` and `pretty` printers order the monomials from highest to lowest degrees, while the LaTeX printer does not, leading to inconsistent output among the different printers.

**Analysis**: The primary issue arises from the ordering of monomials in the LaTeX printer when rendering a polynomial expression. The LaTeX printer currently processes and renders monomials in arbitrary order, unlike the `str` and `pretty` printers which process monomials from highest to lowest degrees.

To achieve consistency across all printers, the LaTeX printer should be modified to follow the same ordering logic as the other printers. Specifically, during the conversion and rendering steps, the LaTeX printer should ensure that monomials are sorted in descending order of their degrees.

**Proposed Changes**:
1. **File**: `sympy/printing/latex.py`
   
   **Function**: Modify how the monomials in polynomials are ordered in the `_print_Poly` method.

   **Description**:
   - Ensure that the `_print_Poly` method first sorts the monomials in descending order based on their degrees before rendering them.
   - Adjust the method to mimic the ordering logic used in `str` and `pretty` printers.
   
2. **Relevant Changes in `_print_Poly` method**:
   - Retrieve the list of monomials.
   - Sort the monomials in descending order based on the degree.
   - Render the sorted monomials into LaTeX-compatible format.
   
   The goal is to refactor the `_print_Poly` method to first sort the monomials and then convert the sorted list into the LaTeX string.

In conclusion, modifying the `_print_Poly` method in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file to sort monomials in descending order of their degrees will ensure consistency across the `str`, `pretty`, and `LaTeX` printers in SymPy.
