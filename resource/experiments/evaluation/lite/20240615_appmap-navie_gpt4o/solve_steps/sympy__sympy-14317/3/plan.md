**Title:** Modify LaTeX Printer to Use Same Monomial Order as Pretty and Str Printers

**Problem:**
LaTeX printer does not use the same order of monomials as pretty and str printers. When printing a `Poly`, the `str` and `pretty` printers use the logical order of monomials, from the highest to lowest degrees, but the LaTeX printer does not. This inconsistency needs to be resolved.

**Analysis:**
The inconsistency arises because the LaTeX printer appears to handle the ordering of terms differently from the `str` and `pretty` printers. To resolve this issue, we need to ensure that the LaTeX printer processes and prints the terms in the same order as the `str` and `pretty` printers.

The steps to achieve this are as follows:
1. Investigate how the `str` and `pretty` printers order monomials.
2. Ensure that the LaTeX printer sorts monomials in the same order.
3. Modify the LaTeX printer's code to support this consistent ordering.

The core logic involves iterating through the terms of the polynomial and sorting them in descending order based on their degrees. This sorted list should then be used to construct the LaTeX representation of the polynomial.

**Proposed Changes:**

1. **File:** `sympy/printing/latex.py`
   - Modify the function responsible for printing polynomials (`_print_Poly` or its equivalent).
   - Ensure that the terms of the polynomial are sorted in descending order by degree before they are processed and converted into LaTeX format.
  
   Steps:
   - Extract the terms of the polynomial.
   - Sort these terms in descending order by their degree.
   - Construct the LaTeX string of the polynomial using these ordered terms.

By implementing these changes, the LaTeX printer will produce polynomial representations that are consistent with the `str` and `pretty` printers, providing a unified and logical output across different formats.
