**About you**

Your name is Navie. You are code generation AI created and maintained by AppMap Inc, and are available to AppMap users as a service.

Your job is to generate code and test cases. Like a senior developer or architect, you have a deep understanding of the codebase.

**About the user**

The user is an experienced software developer who will review the generated code and test cases. You can expect the user to be proficient
in software development.

You do not need to explain the importance of programming concepts like planning and testing, as the user is already aware of these.

2ms [prompt] system: **The code generation task**

This is a description of a code enhancement that the user wants you to help them with. Your response should be
focused primarily on solving this issue via code generation.

    ``clash1`` defines all the single letter variables that clash with
    SymPy objects; ``clash2`` defines the multi-letter clashing symbols;
    and ``clash`` is the union of both. These can be passed for ``locals``
    during sympification if one desires Symbols rather than the non-Symbol
    objects for those names.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import S
    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1, _clash2, _clash
    >>> S("Q & C", locals=_clash1)
    And(C, Q)
    >>> S('pi(x)', locals=_clash2)
    pi(x)
    >>> S('pi(C, Q)', locals=_clash)
    pi(C, Q)

3457ms [code-snippet] sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:39-65:  There are two possible types of output. First, if ``evaluate`` flag is
    set, this function will return an expression with collected terms or
    else it will return a dictionary with expressions up to rational powers
    as keys and collected coefficients as values.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import S, collect, expand, factor, Wild
    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, c, x, y, z

    This function can collect symbolic coefficients in polynomials or
    rational expressions. It will manage to find all integer or rational
    powers of collection variable::

        >>> collect(a*x**2 + b*x**2 + a*x - b*x + c, x)
        c + x**2*(a + b) + x*(a - b)

    The same result can be achieved in dictionary form::

        >>> d = collect(a*x**2 + b*x**2 + a*x - b*x + c, x, eva... (908)
3457ms [code-snippet] sympy/simplify/radsimp.py:673-693:  If there are more than ``max_terms`` radical terms then the expression is
    returned unchanged.

    Examples
    ========

    >>> from sympy import radsimp, sqrt, Symbol, denom, pprint, I
    >>> from sympy import factor_terms, fraction, signsimp
    >>> from sympy.simplify.radsimp import collect_sqrt
    >>> from sympy.abc import a, b, c

    >>> radsimp(1/(2 + sqrt(2)))
    (-sqrt(2) + 2)/2
    >>> x,y = map(Symbol, 'xy')
    >>> e = ((2 + 2*sqrt(2))*x + (2 + sqrt(8))*y)/(2 + sqrt(2))
    >>> radsimp(e)
    sqrt(2)*(x + y)

    No simplification beyond removal of the gcd is done. One might
    want to polish the result a little, however, by collecting
    square root terms:

Caveats
=======

1. As of the time of writing this, the names ``C``, ``O``, ``S``, ``I``, ``N``,
``E``, and ``Q`` are colliding with names defined in SymPy. If you import them
from both ``sympy.abc`` and ``sympy``, the second import will "win".
This is an issue only for * imports, which should only be used for short-lived
code such as interactive sessions and throwaway scripts that do not survive
until the next SymPy upgrade, where ``sympy`` may contain a different set of
names.
