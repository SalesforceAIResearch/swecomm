**Title**: Improve `cse` to Handle MatrixSymbol Indexing Properly

**Problem**: The `cse` function in SymPy has inconsistent behavior when dealing with `MatrixSymbol` indexing. Specifically, when performing common subexpression elimination (CSE) on expressions involving `MatrixSymbol` objects, it produces redundant substitutions where entire matrices are copied element-by-element.

**Analysis**: The root cause of this issue lies in the `cse` function's inability to correctly handle `MatrixSymbol` and their indexed elements as separate entities. Instead, it treats the entire matrix's elements as common subexpressions, leading to unnecessary duplication. 

To resolve this, we need to refine the `cse` functionality to accurately recognize and handle the indexing of `MatrixSymbol` objects without generating redundant substitutions. Specifically, when encountered with `MatrixSymbol` elements during CSE, the logic should group index-based operations for these symbols appropriately, and avoid treating the entire matrices as substitutable entities.

**Proposed Changes**: The changes should be focused on the component responsible for scanning and processing the expression tree within `cse_main.py`. Below are the necessary updates:

1. **sympy/simplify/cse_main.py**

   **Modify the `tree_cse` function**:
   - Within the `tree_cse` function, add logic to recognize `MatrixSymbol` and their indexed elements distinctly.
   - Ensure the function does not substitute entire matrices but handles individual matrix elements correctly.

   1. **Handling `MatrixSymbol` Indexing:**
      - Update `_find_repeated` and `_rebuild` functions to treat individual `MatrixSymbol` indexed elements as unique subexpressions.
      - Implement a helper function to process matrix elements and ensure proper grouping.

   **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Line ~45 (opt_cse function definition)**: Ensure matrix indexing is processed correctly by adding specific checks for `MatrixSymbol`.

   - **Line ~570 (tree_cse function definition)**:
     - Locate the point where subexpressions are identified and temporary symbols are generated.
     - Add logic in `_find_repeated` to treat `expr[i, j]` (for `MatrixSymbol`) as the primary subexpression unit.
     
   - **Line ~640**:
     - Ensure the `reduced_exprs` correctly reflect substitutions at the element level without duplicating entire matrices.
   
   - **Additional Changes**:
     - Utilize `MatrixSymbol`'s shape property to appropriately handle the dimensions.
     - Introduce any additional data structures or helper functions if required to facilitate the new logic.

**sympy/simplify/cse_main.py**
- **Modify**: Modify `tree_cse` function to recognize and handle `MatrixSymbol` indexed elements.
- **Enhance**: Introduce necessary checks within `_find_repeated` and `_rebuild` to handle indexing appropriately.
- **Adjust**: Ensure the reduced expressions list (`reduced_exprs`) accurately represents processed elements without unnecessary duplication.

With these changes, the behavior of `cse` with `MatrixSymbol` indexing should align correctly, eliminating redundant substitutions of entire matrices while retaining efficient processing of indexed elements.

Note: Ensure thorough testing after implementing these changes to verify correctness and performance improvements.
