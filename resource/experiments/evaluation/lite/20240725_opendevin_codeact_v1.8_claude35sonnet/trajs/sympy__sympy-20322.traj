If\r\n421|    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\r\n422|    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\r\n423|    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\r\n424|    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\r\n425|    will be robust.\r\n426|\r\n427|    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\r\n428|    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\r\n429|    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\r\n430|    example:\r\n431|\r\n432|    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\r\n433|    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\r\n434|    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\r\n435|    >>> a\r\n436|    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\r\n437|    >>> simplify(a)\r\n438|    x + 1\r\n439|\r\n440|    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\r\n441|    simplification functions:\r\n442|\r\n443|    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\r\n444|    >>> trigsimp(a)\r\n445|    (x**2 + x)/x\r\n446|    >>> cancel(_)\r\n447|    x + 1\r\n448|\r\n449|    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\r\n450|    complicated expression. The default ``ratio=1.7`` prevents more extreme\r\n451|    cases: if (result length)/(input length) > ratio, then input is returned\r\n452|    unmodified.  The ``measure`` parameter lets you specify the function used\r\n453|    to determine how complex an expression is.  The function should take a\r\n454|    single argument as an expression and return a number such that if\r\n455|    expression ``a`` is more complex than expression ``b``, then\r\n456|    ``measure(a) > measure(b)``.  The default measure function is\r\n457|    :func:`~.count_ops`, which returns the total number of operations in the\r\n458|    expression.\r\n459|\r\n460|    For example, if ``ratio=1``, ``simplify`` output can't be longer\r\n461|    than input.\r\n462|\r\n463|    ::\r\n(1704 more lines below)\r\n",

In the following,\r\n+    the ``bitcount`` function is treated as a symbol and the ``O`` is\r\n+    interpreted as the Order object (used with series) and it raises\r\n+    an error when used improperly:\r\n+\r\n+    >>> s = 'bitcount(42)'\r\n+    >>> sympify(s)\r\n+    bitcount(42)\r\n+    >>> sympify(\"O(x)\")\r\n+    O(x)\r\n+    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\")\r\n+    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n+    ...\r\n+    TypeError: unbound method...\r\n+\r\n+    In order to have ``bitcount`` be recognized it can be imported into a\r\n+    namespace dictionary and passed as locals:\r\n+\r\n+    >>> from sympy.core.compatibility import exec_\r\n+    >>> ns = {}\r\n+    >>> exec_('from sympy.core.evalf import bitcount', ns)\r\n+    >>> sympify(s, locals=ns)\r\n+    6\r\n+\r\n+    In order to have the ``O`` interpreted as a Symbol, identify it as such\r\n+    in the namespace dictionary. This can be done in a variety of ways; all\r\n+    three of the following are possibilities:\r\n+\r\n+    >>> from sympy import Symbol\r\n+    >>> ns[\"O\"] = Symbol(\"O\")  # method 1\r\n+    >>> exec_('from sympy.abc import O', ns)  # method 2\r\n+    >>> ns.update(dict(O=Symbol(\"O\")))  # method 3\r\n+    >>> sympify(\"O + 1\", locals=ns)\r\n+    O + 1\r\n+\r\n+    If you want *all* single-letter and Greek-letter variables to be symbols\r\n+    then you can use the clashing-symbols dictionaries that have been defined\r\n+    there as private variables: _clash1 (single-letter variables), _clash2\r\n+    (the multi-letter Greek names) or _clash (both single and multi-letter\r\n+    names that are defined in abc).\r\n+\r\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import _clash1\r\n+    >>> _clash1\r\n+    {'C': C, 'E': E, 'I': I, 'N': N, 'O': O, 'Q': Q, 'S': S}\r\n+    >>> sympify('I & Q', _clash1)\r\n+    I & Q\r\n+\r\n+    Strict\r\n+    ------\r\n+\r\n+    If the option ``strict`` is set to ``True``, only the types for which an\r\n+    explicit conversion has been defined are converted. In the other\r\n+    cases, a SympifyError is raised.\r\n+\r\n+    >>> print(sympify(None))\r\n+    None\r\n+    >>> sympify(None, strict=True)\r\n+    Traceback (most recent call last):\r\n+    ...\r\n+    SympifyError: SympifyError: None\r\n+\r\n+    Evaluation\r\n+    ----------\r\n+\r\n+    If the option ``evaluate`` is set to ``False``, then arithmetic and\r\n+    operators will be converted into their SymPy equivalents and the\r\n+    ``evaluate=False`` option will be added. Nested ``Add`` or ``Mul`` will\r\n+    be denested first. This is done via an AST transformation that replaces\r\n+    operators with their SymPy equivalents, so if an operand redefines any\r\n+    of those operations, the redefined operators will not be used. If\r\n+    argument a is not a string, the mathematical expression is evaluated\r\n+    before being passed to sympify, so adding evaluate=False will still\r\n+    return the evaluated result of expression.\r\n+\r\n+    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5')\r\n+    19/3\r\n+    >>> sympify('2**2 / 3 + 5', evaluate=False)\r\n+    2**2/3 + 5\r\n+    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=True)\r\n+    9\r\n+    >>> sympify('4/2+7', evaluate=False)\r\n+    4/2 + 7\r\n+    >>> sympify(4/2+7, evaluate=False)\r\n+    9.00000000000000\r\n+\r\n+    Extending\r\n+    ---------\r\n+\r\n+    To extend ``sympify`` to convert custom objects (not derived from ``Basic``),\r\n+    just define a ``_sympy_`` method to your class. You can do that even to\r\n+    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\r\n+\r\n+    >>> from sympy import Matrix\r\n+    >>> class MyList1(object):\r\n+    ...     def __iter__(self):\r\n+    ...         yield 1\r\n+    ...         yield 2\r\n+    ...         return\r\n+    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\r\n+    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\r\n+    >>> sympify(MyList1())\r\n+    Matrix([\r\n+    [1],\r\n+    [2]])\r\n+\r\n+    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\r\n+    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\r\n+    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\r\n+    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\r\n+\r\n+    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\r\n+    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\r\n+    ...         yield 1\r\n+    ...         yield 2\r\n+    ...         return\r\n+    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\r\n+    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\r\n+    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\r\n+    >>> sympify(MyList2())\r\n+    Matrix([\r\n+    [1],\r\n+    [2]])\r\n+\r\n+    Notes\r\n+    =====\r\n+\r\n+    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\r\n+    when the input is a string.\r\n+\r\n+    convert_xor\r\n+    -----------\r\n+\r\n+    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\r\n+    x**y\r\n+    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\r\n+    x ^ y\r\n+\r\n+    rational\r\n+    --------\r\n+\r\n+    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\r\n+    0.1\r\n+    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\r\n+    1/10\r\n+\r\n+    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\r\n+    that are very different in structure than what was entered. Until such\r\n+    autosimplification is no longer done, the ``kernS`` function might be of\r\n+    some use.
