# Cosine Genie v20240725

Cosine Genie is the world's most capable software engineering AI model, achieving a state-of-the-art score of 30.08% on the SWE-Bench evaluation and 50.67% on SWE-Lite. Developed by Cosine, Genie is designed to emulate the cognitive processes of human engineers, allowing it to tackle complex problems with unprecedented accuracy and efficiency.

## Key Features

- **State-of-the-Art Performance**: Genie scores 30.08% on SWE-Bench, and 50.67% on SWE-Lite.
- **Enhanced Reasoning and Planning**: Trained on proprietary data that codifies human reasoning, representing perfect information lineage, incremental knowledge discovery, and step-by-step decision making derived from real examples of software engineers doing their jobs.
- **High Retrieval Accuracy**: Genie achieved a retrieval accuracy of 64.27%, successfully identifying 91,475 out of 142,338 required lines of code.
- **Wide Language Support**: Trained on a diverse mix of programming languages including JavaScript, Python, TypeScript, TSX, Java, C#, C++, C, Rust, Scala, Kotlin, Swift, Golang, PHP, and Ruby.

## Training and Architecture

Genie was trained on billions of tokens of data using a long context OpenAI model, allowing it to process substantial amounts of information. The model leverages a mix of languages and task types to maximize its competence, focusing on the languages most relevant to our users.

## Inference Process

Genie's inference loop comprises four main processes: planning, retrieval, code writing, and code running. This agentic loop allows Genie to react logically to various scenarios, similar to how a human engineer would.

## Future Plans

We are continuously refining Genie by expanding our dataset and introducing new capabilities. Our plans include:
- Enhancing proficiency in more programming languages and frameworks.
- Developing a family of models for different tasks.
- Fine-tuning Genie on specific codebases for enterprise use.
