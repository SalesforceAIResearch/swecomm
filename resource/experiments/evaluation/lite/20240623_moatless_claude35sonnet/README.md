# Moatless Tools
Moatless Tools is a hobby project where I experiment with some ideas I have about how LLMs can be used to edit code in large existing codebases. I believe that rather than relying on an agent to reason its way to a solution, it is  crucial to build good tools to insert the right context into the prompt and  handle the response.

I've been focused on keeping costs down, and on average, each instance costs $0.15 to run on Claude 3.5 Sonnet . Each run is saved as a trajectory (in the `/trajs` folder), and you can check these out to get a better idea of what's happening under the hood.
