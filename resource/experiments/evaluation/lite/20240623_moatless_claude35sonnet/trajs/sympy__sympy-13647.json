The issue is related to the col_insert() method of matrices in SymPy.\n2. The main implementation of matrices is in the MatrixBase class.\n3. The col_insert() method is defined in the MatrixShaping class, which is inherited by MatrixBase.\n4. There are also specific implementations for different matrix types (DenseMatrix and SparseMatrix).\n\nLet's focus on the relevant code:\n\n1. In sympy/matrices/common.py, we find the MatrixShaping class with the col_insert() method:\n   - This is the main implementation of col_insert() that other matrix types use.\n   - The method calls self._eval_col_insert(pos, other) to perform the actual insertion.\n\n2. In sympy/matrices/dense.py, we have the DenseMatrix class:\n   - This is likely the type of matrix used in the reported issue (since it's using sympy.eye()).\n   - However, there's no specific _eval_col_insert() method defined here.\n\n3. In sympy/matrices/sparse.py, we find the SparseMatrix class with a specific _eval_col_insert() method:\n   - This implementation is different from what we're looking for, as it's for sparse matrices.\n\n4. The MatrixBase class in sympy/matrices/matrices.py inherits from MatrixShaping, so it uses the implementation from common.py.\n\nGiven this analysis, the most relevant code for the reported issue is the col_insert() method and the _eval_col_insert() method in the MatrixShaping class in sympy/matrices/common.py.

The _eval_col_insert method contains the core logic for how columns are inserted, which is likely where the bug is located.\n\nGiven that the issue mentions a recent matrix refactor, it's possible that changes in this file have introduced the bug. The current implementation seems to be creating a new matrix with the inserted columns, but there might be an error in how it's calculating the new entries.\n\nSince we have located the exact method (col_insert) and its implementation, including the helper method (_eval_col_insert) that performs the actual insertion, I believe we have all the relevant code needed to investigate and potentially fix this issue.\n\nNo further code search is necessary, as the problem is likely contained within these methods.
