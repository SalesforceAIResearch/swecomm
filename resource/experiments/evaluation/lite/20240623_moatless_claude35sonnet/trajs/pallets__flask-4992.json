  "initial_message": "Add a file mode parameter to flask.Config.from_file()\nPython 3.11 introduced native TOML support with the `tomllib` package. This could work nicely with the `flask.Config.from_file()` method as an easy way to load TOML config files:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load)\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, `tomllib.load()` takes an object readable in binary mode, while `flask.Config.from_file()` opens a file in text mode, resulting in this error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nTypeError: File must be opened in binary mode, e.g. use `open('foo.toml', 'rb')`\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe can get around this with a more verbose expression, like loading from a file opened with the built-in `open()` function and passing the `dict` to `app.Config.from_mapping()`:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n# We have to repeat the path joining that from_file() does\r\nwith open(os.path.join(app.config.root_path, \"config.toml\"), \"rb\") as file:\r\n    app.config.from_mapping(tomllib.load(file))\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut adding a file mode parameter to `flask.Config.from_file()` would enable the use of a simpler expression. E.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\napp.config.from_file(\"config.toml\", tomllib.load, mode=\"b\")\r\n```\r\n\n",
