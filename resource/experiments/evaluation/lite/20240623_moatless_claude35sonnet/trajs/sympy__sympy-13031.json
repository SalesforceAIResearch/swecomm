The search results show code from the file \"sympy/matrices/common.py\", which is likely the core implementation of matrix operations in SymPy.\n\n2. The `MatrixShaping` class is defined in this file, which contains the `hstack` method. This is directly relevant to the reported issue.\n\n3. The `hstack` method is implemented as a classmethod, which matches the usage in the reported issue (sy.Matrix.hstack).\n\n4. The implementation of `hstack` is as follows:\n   ```python\n   @classmethod\n   def hstack(cls, *args):\n       if len(args) == 0:\n           return cls._new()\n\n       kls = type(args[0])\n       return reduce(kls.row_join, args)\n   ```\n\n5. This implementation doesn't explicitly handle the case of empty matrices (0x0, 0x1, 0x2, etc.) as mentioned in the reported issue. It simply uses `reduce` with the `row_join` method of the first argument's class.\n\n6. The behavior change described in the issue is likely due to a change in how `row_join` handles empty matrices, rather than in the `hstack` method itself.\n\n7. However, this `hstack` implementation is crucial to understanding the issue, as it's the entry point for the operation that's behaving differently.\n\nGiven this analysis, I believe the `hstack` method in the `MatrixShaping` class is highly relevant to the reported issue. While it may not be the direct cause of the behavior change, it's the main method involved in the described operation and would be a starting point for investigating and potentially fixing the issue.\n",

The issue is specifically about the `hstack` method of Matrix class.\n2. In the file_context, we can see the `hstack` method defined in the `MatrixShaping` class.\n3. The `hstack` method uses the `row_join` method to combine matrices.\n4. In the search results, we find the `row_join` method implementation in both `MatrixShaping` and `MutableSparseMatrix` classes.\n\nLet's focus on the `row_join` method in `MatrixShaping` class, as it's directly related to the `hstack` method:\n\n```python\ndef row_join(self, other):\n    if self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:\n        return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)\n\n    if self.rows != other.rows:\n        raise ShapeError(\n            \"`self` and `rhs` must have the same number of rows.\")\n    return self._eval_row_join(other)\n```\n\nThis implementation seems to be the root cause of the behavior change. The first condition:\n\n```python\nif self.cols == 0 and self.rows != other.rows:\n    return self._new(other.rows, 0, []).row_join(other)\n```\n\nThis condition is likely causing the unexpected behavior when dealing with matrices that have 0 columns. It creates a new matrix with the same number of rows as the 'other' matrix and 0 columns, then performs row_join with 'other'.\n\nThis explains why in sympy 1.1:\n```python\nM1 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 0)\nM2 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 1)\nM3 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 2)\nM4 = sy.Matrix.zeros(0, 3)\nsy.Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4).shape\n```\nreturns `(0, 3)` instead of `(0, 6)`.\n\nThe relevant code spans are in the `MatrixShaping` class, specifically the `hstack` and `row_join` methods.",
