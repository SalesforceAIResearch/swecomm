LaTeX Printing:\nThe relevant code for LaTeX printing is in the `sympy/printing/latex.py` file, specifically in the `LatexPrinter` class. The `_print_Poly` method is responsible for printing Poly objects in LaTeX format.\n\n2. String Printing:\nThe relevant code for string printing is in the `sympy/printing/str.py` file, in the `StrPrinter` class. The `_print_Poly` method handles the printing of Poly objects as strings.\n\n3. Comparison:\n- The `StrPrinter._print_Poly` method iterates through the terms of the polynomial in order, maintaining the logical order from highest to lowest degrees. It builds the string representation term by term.\n- The `LatexPrinter._print_Poly` method, however, doesn't handle the ordering of terms directly. Instead, it calls `poly.as_expr()` and then prints the resulting expression.\n\n4. Identified Issue:\nThe problem lies in the `LatexPrinter._print_Poly` method. It doesn't maintain the order of monomials because it relies on `poly.as_expr()`, which might not preserve the original order of terms.\n\n5. Relevant Code Spans:\n- The `LatexPrinter._print_Poly` method in `sympy/printing/latex.py` is the main point where the issue occurs.\n- The `StrPrinter._print_Poly` method in `sympy/printing/str.py` serves as a reference for the correct implementation that maintains the order.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll identify the relevant code spans for addressing this issue.",

The issue is about the order of monomials in Poly printing.\n2. We need to compare the implementations of Poly printing in LatexPrinter and StrPrinter.\n\nStrPrinter._print_Poly:\n- This method iterates through the terms of the polynomial using `expr.terms()`.\n- It builds the string representation maintaining the order of terms.\n\nLatexPrinter._print_Poly:\n- This method doesn't iterate through the terms directly.\n- It uses `poly.as_expr()` to get the expression and then prints it.\n\nThe difference in behavior likely stems from how `as_expr()` is implemented in the Poly class:\n\nPoly.as_expr:\n- This method uses `basic_from_dict(f.rep.to_sympy_dict(), *gens)`.\n- The order of terms in the resulting expression might not be preserved.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the LatexPrinter._print_Poly method to use a similar approach as StrPrinter._print_Poly, iterating through the terms to maintain the order.\n\nRelevant code spans:\n1. LatexPrinter._print_Poly in sympy/printing/latex.py\n2. StrPrinter._print_Poly in sympy/printing/str.py\n3. Poly.as_expr in sympy/polys/polytools.py\n4.
