The problem seems to be in the Django's migration writer, which is not properly including the necessary import for 'models'. Let's start by searching for relevant code in the migration writer and related files.\n\n1. First, we'll search for the MigrationWriter class, which is likely responsible for generating the migration file content.\n2. Then, we'll look for any code related to import statement generation or model references in migrations.\n3. We'll also search for the CreateModel operation, as it's mentioned in the generated migration and might be related to the issue.\n\nLet's start with these searches:",

            "scratch_pad": "Let's analyze the issue and the search results step by step:\n\n1. The reported issue is about a missing import statement in a generated migration file, specifically for the 'models' module.\n\n2. The error occurs in the migration file, where it's trying to use 'models.Model' in the 'bases' parameter of the CreateModel operation.\n\n3. Looking at the search results, we need to focus on the MigrationWriter class in the django/db/migrations/writer.py file, as this is responsible for generating the migration files.\n\n4. In the MigrationWriter.as_string method, we can see the logic for generating the migration file content. There's a specific part that handles imports:\n\n   ```python\n   if \"from django.db import models\" in imports:\n       imports.discard(\"from django.db import models\")\n       imports.add(\"from django.db import migrations, models\")\n   else:\n       imports.add(\"from django.db import migrations\")\n   ```\n\n5. This code is supposed to ensure that both 'migrations' and 'models' are imported from django.db. However, it seems that in some cases, particularly when 'models' is only used in the 'bases' parameter, this import might be missed.\n\n6. The CreateModel operation in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py uses 'models.Model' as a default base class, which requires the 'models' import.\n\nBased on this analysis, the relevant code spans are:\n\n1. In django/db/migrations/writer.py:\n   - The MigrationWriter.as_string method, particularly the import handling section.\n\n2. In django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:\n   - The CreateModel class, which uses 'models.Model' as a default base.\n\nThese code spans are crucial to understanding and potentially fixing the issue of the missing 'models' import in generated migration files.",

The issue is likely in the MigrationWriter class in the django/db/migrations/writer.py file.\n\nThe MigrationWriter class is responsible for generating the content of migration files. The as_string method in this class handles the generation of import statements and other parts of the migration file.\n\nThe relevant part of the code is:\n\n```python\nif \"from django.db import models\" in imports:\n    imports.discard(\"from django.db import models\")\n    imports.add(\"from django.db import migrations, models\")\nelse:\n    imports.add(\"from django.db import migrations\")\n```\n\nThis code snippet is responsible for adding the necessary import statements. However, it seems that in some cases, particularly when dealing with custom model bases or mixins (as in the reported issue), the \"from django.db import models\" might not be in the imports set, causing the else clause to be executed. This results in only \"from django.db import migrations\" being added, which explains why 'models' is not defined in the generated migration.\n\nThe CreateModel operation in django/db/migrations/operations/models.py is also relevant, as it handles the creation of new models in migrations, including the handling of bases. However, the issue seems to be more related to the import generation in the MigrationWriter class.\n\nGiven this analysis, I believe we have identified the relevant code and the likely cause of the issue. The fix would involve modifying the import generation logic in the MigrationWriter class to ensure that 'models' is always imported when needed, especially when dealing with custom model bases or mixins.\n\nNo further code search is necessary as we have located the core of the issue in the migration writer.",
