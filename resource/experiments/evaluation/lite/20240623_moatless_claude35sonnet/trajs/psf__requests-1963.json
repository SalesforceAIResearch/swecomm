The issue is about `Session.resolve_redirects` method copying the original request for all subsequent requests, which can cause incorrect method selection.\n\n2. The search results contain the `SessionRedirectMixin` class with the `resolve_redirects` method, which is directly related to the reported issue.\n\n3. Key elements to look for:\n   - Handling of different redirect status codes (303, 307)\n   - Method selection based on redirect type\n   - Copying of the original request\n\n4. Analyzing the `resolve_redirects` method:\n   - The method iterates through redirects (while loop)\n   - It copies the original request at the beginning of each iteration: `prepared_request = req.copy()`\n   - It handles different status codes and changes the method accordingly:\n     - 303 (See Other): Changes method to GET\n     - 302 (Found): Changes method to GET\n     - 301 (Moved): Changes POST to GET\n   - It doesn't explicitly handle 307 (Temporary Redirect) to preserve the original method\n\n5. The issue describes a scenario where a 303 redirect is followed by a 307 redirect. The current implementation would indeed cause an incorrect method selection because it copies the original request at the beginning of each iteration, potentially overwriting the method change from the previous redirect.\n\nBased on this analysis, the entire `resolve_redirects` method is relevant to the reported issue. I'll identify this span as relevant.\n",

The relevant code for this issue is indeed present in the `resolve_redirects` method.\n\nKey observations:\n1. The method starts by copying the original request: `prepared_request = req.copy()`\n2.

The `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class has been updated to preserve the HTTP method changes during the redirection chain.\n\nThe main changes made are:\n\n1. Removed the line that copied the original request at the beginning of each iteration.\n2. Created a new `PreparedRequest` object and prepared it with the current request's properties.\n3. Updated the `method` variable to use `prepared_request.method` instead of `req.method`.\n\nThese changes ensure that the HTTP method is preserved correctly throughout the redirection chain, particularly after a 303 See Other redirect.\n\nNow, let's verify if any further modifications are needed or if we can finish the task.",
