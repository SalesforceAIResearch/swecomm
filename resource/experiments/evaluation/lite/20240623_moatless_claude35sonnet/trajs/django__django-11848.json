The issue is about the `parse_http_date` function in `django.utils.http`, specifically regarding the two-digit year check.\n\n2. In the search results, we can see the `parse_http_date` function in the `django/utils/http.py` file. This is the exact function we need to focus on.\n\n3. The problematic part of the code is within this function, specifically:\n\n   ```python\n   if year < 100:\n       if year < 70:\n           year += 2000\n       else:\n           year += 1900\n   ```\n\n   This is the hard-coded logic mentioned in the issue description, where years 0-69 are considered to be 2000-2069, and 70-99 are considered to be 1970-1999.\n\n4. The entire `parse_http_date` function is relevant because it contains the context for parsing HTTP dates, including the problematic year conversion.\n\n5. The `RFC850_DATE` regex constant is also relevant, as it's used to match dates with two-digit years:\n\n   ```python\n   RFC850_DATE = re.compile(r'^\\w{6,9}, %s-%s-%s %s GMT$' % (__D, __M, __Y2, __T))\n   ```\n\n   Here, `__Y2` is defined earlier as `r'(?P<year>\\d{2})'`, which captures the two-digit year.\n\n6. The `parse_http_date_safe` function is a wrapper around `parse_http_date`, so it's indirectly affected by this issue and should be included for context.\n\nBased on this analysis, we should identify the entire `parse_http_date` function, the `RFC850_DATE` constant, and the `parse_http_date_safe` function as relevant to the reported issue.",
