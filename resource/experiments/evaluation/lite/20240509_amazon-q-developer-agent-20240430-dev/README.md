# Amazon Q Developer Agent v20240430-dev

Amazon Q Developer Agent for feature development (Q Dev Agent) is an AI-powered coding assistant
developed by Amazon's *Next Gen Developer Experience* (NGDE) team. Q Dev Agent's performance has
been measured against the SWE-bench dataset using a development version of the service that bypasses
the planning phase (described below) to enable batch processing of samples without user input.

Q Dev Agent automatically implements multi-file features, bug fixes, and unit tests in your
Integrated Development Environment's (IDE) workspace using natural language input. After you enter
your query, Q Dev Agent analyses your code base and formulates a plan to fulfill the request. You
can accept the plan or ask the AI to iterate on it. Once the plan is validated, Q Dev Agent
generates the code changes needed to implement the feature you requested. Q Dev Agent uses
generative AI to deliver state-of-the-art accuracy for all developers.

Our team is currently working on publishing details of the Q Dev Agent algorithm.
