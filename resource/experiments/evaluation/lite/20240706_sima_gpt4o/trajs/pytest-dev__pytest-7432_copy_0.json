The expected behavior is that the skip location should point to the test item itself, but with `--runxfail`, it points to an internal line in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. The hint suggests that the bug is in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook within `src/_pytest/skipping.py`.\n\nThe search results include the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook implementation in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`. This code span is highly relevant to the issue because it directly involves the logic for generating test reports, including handling skipped and xfailed tests. The specific part of the code that adjusts the report location for skipped tests is:\n\n```python\nelif (\n    item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True)\n    and rep.skipped\n    and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple\n):\n    # skipped by mark.skipif; change the location of the failure\n    # to point to the item definition, otherwise it will display\n    # the location of where the skip exception was raised within pytest\n    _, _, reason = rep.longrepr\n    filename, line = item.reportinfo()[:2]\n    assert line is not None\n    rep.longrepr = str(filename), line + 1, reason\n```\n\nThis block is likely where the issue needs to be addressed, ensuring that the presence of `--runxfail` does not interfere with the location reporting for skipped tests.",
