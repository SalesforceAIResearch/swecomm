The migration executor should only add the outer BEGIN/COMMIT if the migration is atomic and the schema editor can rollback DDL. The current `sqlmigrate` logic only considers `migration.atomic` and needs to be updated to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\n### Context Review\nNo relevant code has been identified yet.\n\n### Search Results Analysis\n\n#### File: django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py\n- **Span: Command.handle**: This span shows the `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is assigned to `migration.atomic`. This is directly relevant to the issue as it needs to be updated to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` as well.\n\n#### File: django/db/migrations/executor.py\n- **Span: MigrationExecutor.collect_sql**: This span shows the `collect_sql` method which uses `self.connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True, atomic=migration.atomic)` to determine if the schema editor should be atomic. This is indirectly relevant as it shows how the atomic property is used but does not need to be modified directly.\n\n#### File: django/db/backends/base/features.py\n- **Span: BaseDatabaseFeatures**: This span shows the `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class where `can_rollback_ddl` is defined. This is relevant as it shows the property that needs to be checked in `sqlmigrate`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe relevant spans are:\n- `Command.handle` in `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py` for updating the logic to consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n- `BaseDatabaseFeatures` in `django/db/backends/base/features.py` for reference to `can_rollback_ddl` property.\n\nThe search task is complete as we have identified the necessary spans to address the issue.",
