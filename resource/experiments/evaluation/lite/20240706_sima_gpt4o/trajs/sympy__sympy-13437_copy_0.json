The `heuristics` function also seems relevant for handling limits at infinity, and it mentions `fibonacci` in a similar context.\n\nIn `sympy/series/gruntz.py`, the `limitinf` function appears highly relevant as it handles limits at infinity and has logic for returning infinity based on the sign of leading terms.\n\nIn `sympy/core/expr.py`, the `Expr` class has a `limit` method that calls `limit` from `sympy/series/limits.py`. The `as_leading_term` method is also relevant as it helps in determining the leading term for limits.\n\nTo fix the issue, the approach will likely involve adding a check for `bell` in these limit handling functions and ensuring that `bell(n)` behaves correctly when `n` approaches infinity.\n",
