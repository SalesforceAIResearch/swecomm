Specifically, the function under different conditions outputs different results.\n\nGiven that the 'apart' function is likely to be defined and implemented within the library, it makes sense to start our search within the `sympy` library. Relevant files from the context include those related to polynomial fractions, solutions, multiplications, series, integrals, expressions, functions, arithmetic simplifications, and basic operations in SymPy.\n\nMy initial search will focus on the function `apart` and examining its implementation and usage within the potential files related to this issue. This initial search will help narrow down where the issue might be coming from.\n\nSome provided files have relevant implementations based on their filenames, such as `partfrac.py` and potentially others.",
