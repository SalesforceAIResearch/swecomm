If you pass in a list of hook functions per hook the code in Request.**init**() will wrap the list in a list which then fails when the hooks are consumed (since a list is not callable).  This is especially annoying since you can not use multiple hooks from a session.  The only way to get multiple hooks now is to create the request object without sending it, then call .register_hook() multiple times and then finally call .send().\n\nThis would all be much easier if Request.**init**() parsed the hooks parameter in a way that it accepts lists as it's values.\n\n",
