In the current analysis, focus was on the 'django/core/management/commands/inspectdb.py' file as it contains the core logic for the inspectdb command.\n\nThe following code spans in 'inspectdb.py' are important for introspecting database tables and generating Django models:\n\n1. <span id='Command'>: This span contains the Command class which is the entry point for the inspectdb command.\n2. <span id='Command.handle_inspection'>: This span contains the handle_inspection method where the database tables are inspected and Django model code is generated. Relevant logic related to ForeignKey and OneToOneField generation is present here.\n3. <span id='Command.normalize_col_name'>: This span contains the normalize_col_name method which is responsible for normalizing column names, relevant for identifying and normalizing relation fields.\n4. <span id='Command.get_meta'>: This span contains the get_meta method which generates the Meta class for the models based on the table constraints, which is relevant for ensuring uniqueness and avoiding conflicts.\n\nTo address the reported issue, modifications will likely be needed in the 'handle_inspection' method to include the related_name attribute for ForeignKey and OneToOneField when the related model has conflicting field names.
