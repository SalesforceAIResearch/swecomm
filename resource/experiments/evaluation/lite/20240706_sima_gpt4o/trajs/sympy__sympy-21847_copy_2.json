This function should generate all monomials such that the total degree is between `min_degrees` and `max_degrees`, but it currently only returns monomials where the degree of each variable is at least the corresponding entry in `min_degrees`.\n\n### Relevant Code Spans\n\n1. **File:** `sympy/polys/monomials.py`\n   **Span ID:** `itermonomials`\n   **Reasoning:** This span contains the definition of the `itermonomials` function, which is directly related to the issue. The logic within this function needs to be examined and potentially modified to ensure it includes monomials with the correct total degree when `min_degrees` is specified.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe code span `itermonomials` in `sympy/polys/monomials.py` is highly relevant to the reported issue as it directly contains the logic for generating monomials with a given degree range.",
