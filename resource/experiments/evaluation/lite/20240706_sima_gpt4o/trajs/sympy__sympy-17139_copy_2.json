This is directly relevant as it involves the comparison of exponents which might be complex.\n   - `TR6` function: This function calls `_TR56` with `cos` as the function for simplification. This is directly involved in the simplification process of `cos(x)**I`.\n\n2. **sympy/simplify/simplify.py**\n   - `simplify` function: This is the main function that is called to simplify the expression. It eventually calls `trigsimp`, which leads to the error.\n   - `bottom_up` function: This function is used for recursive simplification and is called within `_TR56` and `simplify`.\n\n## Identified Code Spans\n\n### sympy/simplify/fu.py\n- `_TR56` function (span id: `_TR56`)\n- `TR6` function (span id: `TR6`)\n\n### sympy/simplify/simplify.py\n- `simplify` function (span id: `simplify`)\n- `bottom_up` function (span id: `bottom_up`)\n\n# Conclusion\nThe identified code spans are relevant to the reported issue and provide the necessary context to understand and address the invalid comparison of complex numbers.",
