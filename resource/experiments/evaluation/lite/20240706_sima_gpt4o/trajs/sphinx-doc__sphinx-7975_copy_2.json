Modifications here may be necessary to handle the correct linking of 'Symbols' sections.\n\nThe following files and code spans are less relevant but still worth noting for potential indirect reference or context:\n\n3. **sphinx/writers/html.py**\n   - Span `HTMLTranslator`: This class handles HTML translation but doesn't appear directly relevant to the sorting issue.\n   - Span `HTMLTranslator.visit_index`: This function raises `nodes.SkipNode` for index nodes, which might be relevant for skipping certain nodes, but doesn't appear directly connected to the creation or sorting of index entries.\n\n4. **sphinx/util/nodes.py**\n   - Span `process_index_entry`: This function processes individual index entries, but the primary issue seems to be with how entries are grouped and written, not how they're individually processed.\n\nTaking these insights into account, the primary focus for addressing the issue should be on the `IndexEntries.create_index` method and the `StandaloneHTMLBuilder.write_genindex` function.",
