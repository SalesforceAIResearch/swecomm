In `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`:\n   - The `Documenter` class and its `filter_members` method are relevant. The `filter_members` method processes members of a module and decides which ones to keep based on various criteria. This is likely where the logic should be added or modified to handle an empty `__all__` attribute.\n\n2. In `sphinx/util/inspect.py`:\n   - The `getall` function retrieves the `__all__` attribute from a module. This function is relevant because it directly deals with the `__all__` attribute and can be used to check if it is empty.\n\nThe relevant code spans are:\n- `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`: spans `Documenter`, `Documenter.__init__`, and `Documenter.filter_members`\n- `sphinx/util/inspect.py`: span `getall`\n\nThese spans are relevant because they either handle the `__all__` attribute or process module members, which is directly related to the reported issue.",
