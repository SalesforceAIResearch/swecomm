In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`:\n   - The `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is set to `migration.atomic`. This needs to be modified to also consider `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`.\n\n2. In `django/db/backends/base/features.py`:\n   - The `BaseDatabaseFeatures` class where `can_rollback_ddl` is defined.
