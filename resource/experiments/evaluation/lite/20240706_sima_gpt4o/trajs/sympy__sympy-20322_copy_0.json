If\n    your algorithm relies on \"simplification\" (whatever it is), try to\n    determine what you need exactly  -  is it powsimp()?, radsimp()?,\n    together()?, logcombine()?, or something else? And use this particular\n    function directly, because those are well defined and thus your algorithm\n    will be robust.\n\n    Nonetheless, especially for interactive use, or when you don't know\n    anything about the structure of the expression, simplify() tries to apply\n    intelligent heuristics to make the input expression \"simpler\".  For\n    example:\n\n    >>> from sympy import simplify, cos, sin\n    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y\n    >>> a = (x + x**2)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> a\n    (x**2 + x)/(x*sin(y)**2 + x*cos(y)**2)\n    >>> simplify(a)\n    x + 1\n\n    Note that we could have obtained the same result by using specific\n    simplification functions:\n\n    >>> from sympy import trigsimp, cancel\n    >>> trigsimp(a)\n    (x**2 + x)/x\n    >>> cancel(_)\n    x + 1\n\n    In some cases, applying :func:`simplify` may actually result in some more\n    complicated expression.
