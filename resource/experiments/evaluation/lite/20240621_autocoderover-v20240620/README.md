# AutoCodeRover-v20240620

This is the result of the second version of AutoCodeRover (v20240620) on SWE-bench-lite.
Source code of this version is not released at the moment.

AutoCodeRover is a project structure-aware autonomous software engineering agent
aimed at autonomous program improvement.
AutoCodeRover iteratively retrieves the relevant program context through
AST-level code retrieval APIs.
AutoCodeRover also integrates software debugging capabilities into the agent.
When test cases are available, AutoCodeRover can employ localization
techniques such as Spectrum-based Fault Localization to identify more
relevant program locations for the task.
