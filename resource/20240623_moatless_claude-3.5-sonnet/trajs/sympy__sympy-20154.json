There is a caveat about it in the docstring. \r\n\r\nI'm wondering if it's really that important for it to do this. It shouldn't be that much of a performance loss to copy the dictionary before yielding it. This behavior is very confusing. It means that something as simple as list(partitions()) will give an apparently wrong result. And it can lead to much more subtle bugs if the partitions are used in a nontrivial way. \n",

The partitions() function is defined in the span with id 'partitions'. This is the main code we need to focus on.\n\n3. The function uses a dictionary 'ms' to store the partition information. This dictionary is yielded multiple times throughout the function.\n\n4. The issue mentions a caveat in the docstring, but the search results don't include the function's docstring. We should note this as potentially missing information.\n\n5. The function yields 'ms' directly without copying it:\n   - In the size=True case: `yield sum(ms.values()), ms`\n   - In the size=False case: `yield ms`\n\n6. The 'ms' dictionary is modified in-place throughout the function, particularly in the while loop.\n\n7. There's no copying of the 'ms' dictionary before yielding, which aligns with the reported issue of reusing output dictionaries.\n\nBased on this analysis, the span containing the partitions() function is highly relevant to the reported issue.

The issue mentions that the partitions() iterator reuses output dictionaries. This behavior is evident in the code:\n   - The function uses a dictionary 'ms' to store the partition.\n   - This 'ms' dictionary is modified in place throughout the function.\n   - The function yields 'ms' directly without creating a copy.\n\n3.

However, the behavior described in the issue is clearly present in the code.\n\n4. The concern raised in the issue about list(partitions()) giving an apparently wrong result is justified based on this implementation. Since the same dictionary is being modified and yielded, capturing all yields in a list would indeed lead to unexpected results.\n\n5. The suggestion to copy the dictionary before yielding it is a valid potential solution to the problem described in the issue.\n\nGiven that we have found the exact function mentioned in the issue and can see the behavior that's causing the problem, I believe we have all the relevant code needed to address this issue.
