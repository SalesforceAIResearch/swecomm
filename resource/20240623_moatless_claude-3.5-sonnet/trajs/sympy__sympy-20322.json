The issue is related to the `sympify` function and its `evaluate` parameter.\n2. The `sympify` function is defined in the `sympy/core/sympify.py` file.\n3. The relevant code span for the `sympify` function starts at the span id 'sympify'.\n\nLet's examine the `sympify` function:\n\n1. The `evaluate` parameter is passed to the function:\n   ```python\n   def sympify(a, locals=None, convert_xor=True, strict=False, rational=False, evaluate=None):\n   ```\n\n2. If `evaluate` is None, it's set to the global parameter:\n   ```python\n   if evaluate is None:\n       evaluate = global_parameters.evaluate\n   ```\n\n3. The `evaluate` parameter is passed to the `parse_expr` function:\n   ```python\n   expr = parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)\n   ```\n\nThis code span is relevant because it shows how the `evaluate` parameter is handled in the `sympify` function. The inconsistent behavior reported in the issue likely stems from changes in how `parse_expr` or subsequent simplification steps handle the `evaluate` parameter.\n\nTo fully understand the issue, we would need to examine the `parse_expr` function and the simplification process, which are not present in the provided search results. However, this code span is crucial for understanding how `sympify` processes the `evaluate` parameter.\n\nGiven the information available, I'll identify this code span as relevant to the reported issue.",

The issue involves the `ceiling` function and its interaction with `sympify` and `simplify`.\n\n2. The `ceiling` class is defined in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`. This is likely the main implementation of the ceiling function.\n\n3. The `ceiling` method is also implemented in various number classes in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, including `Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`, `Infinity`, `NegativeInfinity`, `NaN`, and `ComplexInfinity`.\n\n4. The `sympify` function is defined in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which is not in the search results but is mentioned in the issue.\n\n5. The `simplify` function is not present in the search results, but it's mentioned in the issue.\n\n6. The inconsistency occurs between different versions of SymPy (v1.5.1 and v1.6.2), which suggests that changes in the implementation of these functions might be responsible.\n\n7. The most relevant code for this issue is likely the `ceiling` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`, as it's the main implementation of the ceiling function.\n\n8. The `ceiling` methods in the number classes in `sympy/core/numbers.py` are also relevant, as they handle special cases for different types of numbers.\n\n9. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py` is relevant, but it's not in the search results. We might need to look at it separately.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll identify the most relevant code spans:\n\n1. The entire `ceiling` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`\n2. The `ceiling` methods in the number classes in `sympy/core/numbers.py`\n\nThese code spans are most likely to be involved in the inconsistent behavior reported in the issue.",

The `simplify` method is not directly visible in the provided code, but it's likely part of the core SymPy functionality.\n\nThe inconsistent behavior reported in the issue is related to how `sympify` and `simplify` interact with the `ceiling` function. The relevant parts of the code that could be causing this behavior are:\n\n1. The `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which handles the parsing and evaluation of expressions.\n2. The `ceiling` class in `sympy/functions/elementary/integers.py`, which is a subclass of `RoundFunction`.\n3. The `Number` class and its subclasses (`Float`, `Rational`, `Integer`) in `sympy/core/numbers.py`, which implement the `ceiling` method.\n\nThese pieces of code are sufficient to understand and potentially address the reported issue. The inconsistency likely stems from how the `evaluate` parameter in `sympify` affects the simplification of the ceiling function.\n\nGiven that we have identified the relevant code and there are no obvious references to other parts of the codebase that would be necessary to understand or fix this issue, I believe we have all the necessary context to address the reported problem.",
