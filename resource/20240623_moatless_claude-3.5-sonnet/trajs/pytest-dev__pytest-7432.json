The issue is about `--runxfail` breaking the location reporting for `pytest.mark.skip`.\n2. The hint suggests the bug is in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, specifically in the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook.\n3. The search results show the content of `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, including the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function.\n\nLet's examine the `pytest_runtest_makereport` function:\n\n1. It's a hook implementation, which matches the hint.\n2. It handles various test outcomes, including skipped tests.\n3. There's a specific condition for handling skipped tests marked by `skipif`:\n   ```python\n   elif (\n       item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True)\n       and rep.skipped\n       and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple\n   ):\n   ```\n4. When this condition is met, it changes the location of the failure to point to the item definition.\n5. However, there's a condition earlier in the function that might interfere:\n   ```python\n   elif item.config.option.runxfail:\n       pass\n   ```\n   This condition checks for the `--runxfail` option and does nothing if it's set.\n\nThe bug is likely in this part of the code. When `--runxfail` is used, it's bypassing the normal skip handling, including the part that corrects the location reporting for skipped tests.\n\nBased on this analysis, I'll identify the relevant code spans.\n",

The file `src/_pytest/skipping.py` contains the `pytest_runtest_makereport` hook, which is exactly where the bug is said to be located.\n\nThe relevant part of the code that needs attention is:\n\n```python\n@hookimpl(hookwrapper=True)\ndef pytest_runtest_makereport(item: Item, call: CallInfo[None]):\n    outcome = yield\n    rep = outcome.get_result()\n    xfailed = item._store.get(xfailed_key, None)\n    if unexpectedsuccess_key in item._store and rep.when == \"call\":\n        # ...

(code for xfail)\n    elif not rep.skipped and xfailed:\n        # ... (code for xfail handling)\n    elif (\n        item._store.get(skipped_by_mark_key, True)\n        and rep.skipped\n        and type(rep.longrepr) is tuple\n    ):\n        # skipped by mark.skipif; change the location of the failure\n        # to point to the item definition, otherwise it will display\n        # the location of where the skip exception was raised within pytest\n        _, _, reason = rep.longrepr\n        filename, line = item.reportinfo()[:2]\n        assert line is not None\n        rep.longrepr = str(filename), line + 1, reason\n```\n\nThis code is responsible for handling different test outcomes, including skipped tests. The issue mentions that the `--runxfail` option is affecting the skip location reporting, which shouldn't happen. The relevant part is likely the `elif item.config.option.runxfail:` condition, which currently just passes without any specific handling.\n\nThe bug is probably related to how this condition interacts with the skip handling logic in the last `elif` block. When `--runxfail` is used, it might be bypassing the correct skip location reporting.\n\nGiven that we have found the exact function mentioned in the issue and the relevant code that handles both the `--runxfail` option and skip reporting, I believe we have all the necessary context to address this issue.

The change ensures that skipped tests are handled correctly when the `--runxfail` option is used, fixing the location reporting problem. The modification adds a specific check for skipped tests when `--runxfail` is active, and updates the `longrepr` attribute to point to the correct file and line number. This should now correctly report the skip location for tests marked with `@pytest.mark.skip` or `skipif`, even when running with `pytest -rs --runxfail`.",
