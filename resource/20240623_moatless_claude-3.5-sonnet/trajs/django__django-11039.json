The issue is about the sqlmigrate command wrapping its output in BEGIN/COMMIT even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL.\n\n2. The fix involves changing the assignment of self.output_transaction in sqlmigrate to consider connection.features.can_rollback_ddl.\n\n3. We need to look for the sqlmigrate command implementation and the related database features.\n\nAnalyzing the search results:\n\n1. In django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, we find the Command class for sqlmigrate. The relevant part is:\n\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n\n   This is where the output_transaction is currently being set, but it's not considering the database's ability to rollback DDL.\n\n2. In django/db/backends/base/features.py, we find the BaseDatabaseFeatures class, which includes:\n\n   can_rollback_ddl = False\n\n   This is the feature flag we need to consider when setting output_transaction.\n\n3. The MigrationExecutor in django/db/migrations/executor.py doesn't seem directly relevant to this issue, but it's worth noting that it uses the atomic attribute of migrations when applying them.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most relevant code spans are in django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py and django/db/backends/base/features.py.",

The issue states that the `sqlmigrate` command is wrapping its output in BEGIN/COMMIT even when the database doesn't support transactional DDL. \n\nLet's analyze the relevant parts of the code:\n\n1. In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`, we can see the `Command` class for the `sqlmigrate` command.\n\n2. The `handle` method of this class sets `self.output_transaction = migration.atomic`.\n\n3. However, this doesn't take into account whether the database supports transactional DDL or not.\n\n4. The `collect_sql` method in `MigrationExecutor` class (in `django/db/migrations/executor.py`) is responsible for collecting SQL statements for the migration.\n\n5. In the `collect_sql` method, we can see that it uses `migration.atomic` when creating the schema editor:\n   ```python\n   with self.connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True, atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:\n   ```\n\n6. This means that the `atomic` attribute of the migration is being used to determine whether to use transactions, without considering the database's capability to roll back DDL.\n\nTo fix this issue, we need to modify the `sqlmigrate` command to consider both `migration.atomic` and `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` when setting `self.output_transaction`.\n\nThe relevant code spans are:\n\n1. In `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`:\n   - The `handle` method where `self.output_transaction` is set.\n\n2. In `django/db/migrations/executor.py`:\n   - The `collect_sql` method where the schema editor is created with the `atomic` parameter.\n\nThese spans are crucial for implementing the fix as described in the issue.",

Let's break down the findings:\n\n1. In django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py, we found the Command class where the output_transaction is set:\n\n   self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n\nThis is the main part that needs to be modified to consider both the migration's atomic property and the database's ability to rollback DDL.\n\n2. In django/db/backends/base/features.py, we found the BaseDatabaseFeatures class with the can_rollback_ddl property:\n\n   can_rollback_ddl = False\n\nThis property needs to be checked along with the migration's atomic property.\n\n3. In django/db/migrations/executor.py, we found the MigrationExecutor class with the collect_sql method:\n\n   def collect_sql(self, plan):\n       statements = []\n       state = None\n       for migration, backwards in plan:\n           with self.connection.schema_editor(collect_sql=True, atomic=migration.atomic) as schema_editor:\n               # ... rest of the method\n\nThis method is responsible for collecting SQL statements, and it uses the migration.atomic property when creating the schema_editor.\n\nWith these three pieces of code, we have all the necessary components to implement the fix for the reported issue. The solution would involve:\n\n1. Modifying the Command class in sqlmigrate.py to consider both migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl when setting self.output_transaction.\n2. Ensuring that the BaseDatabaseFeatures.can_rollback_ddl property is correctly set for each database backend.\n3. Potentially modifying the MigrationExecutor.collect_sql method to respect the new output_transaction logic.\n\nGiven that we have identified all the relevant code areas, I believe the task is complete, and we have sufficient information to implement the fix as described in the issue report.",
