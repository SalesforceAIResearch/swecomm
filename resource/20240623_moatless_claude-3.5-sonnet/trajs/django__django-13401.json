I found this surprising, though in practice using a list was sufficient for my need. The root of the issue is that they compare equal, as fields only consider self.creation_counter when comparing for equality.\nlen({B._meta.get_field('myfield'), C._meta.get_field('myfield')}) == 1\nB._meta.get_field('myfield') == C._meta.get_field('myfield')\nWe should adjust __eq__ so that if the field.model is different, they will compare unequal. Similarly, it is probably wise to adjust __hash__ and __lt__ to match.\nWhen adjusting __lt__, it may be wise to order first by self.creation_counter so that cases not affected by this equality collision won't be re-ordered. In my experimental branch, there was one test that broke if I ordered them by model first.\nI brought this up on IRC django-dev to check my intuitions, and those conversing with me there seemed to agree that the current behavior is not intuitive.\n",

Let's break down the problem and the relevant code:\n\n1. The issue describes that fields from different models (B and C) inheriting from an abstract model (A) are considered equal, which is unexpected behavior.\n\n2. The root cause is identified in the __eq__ method of the Field class, which only compares the creation_counter.\n\n3. The proposed solution is to adjust __eq__, __hash__, and __lt__ methods to consider the field's model when comparing.\n\nLet's examine the relevant code spans:\n\na. Field.__eq__ method (span id 'Field.__eq__'):\nThis method only compares the creation_counter, which is the cause of the issue. It needs to be modified to include the field's model in the comparison.\n\nb. Field.__lt__ method (span id 'Field.__lt__'):\nThis method also only compares the creation_counter. It should be updated to consider the field's model, but maintain the creation_counter as the primary sorting criteria to avoid breaking existing behavior.\n\nc. Field.__hash__ method (span id 'Field.__hash__'):\nThis method only hashes the creation_counter. It should be updated to include the field's model in the hash calculation.\n\nThese code spans are highly relevant to the reported issue and need to be modified to implement the suggested changes. The Field class definition (span id 'Field') is also relevant as it contains these methods and the creation_counter attribute.\n\nThe imports section (span id 'imports') is not directly relevant to the issue but may be needed if we need to import additional modules for the implementation.\n\nBased on this analysis, I will identify the relevant code spans for addressing the issue.",
