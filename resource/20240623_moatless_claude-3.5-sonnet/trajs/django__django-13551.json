The key method we need to modify is _make_hash_value().\n\nLet's analyze the relevant code:\n\n1. In django/contrib/auth/tokens.py, we have the PasswordResetTokenGenerator class:\n   - The make_token() method generates a token for a user.\n   - The check_token() method verifies if a token is valid for a user.\n   - The _make_token_with_timestamp() method creates the actual token.\n   - The _make_hash_value() method generates the hash value used in token creation.\n\n2. The current implementation of _make_hash_value() is:\n   ```python\n   def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n       login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n       return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp)\n   ```\n\n3. As we can see, the user's email is not included in the hash value. This is why changing the email doesn't invalidate the token.\n\n4. To fix this issue, we need to modify the _make_hash_value() method to include the user's email in the hash calculation.\n\n5. The fix would involve adding the user's email to the returned string in _make_hash_value():\n   ```python\n   def _make_hash_value(self, user, timestamp):\n       login_timestamp = '' if user.last_login is None else user.last_login.replace(microsecond=0, tzinfo=None)\n       email = getattr(user, user.get_email_field_name(), '')  # Get the user's email\n       return str(user.pk) + user.password + str(login_timestamp) + str(timestamp) + email\n   ```\n\nThis modification will ensure that if a user's email changes, the generated token will be different, thus invalidating any existing password reset tokens.\n\nThe relevant code span for this change is in the PasswordResetTokenGenerator._make_hash_value method.",

We added the user's email to the hash value calculation, which will invalidate password reset tokens if the user's email is changed. This implementation handles cases where the email might be None or not present by using str(user.email). The change is minimal and focused on the specific problem described in the issue.",
