The idiff function is found in the sympy/geometry/util.py file, which matches our search results.\n\n3. Let's examine the idiff function:\n   - It takes parameters eq, y, x, and n (with a default value of 1).\n   - It checks if y is a sequence or a Symbol.\n   - It creates a dictionary f for x-dependent symbols.\n   - It uses solve to find the derivative.\n\n4. The reported issues are:\n   a) idiff doesn't support Eq\n   b) It doesn't support f(x) instead of y\n\n5. Analyzing the code for these issues:\n   a) There's no explicit handling of Eq objects in the function, which explains why it doesn't support Eq.\n   b) The function expects y to be either a sequence or a Symbol. It raises a ValueError if y is neither, which explains why it doesn't support f(x).\n\n6. The relevant code spans for these issues are:\n   - The entire idiff function (span id 'idiff')\n   - Specifically, the part that checks the type of y and raises the ValueError\n\nBased on this analysis, I can identify the relevant code span for addressing the reported issues.\n",
