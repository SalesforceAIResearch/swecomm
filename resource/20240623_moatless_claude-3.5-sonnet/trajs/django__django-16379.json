The problematic code is exactly as described in the issue:\n   - It checks if the file exists using os.path.exists(fname)\n   - Then it tries to open the file with open(fname, \"rb\")\n   - Between these two operations, there's a potential for a race condition\n\nThe race condition occurs because another thread or process could delete the file after the existence check but before the file is opened.

The problem occurs between the os.path.exists(fname) check and the subsequent file opening operation.\n\nWhile we don't see the implementation of the _is_expired method in this context, the issue description mentions that this method can delete the file if it's expired, which explains the potential for a race condition.\n\nGiven that we have found the exact code mentioned in the issue, and it's located in the correct file (django/core/cache/backends/filebased.py), we can conclude that we have all the relevant code needed to understand and potentially address this issue.\n\nTherefore, I'm marking this task as complete and relevant.
