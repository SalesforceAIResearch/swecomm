Looking at cleanse_setting() I realized that we \u200bonly take care of `dict`s but don't take other types of iterables into account but \u200breturn them as-is.\nExample:\nIn my settings.py I have this:\nMY_SETTING = {\n\t\"foo\": \"value\",\n\t\"secret\": \"value\",\n\t\"token\": \"value\",\n\t\"something\": [\n\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t],\n\t\"else\": [\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t\t[\n\t\t\t{\"foo\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"secret\": \"value\"},\n\t\t\t{\"token\": \"value\"},\n\t\t],\n\t]\n}\nOn Django 3.0 and below:\n>>> import pprint\n>>> from django.views.debug import get_safe_settings\n>>> pprint.pprint(get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\nOn Django 3.1 and up:\n>>> from django.views.debug import SafeExceptionReporterFilter\n>>> import pprint\n>>> pprint.pprint(SafeExceptionReporterFilter().get_safe_settings()[\"MY_SETTING\"])\n{'else': [[{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n\t\t [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}]],\n 'foo': 'value',\n 'secret': '********************',\n 'something': [{'foo': 'value'}, {'secret': 'value'}, {'token': 'value'}],\n 'token': '********************'}\n",

The issue is related to the `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class in `django/views/debug.py`.\n\n2. The main problem is in the `cleanse_setting` method, which doesn't handle nested iterables (like lists) properly.\n\n3. Current implementation:\n   - It checks if the value is a dict and recursively cleanses it.\n   - For non-dict values, it returns them as-is.\n\n4. This leads to the problem described in the issue, where nested lists containing sensitive information are not cleansed.\n\n5. The `get_safe_settings` method uses `cleanse_setting` to process all settings, so the issue propagates to the final output.\n\n6. To fix this, we need to modify the `cleanse_setting` method to handle all types of iterables, not just dicts.\n\n7. The relevant code spans are:\n   - The entire `SafeExceptionReporterFilter` class definition\n   - The `cleanse_setting` method\n   - The `get_safe_settings` method\n\nThese spans contain the core functionality that needs to be modified to address the issue.\n",

The file django/views/debug.py contains the SafeExceptionReporterFilter class with the cleanse_setting() method, which is the focus of the reported problem.\n\nThe issue describes that the cleanse_setting() method only handles dictionaries and doesn't account for other iterable types. This is evident in the provided code:\n\n```python\ndef cleanse_setting(self, key, value):\n    try:\n        if self.hidden_settings.search(key):\n            cleansed = self.cleansed_substitute\n        elif isinstance(value, dict):\n            cleansed = {k: self.cleanse_setting(k, v) for k, v in value.items()}\n        else:\n            cleansed = value\n    except TypeError:\n        # If the key isn't regex-able, just return as-is.\n        cleansed = value\n\n    if callable(cleansed):\n        cleansed = CallableSettingWrapper(cleansed)\n\n    return cleansed\n```\n\nAs we can see, the method only checks if the value is a dictionary (isinstance(value, dict)) and recursively cleanses it. For all other types, including other iterables like lists, it simply returns the value as-is, which is the root cause of the issue described.\n\nThe get_safe_settings() method is also present in the provided code, which uses the cleanse_setting() method to process all settings:\n\n```python\ndef get_safe_settings(self):\n    settings_dict = {}\n    for k in dir(settings):\n        if k.isupper():\n            settings_dict[k] = self.cleanse_setting(k, getattr(settings, k))\n    return settings_dict\n```\n\nThis confirms that we have all the relevant code needed to understand and potentially fix the reported issue.
