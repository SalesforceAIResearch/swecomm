                    "msg": "1. **Understand the Issue:**\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue described pertains to the wrong URL being generated for a read-only ForeignKey field listed in a custom Admin Site in Django. Specifically, the URL is erroneously formed as '/admin/...' instead of the expected '/custom-admin/...'. This happens in the `get_admin_url` function within 'django.contrib.admin.helpers', which isn't correctly factoring in the current admin site's name when reversing URLs. This bug can cause misrouting issues when trying to navigate to these read-only field URLs in a custom admin setup.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n\nList of span ids:\n- AdminReadonlyField\n- AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url\n- ModelAdmin\n- AdminSite\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `AdminReadonlyField`: This class encompasses fields that are displayed as read-only in the admin interface. It is relevant to the issue because the bug is in generating URL for read-only fields in a custom admin site.\n\n2. `AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url`: This function is called to generate the URL for a remote (foreign key) object, and it is directly the function mentioned as having the incorrect URL generation logic. Fixing this function should ensure the URL includes the custom admin site prefix if necessary.\n\n3. `ModelAdmin`: This class contains the functionalities and properties associated with Django\u2019s model admin options. Its relevance lies in the way it defines behaviors and configurations within the admin interface, potentially juxtaposing how URLs are managed concerning this context.\n\n4. `AdminSite`: This explains the `AdminSite` class that encapsulates Django\u2019s admin application instance, and its configuration and attributes define how custom admin sites might normalize and generate URLs among other things. Setting or accessing the `admin_site.name` attribute is crucial in addressing the issue at hand.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n \nList of modified hunks:\n- django/contrib/admin/helpers.py: 206-217\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The initial code in `get_admin_url` directly creates a URL using the `reverse` method, concerning only the app label and model name from `remote_field.model._meta`. This doesn\u2019t consider the specialized admin site.\n\n2. The proposed patch adds the `current_app` parameter to the `reverse` function call and sets it to `self.model_admin.admin_site.name`. This change ensures that the correct admin site's URL prefixed path is created while resolving the URL for the foreign key field object.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The `get_admin_url` method inside `AdminReadonlyField` class is explicitly mentioned in the issue and is indeed responsible for generating the URL. Adding the `current_app` with `self.model_admin.admin_site.name` ensures the URL will properly reflect the custom admin path, addressing the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The added `current_app` argument in the `reverse` call aligns with how other parts of Django handle URL resolution for custom admin sites. Existing code spans particularly `ModelAdmin` and the conceptual term of `AdminSite`, which maintain the ERP structures.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the issue as described - the corrected URL generation using the current `admin_site` name should ensure the URLs point to the correct admin site path (`/custom-admin/...`). This matches the common understanding required to solve objective error as stated. Validation across a suite of tests and diverse admin arrangements would further endorse reliability.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:**\n\n<score>9</score>"

Specifically, the generated link for these fields points to the wrong URL (`/admin/...` instead of `/custom-admin/...`). This URL mismatch is noted to stem from a function in the `django.contrib.admin.helpers` file, and the proposed fix seeks to pass the correct namespace of the Admin Site using `current_app`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue describes a situation where URLs for readonly ForeignKey fields in a custom Admin Site are generated incorrectly as `/admin/...` instead of the custom admin path.

Specifically, the problem was documented to be in the `get_admin_url` function, located inside the `AdminReadonlyField` class. Hence, introducing a parameter to adapt the current admin site appropriately here is logical and pertinent.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues directly. It follows the format used in other parts where `current_app` is employed to assure URL consistency for custom admin paths.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aligns with the suggested solution mentioned in the issue specification. It rectifies the URL generation's faulty part by introducing the `current_app` parameter. Based on the `current_app` addition in the reverse function based on Django's standard practice for custom admin apps, it stands as a plausible and only minor observation would be ensuring claims for Django versions supporting that alteration are verified compatibility-wise within an expected test suite umbrella.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Final Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

The issue was specifically with the `get_admin_url` method in `AdminReadonlyField`, and the patch correctly inserts the `current_app` parameter here to resolve the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces the `current_app` parameter to the `reverse()` function to ensure that the correct URL pattern is generated. There don't seem to be any contradictions., and it doesn't appear to introduce new issues upon initial analysis. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is well-aligned with the issue's details and highlights about incorporating the `current_app` parameter to the reverse function liquid sporting the correct execution site of the admin panel URL. There are no indications of typical mistakes.\n\nThe fix logically aligns with the nature of the error described in the issue and using `self.model_admin.admin_site.name` standard resolution completely is recommended to align set definition records elsewhere to `self`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
