Both are correctly utilized to broaden the functional support of the respective types.

Transforming `Eq` objects: The patch successfully converts `Eq` instances into regular expressions which is critical for the differentiation steps later in the function.\n2. Handling functions: By recognizing when `y` is given as a function and adjusting accordingly, the patch implements a way to simplify the expression format that can be handled by subsequent steps.\n\nNo incorrect common LLM mistakes, such as removing necessary functionality, introducing major vulnerabilities, or making syntactical errors, are evident in these changes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
