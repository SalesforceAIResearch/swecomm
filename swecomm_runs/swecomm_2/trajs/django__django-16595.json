It sets up the state that eventually gets optimized.\n   \n   4. **AlterField:** The class representing the `AlterField` operation, relevant because that's the type of operation that needs better reducing.\n   \n   5. **AlterField.reduce:** This method attempts to reduce an `AlterField` operation with another `Operation`. It's relevant to understand how current reduction logic is failing to handle multiple `AlterField` consolidations.\n   \n   6. **MigrationOptimizer:** The main optimizer class that handles optimizing lists of migration operations, including possibly detecting the need for reduction.\n   \n   7. **MigrationOptimizer.optimize:** The main entry point for the optimization process, which, in combination with other methods, should be responsible for reducing multiple `AlterField` operations.\n   \n   8. **MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner:** The inner loop invoked by the optimizer, which deals with the detailed, step-by-step reduction of operations.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n   List of modified hunks:\n   1. lines 259-269 in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`\n   \n   Explanation of each modified hunk:\n  \n   <patch_exp>\n   1. **Hunk (259-269):** \n      - **Before**: The function returns a list containing the operation and a new `AlterField` instance whenever it encounters a `RenameField` operation and the `db_column` is `None`.\n      - **After**: Adds an additional case handling for reducing two `AlterField` operations. If the current operation is an `AlterField` and represents the same field, it reduces to just the `AlterField` operation given.\n      - This is meant to ensure redundant `AlterField` operations on the same field get consolidated.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   The patch does modify the `reduce` function within the `AlterField` class, which is the correct function to handle the reduction of migration operations. Therefore, it's indeed targeting the appropriate location for the intended fix.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues or contradictions:**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch doesn't seem to introduce any new issues or contradict the identified code spans directly. Its new condition specifically handles an additional case for the reduction of `AlterField` operations without altering existing logic for other operations substantially.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch introduces logic to handle operations of the same type (`AlterField`), ensuring they can be reduced to just one operation if they are on the same field. This seems to address the core of the described issue \u2014 reducing unnecessary `AlterField` sequences. Hence, it should effectively resolve the problem described in the issue, ensuring multiple redundant operations are optimized out.\n  \n   While it is plausible that the `super().reduce(operation, app_label)` could incorporate constraints that verify if an entirely common operation sequence is generated, that would add needless complexity to this specific use case beyond given descriptions.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score the patch:**\n\n<score>9</score>"

It is indirectly relevant because alterations in migrations heavily involve altering fields.\n   \n2. MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_fields: This method generates `AlterField` operations that make changes to fields' attributes, such as `null`, `max_length`, etc. This span generates the operations that may need to be reduced or optimized. \n\n3.

AlterField.reduce: This span outlines the current strategy for reducing `AlterField` with other operations, showing behavior that needs modification to handle reduction against other `AlterField` operations.\n\n6. MigrationOptimizer: A class to handle the optimization of migration operations sequences, including merging and reducing operations wherever possible.

Modified Class: `AlterField`\n\n- Added Check:\n  ```python\n  if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation):\n      return [operation]\n  ```\n- This hun removedes successive `AlterField` operations modifying the same field redundantly. It occurs before checks for `RemoveField/` and `RenameField` operations, covering uniformly any alterable fields appropriate during optimization.\n\n2. Modified Test File: `test_operations.py`\n\n- Added Test Method:\n  ```python\n  def test_alter_field_reduce(self):\n      # series of nested AlterField tests showcasing reduction in action\n  ```\n- Introduces relevant fields examples and actual assertive checks confirming that reducing cascaded `AlterField` queries centralizes them better.\n  * Validates typical cases with varied attributes wary to matching limitations like exclusivities present (`operation.many_to_many`, `questioner.ask`, default behaviors/tests.).\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the changes are correctly situated.

As a result, multiple redundant `AlterField` operations remain instead of a single optimized operation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n\n**List of Span IDs:**\n- `MigrationAutodetector`\n- `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_fields`\n- `MigrationAutodetector._detect_changes`\n- `AlterField`\n- `AlterField.reduce`\n- `MigrationOptimizer`\n- `MigrationOptimizer.optimize`\n- `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `MigrationAutodetector`: Contains the logic for detecting changes between project states, relevant for understanding the broader context of migration detection and how operations are processed during migrations.\n\n2. `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_fields`: Specifically generates `AlterField` operations, which underpin why multiple `AlterField` operations might result without reduction.\n\n3. `MigrationAutodetector._detect_changes`: Method that identifies and lists changes needed, starting the flow that will eventually involve optimization.\n\n4. `AlterField`: The `AlterField` operation class represents modification to a field\u2019s definition, the core type of operation being discussed in the issue.\n\n5. `AlterField.reduce`: Central to the problem; it defines how `AlterField` operations are reduced, which presently does not handle multiple `AlterField` operations as intended.\n\n6. `MigrationOptimizer`: Manages the overall optimization process, and plays a crucial role in whether redundant `AlterField` operations get reduced.\n\n7. `MigrationOptimizer.optimize`: Ensures that the sequence of migrations returns a possibly reduced list, identifying redundancies; could pinpoint where reduction fails.\n\n8. `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner`: Helper function for `MigrationOptimizer.optimize` performing the grunt work of trying optimizations between pairs of operations.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` (242\u2013common line range)\n2. `tests/migrations/test_operations.py` (line range varies, starting from 23)\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`:\n   - The patch modifies the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` class.\n   - Adds a condition `if isinstance(operation, AlterField) and self.is_same_field_operation(operation)` to check if the current operation can be reduced with another `AlterField` operation.\n\n2. `tests/migrations/test_operations.py`:\n   - Adds a new test method `test_alter_field_reduce`.\n   - This method rigorously tests the `reduce` method of the `AlterField` operation with various scenarios, checking if multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field properly reduce to a single operation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the `reduce` method in the `AlterField` class, which is the correct location for fixing the issue of reducing multiple `AlterField` operations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking if the Patch is Introducing New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It adds a new conditional to the reduction check that ensures `AlterField` operations for the same field are reduced as expected. There is no conflict with any of the identified code spans. The new test verifies that the code operates correctly in multiple scenarios.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adds the necessary condition to the `reduce` method of `AlterField` to handle multiple `AlterField` operations for the same field, as described in the issue. The new test cases effectively verify that the reduction works correctly. The changes are conceptually sound and should fix the issue without introducing new problems.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score Assessment**\n\n<score>9</score>"

The existing code returns a list of operations including `operation` and `AlterField` when encountering a `RenameField`, followed by returning the result of the base class's `reduce` method.\n2. The patch introduces an additional conditional block to handle the case where `operation` is also an `AlterField` and applies `is_same_field_operation()` to reduce it directly to `[operation]`.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The patch ensures that in addition to handling `RemoveField` and `RenameField`, the `reduce` function now explicitly checks if the given `operation` is an instance of `AlterField`. If it is, and it matches the current operation being processed (`self.is_same_field_operation(operation)`), it returns the single `operation` without additional ers, effectively reducing multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is located in the correct part of the code. The `AlterField.reduce` method is supposed to handle the optimization reduction logic for `AlterField` operations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues or contradict the identified code spans. It adds a necessary check specific to `AlterField` consistent with the other conditional checks already present.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly implements the proposed solution by introducing additional logic in the `AlterField.reduce` method to handle multiple `AlterField` operations on the same field properly. It effectively recognizes and optimizes away the redundant `AlterField` operations.\n\nWhile this addresses the provided issue, potential pitfalls like other related fields or edge cases where different fields might need separate handling have not been thoroughly tested. Overall, considering only the initial requirement, the patch appears to sufficiently address and fix the reported issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner\n\n1. `MigrationAutodetector`: This class might be responsible for identifying changes in project states that make it necessary to generate migration operations.\n\n2. `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_fields`: This function likely handles generating AlterField operations, potentially relevant for understanding where and how these operations originate.\n\n3. `MigrationAutodetector._detect_changes`: This function seems to be involved in the change detection mechanism that ultimately results in the generation of the migration operations.\n\n4. `AlterField`: This class represents the specific operation to alter a field in the database, fundamental for the issue since it entails creating migration operations for altering fields.\n\n5. `AlterField.reduce`: This method in the `AlterField` class performs the optimization by trying to reduce successive operations. It's directly focused on refining operations, but it currently lacks the logic to reduce multiple AlterField operations.\n\n6. `MigrationOptimizer`: This class includes general mechanisms to handle and optimize various migration operations, potentially including the identified need to process AlterField operations correctly.\n\n7. `MigrationOptimizer.optimize`: This function performs the overall migration optimization process, relevant to see how it processes AlterField operations among others.\n\n8. `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner`: This function works within the optimization loop, important for understanding the inner mechanisms handling reduction directly, especially surrounding AlterField operations.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py` around the reduce function implementation.\n\n1. The hunk in `fields.py` revises the `reduce` method to include a new clause under the metrics inspected while comparing field operations. Specifically, it introduces a check to handle cases where the operation is also an `AlterField` and the fields being modified are the same; if all conditions are met, the operation is returned as a single (reduced) entity.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch affects the `reduce` function of the `AlterField` class in `django/db/migrations/operations/fields.py`. This is the correct location for addressing the merging issue with multiple `AlterField` operations because this function is responsible for optimizing such migration operations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues have been detected from the patch. The modification aligns correctly with the logic for reducing field operations and preserves existing handling of other operations like `RemoveField` and `RenameField`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears designed to properly address the issue by introducing a condition to handle and simplify consecutive `AlterField` operations affecting the same model and field. This is precisely aligned with the noted gap as per the reduction objectives initially lacking in `reduce`. Since existing clauses are untouched, backward compatibility, as well as adherence to initial priorities of field optimization considerations remain intact. In absence of contrary evidence or overlooked subtleties presently identifiable, the patch correctly resolves the targeted setting engaging logic strong for reducing repetitive `AlterField` instances specifically.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
