AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled\n2. AssertionRewriter\n3. AssertionRewriter.run\n\n#### Span Descriptions:\n**AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled:**\n- This function checks if docstring rewriting is disabled by analyzing if \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" is in the given docstring.\n  \n**AssertionRewriter:**\n- This is the main class that handles assertion rewriting. It includes logic to visit AST nodes, rewrite assert statements, collect modules statements, and so on.\n  \n**AssertionRewriter.run:**\n- This function within the `AssertionRewriter` gets the module docstring and uses `is_rewrite_disabled` to potentially skip rewriting if a specific string is found. It appears to encounter issues when the docstring is a numeric value.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` - This method is pertinent because it processes the initial strings, thereby playing a role in the erroneous identification of numerical expressions as docstrings.\n2. `AssertionRewriter` - This class performs assertion rewriting tasks pivotal to the functionality of pytest, including operations on potential docstrings.\n3. `AssertionRewriter.run` - Most related to the issue, this function processes modules and validates their docstrings, whereby misidentification happens.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nHere are the modified hunks provided in the patch:\n1. Changes within the `is_rewrite_disabled` function checking for the string instance.\n\n#### Hunk Explained:\n**Before Patch:**\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef is_rewrite_disabled(docstring: str) -> bool:\n    return \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in docstring\n```\n**After Patch:**\n```python\n@staticmethod\ndef is_rewrite_disabled(docstring: str) -> bool:\n    if not isinstance(docstring, str):\n        return False\n    return \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in docstring\n```\nThis change explicitly checks if the given docstring is a string. If it isn't, the method will return `False`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch includes an added type check within the `is_rewrite_disabled` function to ensure the input `docstring` is a string, preventing the iteration TypeError by returning False for non-string values.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Verification\nThe function `is_rewrite_disabled` is closely tied to the instantiation and handling of the docstring so verifying type here fits logically with the broader mechanics in `run()`\u2014except the proposed safety within its isolation space is insured.\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch fixes the correct function `is_rewrite_disabled` because that's where docstring handling assurted its likeness.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check For New Issues\nGiven the change appreciates the docstring be a string or returns `False` -- affects file `is_rewrite_disabled`; worked without contradicting other code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>There doesn't seem to be a contradiction between the identified code spans and the patch. The patch ensures further stability by guarding against TypeError within `is_rewrite_disabled`.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if Patch Fix The Issue\nThis patch seems to fix the initial issue code from incorrectly interpreting numbers as docstrings by ensuring only strings are checked with logic applied to them. Hard-proofing would entail a deep series under context align.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch successfully addresses the issue by preventing integers from falsely initiating rewrites. It is competently crafted for misidentification constraints hollistic adherence.

If it's not a string, it prevents further processing related to a docstring.</patch_exp>\n\n2. **is_rewrite_disabled updates**:\n   <patch_exp>The patch updates the `is_rewrite_disabled` method to check if the docstring is genuinely a string before checking the \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" marker, to avoid TypeErrors confidently.</patch_exp>\n\n## Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch correctly addresses the `run` method in the `AssertionRewriter` class, the place where docstrings are processed and initially presumed.</correct_location_exp>\n\n## Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\nThe checks added in `is_rewrite_disabled` and inside the `run` method appear safe and do not introduce reasonable risks of breaking existing functionality.\n\n<new_issues_exp>No new issues or contradictions with identified code spans have been introduced above.</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\nComparing the patch against common mistakes:\n- **Misidentifying types**: The patch adequately verifies that a suspected docstring is a string, mitigating this problem.\n- **Logic errors**: Ensuring a non-string first expression is correctly processed.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch provides robust handling changes to ensure the first expression in Python files is identified as a docstring only if it is a string, effectively rectifying the underlying issue reported.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n## Final Score\n\nGiven the above assessment, there appear to be no deviations or missing understanding of patched cases. Hence, assigning a high rating within our rubric.\n\n<score>10</score>"

Change in `run` method from lines 661-687:\n   - The code under the modified block ensures the first expression is treated as a docstring only if it is actually a string, and otherwise considers the potential misinterpretation issue preventing it.\n   \n2. Change in `is_rewrite_disabled` method from lines 744-747:\n   - Updated the `is_rewrite_disabled` method to verify that the docstring is actually a string before attempting to check for \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" within it.\n</modified_hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

Understand the Issue\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue concerns `pytest` where a test module may fail to rewrite assert statements if the first expression in the file is a number, mistaking it for a docstring when it's not a string. This results in a `TypeError: argument of type 'int' is not iterable`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n\n### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\nSpan IDs: `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled`, `AssertionRewriter`, `AssertionRewriter.run`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Span ID: `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled`:\n   - This function checks if the given docstring contains the \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" marker. It is directly relevant because incorrect interpretation of the first expression as a docstring causes this function to raise an error.\n\n2.

Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `run` method, which is responsible for handling how the module's body content is interpreted and the `is_rewrite_disabled` method to manage iteration over an incorrect type safely.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n\n### 5. Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch modifies `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled` to check if `docstring` is an instance of `str` before checking if \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" is present. This should avoid the `TypeError`. This doesn't contradict the identified code because enhancing type safety in this way should mitigate the described issue without introducing further errors.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch directly addresses the underlying bug by ensuring that the first line is only considered a docstring if it is indeed a string. Moreover, it fortifies `is_rewrite_disabled` to prevent type-related errors. Carefully comparing with common mistakes made by LLMs, none such as logic discomfort or incomplete pattern-based fixes seem to apply here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n### 7. Evaluate and Score\n<score>10</score>\n\nThe patch correctly fixes the error as described without introducing new issues or contradicting any identified code spans.

The `is_rewrite_disabled` function has been updated to perform a type check on `PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE`, validating appropriate handling during string occurrence verification.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The function `AssertionRewriter.run` is indeed where the handling of docstrings and assertion transformations occurs. The bug trace in the issue report also points to this specific function chain, confirming the location is appropriate.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The refinements are consistent with the identified code spans. Specifically, the patch ensures changes are accommodated respecting the `is_rewrite_disabled` function and handled the docstring type validation in the run sequence carefully to avoid type mismatch issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue correctly by adding checks to ensure that only string literals are treated as docstrings. Furthermore, the refactored `is_rewrite_disabled` method safely handles cases where `docstring` may not be a string, which prevents the previous \"TypeError\". There are no common mistakes present such as missing validations or incorrect logic that are typically seen in LLM-generated patches.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
