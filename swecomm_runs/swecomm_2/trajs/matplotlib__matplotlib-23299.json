Gcf.destroy_fig: Contains code for `destroy_fig`, which depends on Gcf.figs to identify the figure to destroy.\n3. Gcf.destroy_all: Responsible for destroying all figures in the Gcf.figs.\n4. Gcf.destroy: Implements the logic to destroy a specific figure manager from the Gcf.figs.\n5. Gcf.get_fig_manager: Makes a figure manager active if it exists in Gcf.figs.\n6. Gcf.get_active: Returns the active figure manager, relying on Gcf.figs state.\n7.

By saving and then restoring the backend parameter, it ensures that the application context doesn't inadvertently clear out actively managed figures.\nHowever, while this fixes the immediate `rc_context` rule restoration problem, thorough testing across various other backend-changing contexts might be needed to confirm robustness.

This is relevant to how figures might be destroyed or set, which indirectly may cause or help resolve the current issue.\n- span_id=Gcf.destroy_all: Similar to destroy_fig, relates to handling figures.\n- span_id=Gcf.destroy: Dictates exact conditions under which a figure manager is removed from `Gcf.figs`.\n- span_id=Gcf.get_fig_manager: Handles fetching the figure manager by its number, which is crucial to manage life cycles.\n- span_id=Gcf.get_active: Returns the active manager, thus relevant to ensure the correct figures are actively tracked.\n- span_id=Gcf: This code span includes the setup and management of the `Gcf` singleton overall. \n- span_id=Gcf.set_active: Manages which figure manager is the active one.\n- span_id=Gcf._set_new_active_manager: This will impact integrating new figure managers into the environment, which might get unexpectedly cleared.\n- span_id=close: Directly impacts how figures are explicitly closed.\n- span_id=figure: Critical for creating or managing figures in general.\n- span_id=gcf: Returns the current figure that is active.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1 (line updated): This hunk introduces a step to preserve the current backend setting by temporarily storing it in a variable `current_backend` before restoring it after `rcParams` is reverted.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the function handling rc settings, which includes backend manipulations.

However, verifying `current_backend` exists and ensuring thread safety could be something of potential concern in more complex scenarios under heavy UI load or multifigure environments.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch potentially fixes the issue by saving the current backend before context switching and restoring it afterward, thus preventing unexpected clearing of figures related to backend shifting. This approach addresses preserving backend in `rc_context` evaluations, but careful unit tests across related workflows might still be necessary to confirm full robustness in practice against unintended side effects. It is not a common intermediate mistake (like clearing out too many context temp files), seems pointed and directed to what was explicitly stated within the bug over-report.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It's directly related to the issue since calling this function is causing figures to be removed.\n- `Gcf.destroy_fig`: This class method destroys a specific figure and removes it from `Gcf.figs`.\n- `Gcf.destroy_all`: This class method destroys all figures and clears `Gcf.figs`.\n- `Gcf.destroy`: This class method destroys a manager associated with a figure number and removes it from `Gcf.figs`.\n- `Gcf.get_fig_manager`: This function retrieves or creates a figure manager given a figure number. It's relevant as managing figures correctly prevents them from being inadvertently removed.\n- `Gcf.get_active`: This function retrieves the current active figure manager.\n- `Gcf`: This class maintains the relationship between figures and their managers using an OrderedDict named `figs`.\n- `Gcf.set_active`: This method sets a figure manager as the active one.\n- `Gcf._set_new_active_manager`: This internal method makes a new manager the current active figure manager and correctly registers its events.\n- `close`: Defines various ways to close figures and manage their lifecycle using methods in `Gcf`.\n- `figure`: Manages creation and clearance of figures and interacts with figure managers in `Gcf`.\n- `gcf`: Retrieves the current figure. If there is none, it creates and returns a new one using `figure()`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n\nModified Hunk:\n```diff\n 1090:     orig = rcParams.copy()\n 1091:     try:\n 1092:         if fname:\n 1093:             rc_file(fname)\n 1094:         if rc:\n 1095:             rcParams.update(rc)\n 1096:         yield\n 1097:     finally:\n+ 1098:         # Preserve the backend setting\n+ 1099:         current_backend = rcParams['backend']\n 1100:         dict.update(rcParams, orig)  # Revert to the original rcs.\n+ 1101:         rcParams['backend'] = current_backend  # Restore the current backend\n```\n\n<patch_exp>\nAdding the lines to save the current backend before updating rcParams and restore it afterward ensures that the backend setting remains consistent before and after using an `rc_context`. This modification prevents figures from being removed due to backend changes caused by the rc_context settings.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the context manager in `rc_context`, ensuring that the backend setting remains the same. This is relevant to the issue described as the problem occurs when figuring out the backend after figures have been created.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere seems to be no new issues being introduced given the modified code lines. The lines strategically preserve and restore the backend configuration. It also doesn't contradict with any of the described code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses a common cause of figure removal caused by backend switches when using `rc_context`. It preserves the backend before an rc_context change and restores it afterward, synchronizing rcParams' state. It does not fall into the common mistake categories made by LLMs. Thus, it seems to properly mitigate the root cause described in the issue and prevents figures from disappearing unexpectedly.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nSince the patch appears to both fix the actual problem described and avoids introducing new issues:\n\n<score>9</score>"

It merely notes the need for investigation of the interaction between `switch_backend`, `rc_context`, and the clearing of figures from `Gcf.figs`.
