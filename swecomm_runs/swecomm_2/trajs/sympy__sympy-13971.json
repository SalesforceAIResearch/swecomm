Understanding the Issue\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue describes a problem with how the function `SeqFormula` from the SymPy library produces output that includes backslash-escaped square brackets when displayed in a Jupyter notebook. The escaped characters `\\[...\\]` do not display correctly when copied into a markdown cell, whereas using normal square brackets `[...]` displays as expected. The proposal is to change the function so that either backslash-escaped square brackets are not used or they are interpreted properly.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understanding the Identified Code Spans\nFirst, list of span IDs:\n- LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code span is the `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula` method. This method in the given file is responsible for converting a sequence into its LaTeX representation. The function constructs a string representation using backslash-escaped square brackets (\\left\\[...\\right\\]), which is directly related to the issue reported. Changing this behavior could solve the problem.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understanding the Candidate Patch\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Replacement of `r\"\\left\\[\" , ... , r\"\\right\\]\"` with `'[' , ... , ']'` in the return statement inside `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `return` statement in the `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula` method. It changes the LaTeX-escaped square brackets (`r\"\\left\\[\" , ... , r\"\\right\\]\"`) to regular square brackets (`'[' , ... , ']'`). This aims to generate easily usable outputs in markdown that render correctly without manual intervention.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Checking Correct Function Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the correct function, `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula`, which is responsible for constructing the LaTeX string with the sequences and brackets. This function is directly involved in creating the output format that includes the LaTeX-escaped square brackets.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Checking for New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any new issues per the identified code span. Changing the `return` statement from LaTeX-escaped square brackets to regular square brackets is unlikely to cause additional problems since the function's basic goal is returning a printable sequence string, assuming it\u2014in LaTeX form\u2014originally couldn't handle regular brackets properly during other operations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Verification of the Patch\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the provided patch is definitely rectifying part of the issue by using unescaped square brackets and making it render as intended in markdown cells directly, it needs an examination of possible repercussions. This string is meant to interface with LaTeX running environments, ensuring this patch might require compliance checks to maneuvers bypassing `left/r[ \\]` for treating documents not desiring hard brackets.\n\nThe code switch currently prioritizes minimizing markdown escape troubles\u2014more investigative string management processes.

The modified output is simple text, which aligns with how Markdown cells expect the content to be for rendering correctly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The issue is caused by the improperly escaped square brackets in the output generated by `_print_SeqFormula`, and the patch addresses the string that this function returns.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. The key task is to change the output from LaTeX-rendered brackets to plain text brackets. There seem to be no side effects affecting other parts of the function since it solely changes the strings used for the brackets.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch directly addresses the issue by removing the LaTeX escape sequences for the brackets and using simple square brackets instead. This straightforward fix should solve the problem described by the initial issue. The change is logical and does not appear to fall into common LLM mistakes such as missing important details or misunderstanding the problem requirement.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
