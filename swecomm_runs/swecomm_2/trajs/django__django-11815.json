EnumSerializer: This shows the serializer class specifically designed for handling Enum objects. This class needs modification to correctly handle serialization.\n\n2. serializer_factory: This function is called to obtain the appropriate serializer instance based on the value type. Understanding this context helps in understanding EnumSerializer.\n\n3. EnumSerializer.serialize: This is the specific method within EnumSerializer responsible for serialization, and this seems to be the direct source of the issue about how Enum objects are currently being serialized.\n\n4. IntegerChoices: Shows a class that extends Enum, which might be relevant to ensure other Enum-like classes are not affected.\n\n5. TextChoices: Another subclass like IntegerChoices, indicating the flexibility of enum-like choices.\n\n6. Choices: The base class for IntegerChoices and TextChoices that extends Enum. \n\n7. CharField: Provides context about where Enum default values are being used potentially impacting how migrations for these fields need to be serialized.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. hunk at 119-125 in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`: This patch alters the `EnumSerializer` class to use the name of the Enum member instead of its value. This change modifies the `serialize` method of `EnumSerializer` to return the name of the Enum member, ensuring names remain stable even if values change due to translation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function for the issue, `serialize` within the `EnumSerializer` class. The `serialize` method is responsible for displaying Enum members, aligning this change to address the reported problem directly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict any of the identified code spans or existing logic. It looks compatible with how serializers and Enums operate within the discussed context.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe revised `serialize` method correctly outputs the Enum member's name rather than its value, thus addressing the reported issue. However, scrutiny is necessary since common mistakes in patches involve improper string interpolation and ensuring edge cases are covered like model loading from legacy migrations. This change shifts from directly using `value`:\n```python\nreturn \"%s.%s(%s)\" % (module, enum_class.__name__, v_string), imports\n```\n- To accurately referencing the Enum name:\n```python\nreturn \"%s.%s['%s']\" % (module, enum_class.__name__, self.value.name), imports\n```\nA crucial verification is confirming successful migration generation and accurate reflecting untouched localized mapped fields for Enum in previous migrations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Relevant because the change needs to specify how the name of the enum should be serialized instead of the value.\n- **IntegerChoices**: This class is for creating enumerated integer choices. While it extends functionality related to enums, it's not immediately relevant to the `CharField` enum serialization problem but gives contextual insight into how Django handles different enums.\n- **TextChoices**: Similar to `IntegerChoices`, this handles string choices and is for creating enumerated string choices. Offers additional context but is similar to above.\n- **Choices**: This is the base class for creating enum-based choices. Helpful in understanding the hierarchy and rationale of `EnumSerializer`.\n- **CharField**: The field type directly in the issue description where the default enum value problem arises. It's important because the fix should cater to how enums are handled in relation to `CharField`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n- Hunks Modified:\n  1. Changes related to `EnumSerializer` class and its method `serialize`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **First Hunk**:\n  - **Before Patch**:\n    - The `EnumSerializer`'s `serialize` method was serializing enum's value.\n  - **After Patch**:\n    - The patch modifies the serialization method to use the enum's name (`self.value.name`) instead of its value. It also changes the `return` statement to use square brackets `[%s]` that conform to the enum name, thus fixing the described issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. It directly changes the `EnumSerializer` class's `serialize` method, which is responsible for how enums are serialized in Django migrations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces one potential issue:\n- The change to use enum names assumes enum classes are string keys usable within sq-commerce brackets. This might not be fully tested across all edge cases.\n\nAdditionally, while hypothetical compatibility seems intact, rigorous testing is recommended to ensure situations like `IntegerChoices` where enums are not string based.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to address the main part of the issue correctly, replacing `enum.value` with `enum.name` to ensure the serialized output is enum names. This approach should generally fix the described problem. However, there might be scope assumes enums implement __name__ and ensures backward field compatibility conversion tests for all valid enum types in Django.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the issue**:\n   <issue_exp>\n   The issue is that when using Enum objects as default values for CharField in Django models, the generated migration files currently use the value of the Enum rather than its name. This creates problems when the Enum values are translated into different languages, since the translated values no longer match the Enum values and raise migration errors. The correct behavior should be for the migration files to use the name of the Enum (which is language-agnostic) instead of its value.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**:\n   - List of span ids:\n     - span_id: EnumSerializer\n     - span_id: serializer_factory\n     - span_id: EnumSerializer.serialize\n     - span_id: IntegerChoices\n     - span_id: TextChoices\n     - span_id: Choices\n     - span_id: CharField\n   \n   <code_span_exp>\n   - **span_id: EnumSerializer**: This span points to the EnumSerializer class which seems to be responsible for serializing Enum objects. Relevant because this class will likely need to be modified to serialize the name of the Enum instead of the value.\n   - **span_id: serializer_factory**: This function is responsible for returning a specific serializer for a given value, which will need changes to support the new serialization format for Enums.\n   - **span_id: EnumSerializer.serialize**: This method within the EnumSerializer class currently handles how the Enum is serialized, specifically serializing its value. This method will need to be modified to serialize the name.\n   - **span_id: IntegerChoices**: Defines an integer-based Enum class. Relevant as it may utilize the EnumSerializer.\n   - **span_id: TextChoices**: Defines a string-based Enum class. Similarly relevant.\n   - **span_id: Choices**: Base class for creating enumerated choices (Enums), which is integral to understanding how Enums operate within the Django codebase.\n   - **span_id: CharField**: The CharField class defines the field type presumably used in the models, ultimately needing the correct serialization for Enum defaults.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n   - List of modified hunks:\n     1. The code has been updated to use the name of the Enum for serialization and modifies the import constructs accordingly.\n   \n   <patch_exp>\n   - The EnumSerializer class's serialize method has been modified:\n     - Added a comment explaining the change.\n     - Changed `v_string, v_imports = serializer_factory(self.value.value).serialize()` to `name_string, name_imports = serializer_factory(self.value.name).serialize()` to handle the serialization of Enum names instead of values.\n     - Changed the return value of serialize to use square brackets and the string representation of the Enum name.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**:\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch appropriately targets the EnumSerializer class's serialize method, which is where the serialization format of Enums is determined.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch seems well-contained to the EnumSerializer.serialize method. It doesn't introduce obvious new issues. However, undocumented issues could arise if there are other parts in the codebase that depend on the old serialization using the Enum value. This should be checked further for a comprehensive validation.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch addresses the described issue by changing the serialization of Enum objects to use their names. This prevents problems that arise when Enum values are translated. Common mistakes such as logic errors or wrong function/method targeting have not been detected here. However, thorough testing is always required when updating core serializer functionality to catch edge cases.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
