The explicit handling ensures that the shape `(0, x)` is correctly maintained despite matrix concatenation. No common LLM-related mistakes such as improperly placed logic or misunderstanding the problem appear to be present in this patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aims to address the discrepancy by special handling of zero-row matrices, mimicking sympy 1.0 behavior by explicitly summing column lengths for total column count. Though logically sound, an actual run or test could verify if `(0, 6)` is achieved. There is potential edge case handling needing closer evaluation considering negative rows or alternative 0-dimensional cases. Among techniques: \n- Ensure zero-element safeguards (gen breaking)\n- More detailed test coverage crucial to ensuring holistic rectification and non-intrusion clauses aligned to pre-defined hstack structures sans non-delimit matched or zero cell failures.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

Specifically, in sympy 1.0, horizontally stacking empty matrices (with zero rows) would result in a single matrix containing all columns from the inputs. However, in sympy 1.1, this same operation produces inconsistent results where the output does not have the correct total number of columns.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n   \n   **List of span ids:**\n   - MatrixShaping\n   - MatrixShaping.row_join\n   - MatrixShaping.hstack\n\n   <code_span_exp>\n   - **MatrixShaping:** This class provides basic matrix shaping and the ability to extract submatrices, relevant because it likely includes or manages the `hstack` and `vstack` operations.\n   - **MatrixShaping.row_join:** This method concatenates two matrices by joining them along the rows. The issue in the `hstack` method is closely related to how this operation concatenates matrices, particularly in the edge case where matrices are empty or of incompatible shapes.\n   - **MatrixShaping.hstack:** This class method forms a new matrix by repeatedly applying the `row_join` method. The function's specifics are directly relevant to addressing the inconsistency in concatenating matrices horizontally (i.e., handling the empty matrices' shape correctly).\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\n   **List of modified hunks:**\n   - Hunk 1: Modification in `hstack` method\n   - Hunk 2: Modification in `vstack` method\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - **Hunk 1 (hstack modification):** This patch adds a conditional check to handle the case where all the input matrices have zero rows. If true, it computes the total number of columns of all input matrices and returns a new zero-row matrix with this total column count.\n   - **Hunk 2 (vstack modification):** This patch adds a similar check for the `vstack` method (assumed analogous to `hstack` but for vertical stacking) to handle cases where all input matrices have zero columns. If true, it computes the total number of rows of all input matrices and returns a new zero-column matrix with this total row count.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n   \n   <correct_location_exp>The patch is addressing the correct methods by enhancing the `hstack` and `vstack` functions with edge case handling for entirely empty row or column matrices respectively.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n   \n   <new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce any new issues. It includes additional conditionals that handle edge cases without modifying the existing logic for non-edge-case scenarios. The new code is both defensive and isolated, ensuring consistent results.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>The patch effectively addresses the reported issue of inconsistent results when stacking empty matrices by handling zero-row (in `hstack`) and zero-column (in `vstack`) matrices. The patch ensures that the total number of columns or rows is considered, correctly forming the resultant matrix shape. Additionally, this approach aligns with the library's typical matrix handling strategy, acknowledging edge-case behaviors intrinsic to matrix operations.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:**\n\n<score>9</score>\n"

The desired behavior is to have the same number of columns as the sum of the input matrices' columns even if all have zero rows.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n#### List of Span IDs:\n- MatrixShaping\n- MatrixShaping.row_join\n- MatrixShaping.hstack\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span `MatrixShaping` (`sympy/matrices/common.py`):\n  This span indicates that the issue lies within the methods responsible for matrix shaping and modifying the matrix shape.\n\n- Span `MatrixShaping.row_join` (`sympy/matrices/common.py`):\n  This method in the Matrix Shaping class is used to join matrices horizontally by stacking the rows of the matrices side by side. The issue at hand directly involves horizontal stacking (hstack), which performs iterative row joins.\n\n- Span `MatrixShaping.hstack` (`sympy/matrices/common.py`):\n  This method stacks multiple matrices horizontally using the `row_join` method (this matches stack horizontally), which is directly responsible for the issue reported.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks:\n1. Modification in `hstack` method of the `MatrixShaping` class.\n2. Modification in `vstack` method of the `MatrixShaping` class.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Modification in `hstack` method:\n  - **Original Code**:\n    ```python\n    return reduce(kls.row_join, args)\n    ```\n  - **New Code**:\n    ```python\n    # Handle zero-row matrices\n    if all(arg.rows == 0 for arg in args):\n        total_cols = sum(arg.cols for arg in args)\n        return cls.zeros(0, total_cols)\n    return reduce(kls.row_join, args)\n    ```\n  - **Explanation**:\n    The patch adds a condition that checks if all matrices have zero rows. If so, it calculates the total number of columns from all input matrices and returns a zero-row matrix with total columns.\n\n- Modification in `vstack` method:\n  - **Original Code**:\n    ```python\n    return reduce(kls.col_join, args)\n    ```\n  - **New Code**:\n    ```python\n    # Handle zero-column matrices\n    if all(arg.cols == 0 for arg in args):\n        total_rows = sum(arg.rows for arg in args)\n        return cls.zeros(total_rows, 0)\n    return reduce(kls.col_join, args)\n    ```\n  - **Explanation**:\n    Similarly to `hstack`, the patch handles zero-column matrices independently, calculates the total rows, and returns a zero-column matrix with the sum of rows.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the relevant `hstack` function where the issue of matrix shape discrepancy occurs. It also modifies the `vstack` function related to the stacking of columns vertically, which is part of the matrix shaping methods set.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues seem to be introduced by this patch. The changes added conditions that specifically handle the edge case of zero-row or zero-column matrices without altering the existing embody logic if the condition is unmet.\nHowever, making sure all `arg.rows == 0` is checked correctly in context to overall surrounding demands may need further dynamic test cases making clarity checkpoint well passed now.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue appropriately by handling matrices with zero rows in `hstack` and zero columns in `vstack` correctly, making sure their concatenation logic considers the sum of column and row counts. While this perfectly `lgtm` correctly fixes behavioral disparity suffices described examples typically pip pass elaborating version-relevanceary ran.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Scoring\n\n<score>10</score>"
