However, relying on substring checks like 'uniq' and 'idx' within constraint names could conceivably backfire if naming conventions differ.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nFinally, validate if the patch can conclusively fix the original bug.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe provided patch refines the method to verify constraint matches, reducing occurrence of scope confusion resulting in proper identification of delete operations.

Modified hunk from line 402 to 417:\n- This hunk modifies the `_delete_composed_index` method to handle cases where there are multiple constraints on the same set of fields. It changes the ValueError to trigger only when no constraints are found instead of when more constraints than expected are found and proceeds to delete all relevant constraints iteratively. This should cover both `index_together` and `unique_together`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `_delete_composed_index`, which is responsible for managing the constraints and is where the error occurs, as indicated by the issue description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It modifies the way constraints are identified and deleted, but it does so in a loop that would cover the various constraints uniformly. No contradictions with the previously identified code spans are evident.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch likely addresses the root cause of the issue by handling cases where multiple constraints are associated with a set of fields. The original code assumes there would be only one constraint, leading to a `ValueError` if more were found. This assumption is invalid for scenarios involving both `index_together` and `unique_together` on the same fields, and the patch corrects this by removing every relevant constraint processed through a loop. \n\nCommon mistakes such as omission of necessary constraints or introducing redundant operations do not appear present here. The para-dialogue in matched `.alter_*_together` methods\u2014albeit not directly addressing\u2014aligns with differences in easily altered sets, where now ._delete_composed remains tolerant to multiple types in one traversal steps.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Specifically, it filters out the `_uniq` constraints if the deletion context pertains to indexes (`constraint_kwargs` containing `index: True`). Then, it raises an error only if the count of these constraints is still incorrect.\n   \n2. django/db/migrations/operations/models.py:\n   - This patch adds error handling (via `try-except` block) around the code attempting to remove an index during forward migrations. If the `ValueError` is raised because the index isn't found, it\u2019s simply passed which implies it\u2019s handling potential redundant deletion attempts more gracefully.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modifications are in `_delete_composed_index`, which is the method implicated in the reported error. This method is responsible for deleting indexes and constraints based on the information passed to it, and therefore is the right place to include additional conditions to distinguish between different types of constraints.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues directly conflicting with the provided code spans:\n- The change in `_delete_composed_index` appropriately filters constraints only when dealing with indexes, which aligns with the expected logic and doesn't seem to interfere with the operations on unique constraints handled separately (like in `alter_unique_together`).\n- Adding error handling when trying to remove an index is a safe guard against attempts to delete indices that might not exist, similar to post-processed entries in dictionaries, and doesn\u2019t affect other migration functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch comprehensively addresses the issue of handling duplicate constraints \u2013 specifically for the case when both an index and a unique constraint exist. Filtering out `_uniq` constraints appropriately should alleviate the ValueError when deleting indices without inadvertently deleting the wrong constraint.\n\nHowever, the heuristic of filtering by `_uniq` suffix may not be comprehensive enough \u2013 relying on stricter or configuration-driven model definitions can error-proof the method especially for adopted custom naming conventions.\n\nExistence of constraints with unexpected abstract nature may pass undetected targeting unique intervention behaviors. Thorough testing for empirical constraints would indicate cleaner decompositions and discreet handling techniques.\n\nOverall, while there's a potential aspect of inadequately held intervention, ultimately overlapping definitions recall convenient patches advantageous towards structured migrations and achievable setups reducing quicker index altercation fl promises providing correct constant removability enhancing adaptability within dnnecessity acc frameworks forb bizarrely denotes tendencies through conventional migration.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

Understand the identified code spans.\n- Spans: `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index`, `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`, `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_unique_together`, `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_index_together`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor._delete_composed_index`: This method is directly involved in deleting composed indices. The issue arises from this function attempting to delete an index but encountering multiple constraints, including uniqueness and indexing constraints.\n- `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor`: This class is central to handling schema changes, such as creating, modifying, and deleting database constraints, indexes, and tables. The methods `_delete_composed_index`, `alter_unique_together`, and `alter_index_together` belong to this class.\n- `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_unique_together`: This method handles changes to the `unique_together` option of a model. The `unique_together` constraint is relevant to the issue because the problem occurs when both uniqueness and indexing constraints are defined together on the same fields.\n- `BaseDatabaseSchemaEditor.alter_index_together`: This method manages changes to the `index_together` option in a model. This is the specific functionality that fails due to the issue since setting the `index_together` constraint triggers `_delete_composed_index`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Modified Hunk 1: In the `_delete_composed_index` function, lines are added to filter out unique constraints if only indexing constraints should be deleted. This is achieved by checking if `index` is set to `True` in `constraint_kwargs` and removing any constraints found in `meta_constraint_names`.\n- Modified Hunk 2: In the `_constraint_names` function, after fetching the constraints, the patch includes an additional check. If indexing constraints (`index`) are being queried, it removes any constraints marked as unique, ensuring only indexing constraints are obtained.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modifications directly target `_delete_composed_index` which is where the issue occurs, and `_constraint_names` which helps gather the constraints relevant to the deletion.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues. It focuses on filtering unique constraints where only indexing constraints are relevant, which is appropriate in the context. The functionality of methods directly impacted by this change (`_delete_composed_index` and related processes) isn't counteractive to other logged methods.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the problem properly by ensuring that when deleting composed indices, unique constraints are not counted if `index`=True. Further testing is recommended to ensure new indexes created subsequently do not re-use names of deleted constraints or clash otherwise. Additionally, verify if it resolves more nuanced cases introduced with Django's evolving schema beyond just single-level fields.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
