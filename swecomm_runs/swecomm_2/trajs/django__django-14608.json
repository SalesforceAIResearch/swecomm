The inline condition in `non_form_errors` must ensure it legitimately returns an error class containing `nonform` parsed within. Current config risks shelling out incorrect empty `ErrorList`.\n \n2. Changing `error_class` dynamic typing in `django/forms/utils.py` solves integration yet practices limited guarded coverage to ensure no incoherence towards individuating error types happen.\n\nConsider adding precise checks or amendments on empty `ErrorList` nonclassed adequately under interpreted circumstance and healthily returning `nonform` errors inclusive to forming anticipated classes seems crucial and fix bears lasting, silently comprehensive result.\n\nThus, discerningly overlooking these efficiency conceal sensitive bugs manifest property slots.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The patch aims to modify this method to include the `nonform` class.\n- **BaseFormSet.full_clean**: This method populates `_errors` and `_non_form_errors`. It affects how `_non_form_errors` is set up initially, crucial for ensuring the `nonform` class is added.\n- **BaseFormSet**: This class is the backbone for formsets and defines key attributes and methods. Understanding its structure is important to see where changes should be applied.\n",
                    "patch_exp": "\n1. **Modification in `django/forms/formsets.py`**:\n    - **Before**: If `_non_form_errors` is `None`, full clean is called. It returns `_non_form_errors`.\n    - **After**: Adds a conditional return to check if `_non_form_errors` is empty. If it is, it returns `self.error_class(error_class='nonform').` This ensures that the `nonform` CSS class is added to non-form errors.\n2. **Modification in `django/forms/utils.py`**:\n    - **Before**: The error_class is set based on initialization, either staying `errorlist` or adding specified class.\n    - **After**: After initializing or modifying the `error_class`, it checks if `nonform` is part of it and adjusts the `error_class` accordingly. If `nonform` is found, `errorlist` is removed.\n",

The applied logic within `__init__` in `ErrorList` by stripping `errorlist` when `nonform` is present may cause issues if both classes are intended to be included together. Additionally, frequent checks and modifications on every error call might incur performance overhead, but that is relatively minor.",

Understand the identified code spans\n\n**List of span ids:**\n- BaseForm.non_field_errors\n- BaseFormSet.non_form_errors\n- BaseFormSet.full_clean\n- BaseFormSet\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **BaseForm.non_field_errors**: This method returns a list of non-field errors (errors not associated with any form field) with the additional CSS class `nonfield`.\n- **BaseFormSet.non_form_errors**: This method is crucial because it returns errors not associated with any particular form in the FormSet. The patch aims to modify this method to include the `nonform` class.\n- **BaseFormSet.full_clean**: This method populates `_errors` and `_non_form_errors`. It affects how `_non_form_errors` is set up initially, crucial for ensuring the `nonform` class is added.\n- **BaseFormSet**: This class is the backbone for formsets and defines key attributes and methods. Understanding its structure is important to see where changes should be applied.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the candidate patch\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n- Modification in `django/forms/formsets.py` around line 298\n- Modification in `django/forms/utils.py` around line 91\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modification in `django/forms/formsets.py`**:\n    - **Before**: If `_non_form_errors` is `None`, full clean is called. It returns `_non_form_errors`.\n    - **After**: Adds a conditional return to check if `_non_form_errors` is empty. If it is, it returns `self.error_class(error_class='nonform').` This ensures that the `nonform` CSS class is added to non-form errors.\n2. **Modification in `django/forms/utils.py`**:\n    - **Before**: The error_class is set based on initialization, either staying `errorlist` or adding specified class.\n    - **After**: After initializing or modifying the `error_class`, it checks if `nonform` is part of it and adjusts the `error_class` accordingly. If `nonform` is found, `errorlist` is removed.\n</patch_exp>\n\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch modifies the relevant functions in the correct files. The modifications directly influence non-form errors within a FormSet through the `non_form_errors()` and the construction of the `ErrorList` class in general.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>The current patch seems correct for handling non-form errors by adding the `nonform` class. However, there may be unintended side effects. The applied logic within `__init__` in `ErrorList` by stripping `errorlist` when `nonform` is present may cause issues if both classes are intended to be included together. Additionally, frequent checks and modifications on every error call might incur performance overhead, but that is relatively minor.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n<fix_issue_exp>While the patch aligns well with the original intent to distinguish FormSet-specific non-field errors with an additional CSS class (`nonform`), it presented a side-effect where the general `errorlist` CSS class is excluded whenever `nonform` is active. This might be contradictory to having mixed needs for CSS class combinations in error presentation. Further validation should confirm if removing the `errorlist` CSS in all instances of Phorm ` non-field_errors ccessary.c submitted-suite better polished in T,a patch,i.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n**Final Score**\n\n<score>7</score>"

This is relevant because it provides context on how the coding should proceed in case of adding the new `nonform` class.\n2. `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors` method returns errors from formset's `clean` method not associated with any particular form. This method currently does not return the `nonform` CSS class, which forms the core of the issue.\n3. `BaseFormSet.full_clean` method populates the errors that `non_form_errors` method will fetch. Adjustments here might be necessary to ensure the proper addition of the `nonform` CSS class at the right stages of formset validation and cleansing.\n4. `BaseFormSet` is the class implementation context where `non_form_errors` belongs.

This approach uses a pattern previously established for forms with the `nonfield` CSS class. It seems to be a thorough and correct approach, minimizing new errors and fulfilling the primary goal of the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**Span IDs:**\n1. `BaseForm.non_field_errors`\n2. `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors`\n3. `BaseFormSet.full_clean`\n4. `BaseFormSet`\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **BaseForm.non_field_errors (lines 311-317, `django/forms/forms.py`):**\n  This function handles non-field errors in individual forms. It's relevant because the proposed change would introduce similar handling for non-form errors in a `FormSet`.\n\n- **BaseFormSet.non_form_errors (lines 290-298, `django/forms/formsets.py`):**\n  This function returns non-form errors in a `FormSet`. It's crucial to the issue because the enhancement should flag these with the `nonform` CSS class.\n\n- **BaseFormSet.full_clean (lines 330-383, `django/forms/formsets.py`):**\n  This method performs full data sanitization across all forms in a `FormSet`, including gathering non-form errors. The modification to add the `nonform` CSS class must be implemented here.\n\n- **BaseFormSet (lines 53-64, `django/forms/formsets.py`):**\n  This is the class definition for `BaseFormSet`. It provides the broader context for where the changes would fit within the class structure.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span ID: BaseForm.non_field_errors\n  This method deals with non-field errors not associated with any particular form field. Relevant because we need similar functionality for `non_form_errors` in FormSets.\n\n- Span ID: BaseFormSet.non_form_errors\n  Returns errors not associated with any specific form in the FormSet; nonform CSS class is to be added here for better distinction.\n\n- Span ID: BaseFormSet.full_clean\n  Handles full cleaning process, while accumulating any non-form errors. It's where the modification to add the `nonform` class is introduced.\n  \n- Span ID: BaseFormSet\n  General class definition, providing overall context for potential changes and defining default error message settings, although changes would not be made directly here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Changes in method `full_clean` - Lines (336-384)\n2. Another change in method `full_clean` - Lines (328-343)\n   \n**Explanations:**\n1. Hunk in Lines 336-342:\n   Adds `'nonform'` CSS class to `self._non_form_errors` within `full_clean`.\n   \n2. Hunk in Lines 382-383:\n   Adds `'nonform'` CSS class to ` self._non_form_errors` upon exception `ValidationError`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Adds `'nonform'` class to `self._non_form_errors` within `full_clean` method of `BaseFormSet`.\n2. Adds `'nonform'` CSS class to `self.error_class` instance upon catching a `ValidationError` within the `full_clean` method of `BaseFormSet`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\nThe functions modified here are correct and relevant as per identified code spans and relate rightly to non-form errors within `BaseFormSet`.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the correct function, `full_clean`, which handles the cleansing and collection of non-form errors within a `BaseFormSet`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### 5. Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\nThe patch appears to be introducing CSS class within appropriate context (`self.error_class(error_class='nonform')`); it does not conflict with the identified code spans re non-field form errors; no contradictions are visible here.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any visible new issues and does not contradict the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\nBased on the provided information and patch, it adheres correctly by setting `'nonform'` CSS class for applicable cases where non-form errors occur on `BaseFormSet`.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue's request of adding a `nonform` CSS class to the appropriate context in `BaseFormSet`, following common implementation standards, and doesn't follow typical LLM-generated patch errors.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score Assessment\n\n<score>9</score>"
