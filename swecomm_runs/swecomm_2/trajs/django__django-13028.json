Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by bypassing the constraint checking for model instances, which was causing `NotSupportedError`. The approach is sensible as it leverages `hasattr` to conditionally skip the check only when appropriate (i.e., the expression is a model instance). The adjustment allows typical query objects to remain insulated from raising errors due to the `filterable` flag.

The error trace indicates that this is related to an attempt to filter `value` in `ProductMetaData` objects based on the `metadata_type`. Changing the field name from `filterable` to `filterable_test` circumvents the issue.\n</issue_exp>\n\nStep 2: Understand the identified code spans. First provide a list of the span ids.\nCode Span IDs:\n1. Query.check_filterable\n2. Query.build_filter\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Query.check_filterable: This method in Django's ORM raises a `NotSupportedError` if an expression used in a WHERE clause has an attribute `filterable` set to `False`.

Instead of addressing the issue related to `filterable` attribute causing `NotSupportedError` in filtering operations, it merely introduces two new model migration scripts (`Plateforme` and `Produit`).

Nonetheless, the migration related patch is entirely off base regarding fixing the reported issue, highlighting an understanding problem.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nStep 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch cannot fix the issue because it concentrates solely on database migrations for irrelevant model creation without addressing the defect where the `filterable` attribute setting in conditions triggers unwanted exceptions. \nThis misalignment between the issue and proposed solution (it does not touch anything about QuerySet filtering criteria checks or elimination of enforcing `filterable` assessment, for `False`, default logic).\nSuch a mistake includes the LLM commonly failing to navigate to a pertinent logic path clarifying the specific compositional topic while strictly modifying unrelated spans involving schema-sublevel operations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>0</score>"

The user found a workaround by renaming the `label` field to `filterable_test`, but this is not a fix.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- Identified Span IDs: `Query.check_filterable`, `Query.build_filter`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Query.check_filterable`: It is the function that raises the `NotSupportedError` if the expression is not filterable. This is directly the function throwing the error when `filterable` is set to `False`.\n\n- `Query.build_filter`: It builds the filters applied to the query. The function includes calls to `check_filterable`, ensuring that the expressions can be used in a `WHERE` clause within SQL queries. Significant as `_filter_or_exclude` in the traceback calls this function.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n- Modified Hunk: `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, lines around 1124-1126\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `check_filterable` method to add an early return if an expression is not filterable, thus avoiding unnecessary further processing. This modification ensures that if an expression is flagged as non-filterable, the function will return immediately after raising the error.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `check_filterable`, which is directly responsible for raising the `NotSupportedError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch has Contradictions with Identified Code Spans\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere's no direct contradiction between the identified code spans and the patch. The early return does not interfere with the logic in `build_filter`, which makes sense upon invoking `check_filterable`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Verify if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not inherently fix the original issue detailed in the description, which suggests a problem when using non-filterable fields. Adding an early return in `check_filterable` might optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary recursion, but it does not address why filtering with a `filterable` set to `False` should throw `NotSupportedError`. This may not align with the user's needs or desired behavior.\nHence, the actual issue, which is handling non-filterable fields, remains unsolved. Thus, while technically optimizes code, the patch doesn't tackle the root cause.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>\n0\n</score>"

The added `return` statement doesn't provide a mechanism to handle the filtering with `filterable=False`. Instead, it terminates the checks early, which may avoid recursive checks but doesn't rectify the inability to perform the intended filter operation on the `ProductMetaData` model.\nThus, while minor performance optimization, the core problem is not genuinely addressed. Additionally, no mechanism has been provided to handle or bypass the restriction on the `filterable` attribute.\n\nOverall, the patch is closer to a minor code efficiency tweak rather than a concrete fix for the described issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>0</score>"

The issue appears when attempting to filter `ProductMetaData` instances based on their `metadata_type`. The error traceback indicates that the `check_filterable` method in Django's ORM is raising this error because it identifies the attribute `metadata_type` as not filterable.\n\n<issue_exp>The problem arises when a Django queryset filter tries to evaluate on an attribute flagged with `filterable=False`, leading to a `NotSupportedError`. </issue_exp>\n\n## Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n### Code Span IDs\n- Query.check_filterable\n- Query.build_filter\n\n**Relevant Explanations:**\n\n### Query.check_filterable\n**Relevant Lines:**\nRaw Lines:\n```python\n1125:     def check_filterable(self, expression):\n1126:         \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n1127:         if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n1128:             raise NotSupportedError(\n1129:                 expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n1130:                 'clause.'\n1131:             )\n1132:         if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):\n1133:             for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():\n1134:                 self.check_filterable(expr)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis method examines whether an expression is \"filterable\". If an expression or any of its sub-expressions have a `filterable=False` attribute, the method raises a `NotSupportedError`. Recursive sub-expressions extentuation happens through a further recursive check.\n\n### Query.build_filter\n**Relevant Lines:**\nRaw Lines:\n```python\n1201:     def build_filter(self, filter_expr, branch_negated=False, current_negated=False,\n1258:         if check_filterable:\n1259:             self.check_filterable(reffed_expression)\n...\n1268:         if check_filterable:\n1269:             self.check_filterable(value)\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe `build_filter` method is used to construct a `WhereNode` for filter clauses but doesn\u2019t immediately add it to the query. This Code Span definitely shows calls to `check_filterable` as part of its execution path, surveying primary and conditioned steps of the intended builting process.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- SPAN_ID: \"Query.check_filterable\": This method ensures that the given expression is filterable and raises an error if it is not.\n- SPAN_ID: \"Query.build_filter\": Incorporates calls to the `check_filterable` method indicating there exists cross-relational check role within current context object which might build a failing traversal case assailing our problem step.

prevent further processing if not filterable. This fix makes sure further recursive calls to sub-expressions are short-circuited.\n\n### Patch Explanation\n<patch_exp>The patch modifies Query.check_filterable by introducing an early return statement after raising NotSupportedError when encountering unfilterable attributes. This prevents further processing of sub-expressions, making checks more robust.</patch_exp>\n\n## Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n### Correct Function Evaluation\n<correct_location_exp>The patch updates the correct function, `check_filterable` method, aiming to skip unnecessary further processing upon determining an expression is unfilterable earlier as intended and documented portions tend request willing highest lifecycle expressional terms normally coupled journey fixing posedisting checks correctly stepping recursively bound valid role nesting result entries"
