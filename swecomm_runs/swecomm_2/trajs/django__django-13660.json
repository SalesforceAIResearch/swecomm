It is the part of the code where globals need to be supplied to `exec` to avoid failures in name resolution, which is the root of the reported issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n\n- Importing Django at the beginning of the file.\n- Modifying the `handle` method to introduce `minimal_globals`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch adds an import statement for Django (`import django`) at the beginning of the file to ensure that Django can be correctly referenced within the `minimal_globals` dictionary.\n\n2.

This should adequately address the `NameError` without causing additional problems.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch follows a logical approach by importing Django and supplying a minimal global context to `exec`, addressing the root cause of the issue. However, it could miss additional dependencies that users might expect when using the `-c` option. More globals may need to be included, considering the environment where the script would be executed. It is essential to test more edge cases to ensure everything needed is captured in `minimal_globals`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Scoring the Patch:**\n\n<score>8</score>"

This tackles the `NameError` that arises when the provided Python command relies on the Django package. There don't seem to be common mistakes here, such as usage of incorrect names, missed imports, or unattached variables. Although, one minor enhancement could involve adding other potentially necessary built-ins for a fuller global environment.

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue describes a problem with the Django shell command when it's executed in a way that passes Python code which includes functions (with the `-c` argument). The provided example shows that while such a command works correctly using plain Python (`python -c`), it fails when using Django (`python -m django shell -c`). The error arises because the `exec` function doesn't seem to have access to the `django` variable within the global context, causing a `NameError`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n**Identified Code Spans:**\n- `Command.handle`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Command.handle` (span_id=Command.handle):\n  This code span is relevant because it includes the method `handle`, where the command passed to the shell (`options['command']`) is executed using `exec`. The issue arises specifically within this part of the code, as the `exec` call does not have a dictionary with context leading to a `NameError` when functions attempt to access the `django` module.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Modified Hunks:**\n1. From the file `django/core/management/commands/shell.py` starting at line 84:\n<patch_exp>\n1) The patch modifies the handling of the `exec` command when a command is passed as an argument (`if options['command']:`). It now imports `django` to ensure it is imported and defines a `global_context` dictionary that includes the `__builtins__` and the imported `django`. This context is then passed as the second argument to the `exec` function to ensure access.\n\n2) Similarly, for executing the standard input (`if sys.platform != 'win32' and not sys.stdin.isatty() and select.select([sys.stdin], [], [], 0)[0]:`), it ensures `django` is imported and provides the same `global_context` dictionary to the `exec` function.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct function. The needed changes occur within the `handle` method, where the `exec` statements are executed.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any apparent new issues. It aligns with the recommendation given in the issue description to provide a dictionary containing at least the `django` module in the global context of `exec`. No contradictions with the identified code span (`Command.handle`) are observed.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the issue by providing the necessary context to the `exec` calls. By ensuring that the `django` module is explicitly included in the `global_context` dictionary passed to `exec`, the function definitions within the executed code will no longer result in a `NameError`. It effectively addresses the problem without introducing common errors such as modifying unrelated code, incorrect scope issues, or missing necessary imports.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Unlike the normal `python -c` command which works properly, the Django shell command encounters a `NameError` because the `exec` function in the `handle` method is not being given the correct set of globals. Specifically, the command's execution context does not recognize the `django` module. The issue proposes passing an empty dictionary to `exec` as the globals dictionary to avoid this error.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n#### List of Span IDs:\n- Command.handle\n\n#### Explanation for Each Identified Code Span:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Command.handle: This method is directly involved in executing Python code that is passed as a command via the Django shell. It contains the `exec` statements which are not using a proper context for execution, leading to the `NameError` described in the issue. This is the exact location where the problem occurs when Python code with functions is executed using the Django shell.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks:\n1. `   exec(options['command'])` to `exec(options['command'], {})`\n2. `   exec(sys.stdin.read())` to `exec(sys.stdin.read(), {})`\n\n#### Explanation for Each Modified Hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first hunk changes the `exec(options['command'])` statement to `exec(options['command'], {})`. This modification aims to pass an empty dictionary as the globals dictionary when executing the command provided via options.\n2.

This modification aims to ensure that when reading and executing Python commands from stdin, an empty dictionary is also passed as the globals dictionary for consistent behavior.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is indeed changing the correct function. The `handle` function within the `Command` class in `shell.py` is responsible for executing the provided command using `exec`. Because the reported issue occurs during this execution, changing the `exec` statements in this function to use a proper globals dictionary is targeting the root cause of the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces an empty dictionary as the globals dictionary for the exec statement. While this prevents the immediate `NameError`, it may inadvertently limit access to other necessary globals that the executed command might rely on. The patch sets a minimal global scope, which may break other functionalities if globals are expected by the command being executed.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch may fix the specific `NameError` issue by isolating the command within an empty globals dictionary, thus preventing clashes with undeclared variables like `django`. However, it may also inadvertently restrict access to other required global objects or built-in functions, limiting its general effectiveness. If the executed code expects certain globals (like built-in functions or variables), then it likely won't function as intended anymore.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\nGiven the analysis above:\n\n- The patch fixes the correct location.\n- There is a significant risk of new issues given that certain expected globals may be unavailable.\n\n<score>6</score>"
