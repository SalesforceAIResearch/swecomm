Understanding the identified code spans:\n- Span IDs: [SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects]\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan ID: SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects\n\nThis is the entire body of the `resolve_redirects` method in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. The code details how the method handles HTTP redirects by preparing new request objects for each redirect, adjusting URLs, methods, and headers accordingly. Given that the method's logic revolves around copying the original request for every new redirect, this span is directly relevant to the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understanding the candidate patch:\n- Modified hunks: [requests/sessions.py#79, requests/sessions.py#119]\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunk in `requests/sessions.py` from lines 83 to 101 (as per the diff):\nThe patch introduces a variable `current_method` to keep track of the effective HTTP method being used for redirects. Every prepared request within the loop now sets its method to this tracked `current_method` instead of the original request's method. This change aims to preserve method changes through consecutive redirects.\n\n2. Hunk in `requests/sessions.py` from lines 123 to 148 (as per the diff):\nThis part of the patch ensures that the `current_method` variable is updated whenever the redirection status code requires it (e.g., from POST to GET). The prepared request's method is explicitly set to this updated `current_method` for accurate HTTP method usage in the subsequent redirects. Adjustments include handling different redirect status codes (`see_other`, `found`, `moved`) by updating the `current_method` variable instead of the method directly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Correct function check:\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the `resolve_redirects` function of the `SessionRedirectMixin` class for the fix. This is the function responsible for handling redirects and therefore inherently tied to the redirection logic described in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. New issues check:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues. It handles the preservation of method changes by ensuring the tracked current method is used for each redirect and updated appropriately. It aligns well with the existing redirection handling logic. There is no contradiction with the behavior documented in other parts of resolve_redirect function as per the identified code span.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Issue resolution potential:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does address the root cause of the issue. By introducing the `current_method` variable, which tracks and maintains the effective request method throughout all subsequent redirects, it resolves the problem of reverting to the original method after intermediate redirects adjust the method type (e.g., POST to GET). This approach avoids the common mistakes of introducing logical inaccuracies while preserving the expected flow of redirects.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

When encountering a redirect, this method incorrectly initializes new redirected requests based on the original request\u2019s method rather than the current request method. This results in incorrect behavior, especially noted when handling a redirection chain that involves changing HTTP methods (e.g., from POST to GET). Instead of preserving the GET method in subsequent redirects, the method reverts to the original POST method, leading to erroneous HTTP operations.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2.

Through retaining changes to the HTTP request method due to varying status codes (like 303 converting a POST to GET), it avoids reverting to the original request method improperly. The adjustment prevents the same error mode in handling transitions pointed out initially in the issue within the code and seems potentially correct in theory and implementation.\n\nHowever, although it looks like it will fix the issue, I've observed that common pitfalls could include unintended edge cases based on nested redirections or differing HTTP status code comprehensions by `prepared_request` handling definitions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the Issue:**\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when the `resolve_redirects` method in the `Session` class handles redirections, it copies the original request rather than the modified request, leading to incorrect HTTP methods being retained across redirections. For example, if the initial request is a POST request and it gets redirected to a 303 status (which should change the method to GET), any subsequent 307 redirection unnecessarily reverts back to POST due to the original request being copied.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- Span IDS: [\"SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects\"]\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code span `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` is where the method `resolve_redirects` responsible for handling HTTP redirections is defined. The crux of this issue lies within this method specifically at the point where the redirection chains cause the HTTP method to be incorrectly retained. The relevant part occurs at line 91 of `requests/sessions.py`, where the request object is copied from the original request each time instead of maintaining the method changes incurred over successive redirections.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n- Modified hunks:\n  1. Original:\n  ```python\n  while resp.is_redirect:\n      prepared_request = req.copy()\n   ```\n  Modified:\n  ```python\n  while resp.is_redirect:\n      prepared_request = current_request.copy()\n   ```\n\n  2. Original:\n   ```python\n   method = req.method\n   ```\n   Modified:\n   ```python\n   method = prepared_request.method\n   ```\n\n  3. Code addition:\n   ```python\n   # Update current_request for the next iteration\n   current_request = prepared_request\n   ```\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch introduces a new variable `current_request` which is initialized with the original request `req`. It then uses `current_request.copy()` instead of `req.copy()` in each iteration to ensure that the modifications to the request are retained with each redirection.\n2. The method assignment `method = req.method` is modified to `method = prepared_request.method` to reflect the current HTTP method after redirections have been applied.\n3. A new line is added to update the `current_request` with the `prepared_request` at the end of each iteration to carry forward any changes made during the redirections.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function or Not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `resolve_redirects` in the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. This function is responsible for handling the logic related to redirections which is the core part of the raised issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues that contradict the identified code spans. The changes only ensure that the request object is properly updated during the redirection process. However, we need to ensure that `current_request` is consistently used and no edge cases break the logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by keeping track of the modified request instead of always copying the original request object. This should ensure that intermediate changes to the request method (such as converting POST to GET due to a 303 redirection) are retained in subsequent redirects. The approach used in the patch is logically sound and should successfully fix the problem as described.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:**\n\n<score>9</score>"

Instead of `req.copy()`, it uses `resp.request.copy()`, which ensures that the request being prepared for redirection is based on the last request used.\n  - Similarly, alters the method copy line to get the method from `prepared_request.method` instead of `req.method`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `Session.resolve_redirects` method, which is indeed the method responsible for handling the HTTP redirect responses and is directly linked to the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch isn't introducing new issues.

For subsequent iterations, the patch changes the function to use the request configuration from the previous redirect's response (`resp.request`). This ensures that any changes made to the method during one of the redirects are correctly carried forward in the subsequent redirects.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the correct location.

It's directly responsible for managing how incoming responses that signal a redirect (like 301, 302, 303, 307, etc.) are processed.\n   - Line 91 (req.copy()) is central to the issue because it creates a new request based on the original request, which causes the problem. This prevents the correct propagation of method adjustments made during an initial redirect (e.g., switching from POST to GET after a 303 See Other).\n   - Lines starting from 126 to 136 control how the method property of the new request is adjusted based on the redirect status codes: ensuring POST changes to GET if necessary and another related logic, but since they always copy from the original request first (line 138-139), these modifications might not stick correctly through a chain of redirected requests.</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunk 1:\n   - Explanation: On line 91, instead of copying the initial request \\(req.copy()\\) each time, the candidate patch uses \\(req.copy() if i == 0 else resp.request.copy()\\). This adjustment retains adjustments (like method changes) made during previous redirects as long as the initial request's number of redirects is diverse.\n\n2. Hunk 2:\n   - Explanation: The new line 139 assigns \\(req = prepared_request\\). After adjusting the method based on redirect logic, it sets req to use this modified `prepared_request`. This ensures that the next cycle in the redirection loop uses the last adjusted \"current\" request rather than the original request.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch is modifying the `resolve_redirects` method, which is at the center of the described issue. It is indeed addressing code responsible for handling request redirects.</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>No new issues appear to have been introduced, as the modifications focus specifically on adjusting how requests are prepared and preserving web request integrity across multiple redirects. Updating `req` on each iteration appropriately matches the goal stated in the issue, without contradicting other identified code spans.</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch fixes the issue by ensuring that the `resolve_redirects` method carries forward changes from previous redirects (like method changes) rather than always starting anew with the original request. This solution prevents incorrect method reversion exhibited in scenarios where the series of redirects alter the HTTP method (e.g., switching from POST to GET). By copying from the last responded request after the initial iteration and updating `req` every cycle, it addresses the misleading transfer problem as outlined in the issue description. Overall, it fulfills the correct behavior expected in `Session.resolve_redirects` without falling into common mistakes understood within this issue's scope.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
