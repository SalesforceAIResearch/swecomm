Specifically, there's an issue with how Django saves a `ForeignKey` relationship when the primary key is a `CharField`, resulting in the foreign key not being transmitted correctly:\n- When attempting to save a parent object with an uninitialized `product_id` and later setting its primary key, the parent object's `product_id` is set to an empty string.\n- This happens due to improper handling of primary key assignments within transactional atomic blocks when using `ForeignKey` fields.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue is about a bug where setting a parent object's foreign key on a child object results in data loss for parents with non-numeric primary keys.

It inserts logic specifically to handle the correct propagation of the FK value.\n\n<new_issues_exp>The candidate patch neither introduces new issues nor contradicts any known logic in the identified code spans.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\nThe patch seems robust regarding:\n- Properly checking and updating FK values upon PK changes in related objects.\n- No evident logical flaws; all needs are encapsulated in aim-age PK checks design.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch correctly addresses the core issue: ensuring updated primary keys for related objects accurately propagate to foreign key references.

If found to be either, instead of ignoring, it assigns the updated primary key to the foreign key field correctly, ensuring it gets the related object's proper primary key.\n</explanation>\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `Model.save` method which is a fundamental Django ORM database interaction point.

Thus, the added check happens logically when model instance relation fields such as ForeignKeys are involved.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe set check `or getattr(self, field.attname) == ''` added is concise in identifying discrepancies arising from uninitialized foreign key fields incorrectly initialized to an empty string.

Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n**Modified Hunks Explanation**:\n<patch_exp>\n- `contribute_to_class` additions: This change adds a new signal to `contribute_to_class` method in the `ForeignKey` class to update the related primary key just before saving the parent object. It uses the `pre_save` signal to set the parent's foreign key to the correct related object's primary key if it's present.\n- `get_db_prep_save` additions: This adds a check to handle cases where the value being saved is an instance of the related model and its primary key is not set. If the primary key is not set, it returns None to prevent setting an implicit foreign key value of an empty string.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Function or Not\n\nReviewing the described changes and the issue, both hunks focus on crucial points during the model saving mechanisms affected by ForeignKey fields.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting appropriate functions involved in saving models and ForeignKey relationships.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. New Issues\n\n**Assessment**:\n- The first modified hunk introduces a pre-save signal defined within the `contribute_to_class`.\n- The second hunk involves additional logic in `get_db_prep_save` to handle instances of unsaved related models properly.\n\nNeither seems to introduce immediate, direct contradictive behavior but might indirectly affect related save signals.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are apparent, but extra embeddable hooks and signals could introduce subtle side effects.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Fix the Issue\n\n**Common Mistakes Check**:\n- Adding excessive code/hooks rather than simplifying an approach.\n- Not considering certain signal/expected callback exceptions exhaustively.\n\nThe applied changes should reasonably address the issue but rely on additional signal handling instead of directly modifying central save logic.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears well-targeted and theoretically solves the identified issue with potentially added signaling flexibility at the cost of additional callback mechanism complexity.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7.

Logic added between existing `get_db_prep_save` function.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **After line 749 in `contribute_to_class` function**: A signal (`update_foreignkey_value`) is connected to the pre-save event of the parent model class, ensuring that the primary key of the related object (child) is assigned properly to the parent model's FK attribute.\n   \n2. **Between existing lines in `get_db_prep_save` function**: Checks if the value being saved is an instance of the related model and if its primary key (`.pk`) is `None`, returning `None` to avoid setting an incorrect (empty) key value.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The `contribute_to_class` function deals with setting up model attributes, and connecting the signal here ensures FK values are correctly assigned before saving. The modification in `get_db_prep_save` directly ensures that improper key values aren't mistakenly saved.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch correctly assigns FK values before save and guards against `None` keys; there are no visible contradictions with identified code spans given the design constraints already allow signal connections and save verification loops. Thus, it does not introduce new issues that are evident from the patch and identified spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue scenario where a previously unset primary key of a related child object leads to data loss. By connecting a pre-save signal ensuring updated FK assignments, and modifying `get_db_prep_save` to handle NULL keys correctly, the provided patch seems efficient for resolving the problem described. It correctly addresses the missed key propagation before saving.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score:**\n<score>9</score>\n"
