A validation test ensuring it doesn't break the normal HTML output process and correctly handles the EPUB configuration avoids common pitfalls remotely generated patches can have. For instance, if the test cases validate both EPUB creation (with and without module pages), it assures comprehensive case handling.\nHowever, it is essential here to observe that `env.config.viewcode_enable_epub` and `app.config.viewcode_enable_epub` might have differing ideal scopes and banned-reg-do accordingly opined scope documentation. Hence, diverted scores may indicate accompanying alterations more conceivably project-focused nature evaluations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>\n"

The expected behavior is that these pages should not be created in the EPUB when the configuration flag is explicitly set to disable it.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n- List of span IDs:\n  - `doctree_read`\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span `doctree_read` contains the function `doctree_read` in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`. Within this function, there is already a mechanism to check if the builder is for EPUB (`app.builder.name.startswith(\"epub\")`) and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`. If both conditions are met, some parts of the function are skipped by early return. Since this logic is essentially what needs to be replicated or utilized in the reported issue, this span is highly relevant.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\n- List of Modified Hunks:\n  - Changes between lines 185 and 187 in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk introduces a check in the `collect_pages` function. It inserts a condition to verify if the builder's name starts with \"epub\" and whether `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`. If both conditions are met, the function returns early, thereby preventing the creation of viewcode pages for the EPUB output when specified.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. The `collect_pages` function is where the viewcode pages are collected and produced. Adding the condition here effectively prevents the undesired generation of these pages in the EPUB output.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n     \n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict or introduce any new issues related to the identified code span `doctree_read`. Both places now have checks for the builder being EPUB and whether `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, ensuring that pages are not generated inappropriately.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue correctly by introducing the necessary condition within the `collect_pages` function. This prevents viewcode pages from being generated in EPUB when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. It aligns with the proper flow of handling builders in Sphinx and does not fall into common LLM mistakes like modifying irrelevant sections or misunderstanding config settings.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

It adds a check in `collect_pages` function to return early if the builder is for EPUB and `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to False. More specifically, it looks for `app.builder.name` starting with \"epub\" and checks the configuration `env.config.viewcode_enable_epub`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location. It adds a check in the `collect_pages` function, which is responsible for generating pages from modules. The condition being added checks explicitly if the builder is for EPUB format and returns early if the `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`, thereby preventing the generation of these pages incorrectly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues or contradict any identified code spans. The logic added mirrors code behavior seen in `doctree_read` function to safeguard against the generator running for EPUB when it should not.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch effectively prevents `collect_pages` function from generating module pages for EPUB when the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration is set to False. This correctly adheres to the configuration and fulfills the need described in the issue. The condition specifically targets EPUB builders without affecting other formats, capturing requirements accurately and complying with Sphinx extensibility and configuration context.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

This unexpected behavior occurs when running the `make html epub` command. The expected behavior is that the viewcode pages should not be created for EPUB output if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n## Understanding the Code Spans\n\n### List of Span IDs\n1. `doctree_read`\n\n### Explanation for Each Span\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **doctree_read**: This function is responsible for processing the doctree when generating documentation. There is already a condition implemented within this function to check if `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False` when building EPUB files. If the condition is met, the function exits early and does not process the viewcode modules.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n## Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n### List of Modified Hunks\n1. Code before line 185 in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`\n2. Code after line 185 in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`\n\n### Explanation for Each Hunk\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Code before line 185**: It grabs the environment object, `env`, from the builder. If `_viewcode_modules` is not found in the environment, it returns immediately.\n2. **Code after line 185**: Adds a check to see if the builder name starts with \"epub\" and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. If both conditions are true, the function returns immediately, ensuring that no viewcode pages are created for EPUB outputs when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## Check Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe modified code in this function appears to be at the correct location. The inside `if not hasattr(env, '_viewcode_modules'):` check guarantees that `_viewcode_modules` exists before proceeding, and adding the new condition before any further processing begins is appropriate because it stops any unnecessary work when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False` for an EPUB builder.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## Check New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo observed contradiction with the existing code span in `doctree_read`. In fact, the new code closely mirrors existing conditional logic, indicating good alignment with the current code design and structure.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully introduces an additional check right after establishing that `_viewcode_modules` exists. This check ensures no viewcode pages are created for EPUB outputs when `viewcode_enable_epub` is disabled (i.e., `False`). The methods used mimic the pre-existing logic found in the `doctree_read` function precisely, ensuring that logic inconsistency is minimized. Overall, this patch is logically sound and should fix the issue as stated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
