This function is directly responsible for handling and cleansing settings, including recursively handling dictionary keys. Since the issue pertains to insufficient cleansing of non-dictionary iterables, modifying this function is the appropriate approach.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking for New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modified code in the patch does not introduce new issues. It extends the existing recursive cleansing of dictionaries to also include lists and tuples. By using `type(value)(self.cleanse_setting(key, v) for v in value)`, it ensures other iterables are appropriately handled and converted back to their original types.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to resolve the identified issue by extending the `cleanse_setting` functionality to handle additional iterable types (lists and tuples). This ensures that all settings, regardless of their type, are thoroughly cleansed of sensitive information, addressing the insufficiency noted in the issue description. Common mistakes by LLMs such as wrong logic for type checks, improper recursion, or shallow manipulation seem to be avoided here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

It deals with dictionaries but does not handle other iterables, which is the root cause of this issue.\n- `SafeExceptionReporterFilter.get_safe_settings`: This function goes through the entire settings module and replaces the sensitive information with stars.

Compare the generated patch against common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly captures the essence of the problem by extending the `cleanse_setting` method to handle more types of iterables. The try-except block continues to mitigate any unforeseen errors without interruptions, and the structural adjustments do not interfere with existing functionality. This approach effectively fixes the noted issue without introducing new complications. It does not appear to have any common mistakes such as misunderstanding the requirement or making syntax errors.

The approach follows the existing mechanism for cleansing dictionaries, therefore respecting the encapsulated recursion design.

This ensures that settings structured as nested iterables are now effectively cleansed, closing the previously exposed gaps. Common mistakes in such patches include not properly retaining original data structures or mishandling combinations of types, but this patch correctly handles such cases. Therefore, it appears to reliably fix the described issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
