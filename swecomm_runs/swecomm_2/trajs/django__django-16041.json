Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n**Code Span Information Provided:**\n```markdown\n<code_span file_path=django/forms/formsets.py span_id=BaseFormSet.empty_form>\n(0258)     @property\n(0259)     def empty_form(self):\n(0260)         form = self.form(\n(0261)             auto_id=self.auto_id,\n(0262)             prefix=self.add_prefix(\"__prefix__\"),\n(0263)             empty_permitted=True,\n(0264)             use_required_attribute=False,\n(0265)             **self.get_form_kwargs(None),\n(0266)             renderer=self.renderer,\n(0267)         )\n(0268)         self.add_fields(form, None)\n(0269)         return form\n</code_span>\n```\n**List of Span IDs:** \n- BaseFormSet.empty_form\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe code span `BaseFormSet.empty_form` defines a property method `empty_form` which generates and returns an empty form, intended for display purposes within a formset. The specified issue occurs within this method when `form_kwargs` includes `empty_permitted` as it improperly triggers a KeyError. Thus, it is critical to adjust this method to prevent the inclusion or consideration of `empty_permitted` within the provided `form_kwargs`.\n\n<code_span_exp>The identified code span 'BaseFormSet.empty_form' is generating the empty_form for formsets. The inclusion of 'empty_permitted' in form_kwargs for this form is the presenting problem, hence relevant for the issue.</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n**Patches Provided:**\n\n**Before Patch:**\n```python\n@Property\ndef empty_form(self):\n    form = self.form(\n        auto_id=self.auto_id,\n        prefix=self.add_prefix(\"__prefix__\"),\n        empty_permitted=True,\n        use_required_attribute=False,\n        **self.get_form_kwargs(None),\n        renderer=self.renderer,\n    )\n    self.add_fields(form, None)\n    return form\n```\n\n**After Patch:**\n```python\n@property\ndef empty_form(self):\n    form_kwargs = self.get_form_kwargs(None)\n    form_kwargs.pop('empty_permitted', None)\n    form = self.form(\n        auto_id=self.auto_id,\n        prefix=self.add_prefix(\"__prefix__\"),\n        empty_permitted=True,\n        use_required_attribute=False,\n        **form_kwargs,\n        renderer=self.renderer,\n    )\n    self.add_fields(form, None)\n    return form\n```\n\n**Modified Hunk Explanation:**\n- The patch introduces a step to filter out the key 'empty_permitted' from `form_kwargs` if it exists by the `pop` method. This ensures any passed 'empty_permitted' value does not affect the `empty_form`.\n\n<patch_exp>The patch modifies the `empty_form` method to remove 'empty_permitted' from `form_kwargs` if it is present, ensuring it does not get inadvertently applied, thus preventing the KeyError.</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Function and Location Check\n\nThe modification is inside the method `empty_form`, explicitly addressing where the issue stems from.\n\n<correct_location_exp>This patch correctly targets the empty_form property method where the problem occurs due to the 'empty_permitted' presence.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Checking for New Issues\n\nWith the focus on removing the 'empty_permitted' from `form_kwargs`, the patch does not involve capacity for new clashes or present any contradictory need at the current observed utility.\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce new issues or conflict with the specified uses as per existing code spans.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Ensuring the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\nThe approach is a rational fix where the unwanted keyword is directly invalidated from essential argument packaging. However, close diligence teams confirming cross-top-level ends familiar with Django might usually bonus-exists for verifying efficiency parameters. Further inspection in complement forms be sanity of collectively verifying op mind.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch is likely covering the rectifiable ground step at output accidentally engagements. No additional arising constraints foresee or schema standards debillitions observed.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>9</score>"

This results in a `KeyError` because `empty_permitted` is not needed for the `empty_form` and should be ignored. The `empty_form` is not used for data validation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. List of span ids and explanations:\n- List of span ids: `BaseFormSet.empty_form`\n- Explanations:\n<code_span_exp>\n- `BaseFormSet.empty_form`: This code span shows the implementation of the `empty_form` property of the `BaseFormSet` class, which uses the `form_kwargs` that can contain the problematic `empty_permitted` key leading to the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. List of modified hunks and explanations:\n- List of modified hunks: \n  - Original line 97 to 112\n  - Modified lines 97 to 114\n- Explanations:\n<patch_exp>\nThe identified hunk adds a check after initializing `self.form_kwargs` to remove the `empty_permitted` key if it exists. By deleting this key from `self.form_kwargs`, the hunk aims to avoid the `KeyError` issue when forming the `empty_form`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Correct function check:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The issue is with managing `form_kwargs` within the formset structure, specifically when they make their way to the `empty_form` rendering. Thus, modifying this logic before usage helps to avoid the situation described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. New issue introduction check:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not evidently introduce new issues. It carefully ensures that the `form_kwargs` dictionary keys are being cleaned up for any `empty_permitted` entry, aligning well with the specified issue. There are no contradictions with the identified code span.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Issue fixing capability check:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully tackles the described issue by removing the `empty_permitted` key from the `form_kwargs` dictionary before it leads to a `KeyError` in the `empty_form`. This approach sidesteps the described runtime error and acknowledges that `empty_permitted` should not impact the `empty_form`. No indications of common LLM mistakes like incomplete contexts or incorrect logic flow are found.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the identified code spans.\n\nSpan IDs:\n- `BaseFormSet.empty_form`\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code span `BaseFormSet.empty_form` includes the property method for `empty_form` in the `BaseFormSet` class in `django/forms/formsets.py`. This method instantiates a form with attributes including `empty_permitted` set to `True`. This is relevant to the issue because this is where `empty_permitted` is being processed, and adjustments need to be made here to ignore the `empty_permitted` key in `form_kwargs`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch.\n\nModified Hunks:\n- `django/forms/formsets.py` lines 259-271\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `empty_form` method to ensure the `empty_permitted` key is not passed into the form instantiation. Specifically, the line `form_kwargs.pop('empty_permitted', None)` is added to remove `empty_permitted` from the keyword arguments obtained from `get_form_kwargs`. This adjustment prevents the potential `KeyError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly targets the `empty_form` property method in the `BaseFormSet` class, which is where the relevant issue occurs.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It correctly removes the `empty_permitted` key from the `form_kwargs` before creating the form, ensuring a `KeyError` will not occur. Also, it does not contradict any identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch seems to address the problem as described in the issue. By safely removing the `empty_permitted` keyword from the `form_kwargs`, the patch ensures that the `empty_form` is created without causing a `KeyError`. The fix aligns with the need to ignore `empty_permitted` for the `empty_form`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. Score.\n\n<score>10</score>"

Changes in empty_form property (`formsets.py` start_line=258)\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Changes in constructor (formsets.py start_line=92):**\n   The candidate patch modifies the constructor of the formset to filter out the 'empty_permitted' key from form_kwargs.\n\n2. **Changes in forms property (formsets.py start_line=199):**\n   The code is altered to ensure that when forms are instantiated by accessing the forms property, the 'empty_permitted' key is removed from the keyword arguments passed to _construct_form.\n\n3. **Changes in empty_form property (formsets.py start_line=258):**\n   The patch modifies the instantiation of a form inside the empty_form property to remove the 'empty_permitted' key from the keyword arguments.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly targeting the functions and methods integral to the formation of the formset's empty_form and its individual forms. The identified code spans are pertinent to where the problematic 'empty_permitted' would be applied.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is careful to remove 'empty_permitted' from form_kwargs at places directly related to form creation (both in the general instantiation of forms within the form property and specifically within the empty_form property). There are no visible new issues introduced, and it does not contradict identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately filters out the 'empty_permitted' key in relevant locations where form_kwargs affects form instantiation.
