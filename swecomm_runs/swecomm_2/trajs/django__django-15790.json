This adjustment is intended to handle cases where modules under the same name with different paths do not conflict.\n  </patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location Analysis\n4. **Function Correctness**:\n   \n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function, which is the correct location for handling logic to detect duplicate template tags. This function is directly involved in examining and collating template tag library names from Django settings.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Analysis\n5. **Introduction of New Issues**:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modification introduced ensures that the code handles unique keys without conflicts. There is no direct contradiction with the originally provided code spans. However, while the handling of the dictionary ensures differentiation between identical module names from different paths, careful testing is needed to confirm no unintended side-effects arise from composite keys.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fixing Effectiveness\n6. **Fix Confirmation**:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adequately targets the heart of the duplication issue by distinguishing unique libraries with composite keys of `(module_name, module_path)`, thereby fixing the bug mentioned in the report. However, given frequent LLM mistakes:\n- Verification ensures no scanning side effects on established Django processes do occur.\n- Ensures the remainder of functionations using this segment work unchanged are appropriately formed.\n\nSo far, `here` fall within expectation requirements, meticulously covering specific component aspects improving end templated comparisons reliability fixes, satisfying required issues rightly outlined in_section.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Scoring\n\n<score>8</score>"

Instead of storing `libraries[module_name]`, it uses a tuple\u00a0`(module_name, module_path)` as a key to avoid overriding and needless duplicate checks. This should handle the scenario of custom libraries colliding unintentionally.\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - Hunk Modified: In the function `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`, it changes to use a tuple of `module_name` and `module_path` as dictionary keys to prevent conflicts when differentiating between the same tag's different sources.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct Function Check:** \n   - The issue directly mentions the function `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`, and this is the function modified by the patch.\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues:**\n   - There are no apparent contradictions introduced by the change itself. However, there might be side-effects if anywhere in the rest of the code expects `libraries` to use singleton keys and would need to handle the case of accessing libraries differently.\n   - Checking contexts how tuple mapping affects existing flows is mandatory.\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   No new issues were introduced directly by the patch. However, existing code which accesses the `libraries` collection might have to be changed to accommodate the new composite key logic.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n   - Its engineering approach avoids overwriting already existing single paths under the generic library's word mapping.

Furthermore, the loop changes maintain the original intended logic making them backward-compatible with the initialization changes.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems logically sound and addresses the actual raised issue by altering dictionary storage structure to prevent false positives related to duplicate template tags. It uses composite keys to distinguish between identical libraries coming from different locations effectively.\n\nPotential common mistakes by LLMs include:\n- Misinterpreting the requirements in the issue description leading to an incorrect function being patched (which isn't the case here).\n- Introducing syntax or logical errors while making structural changes, none were observed in the patch.\n- Not considering edge cases for new data structures\u2014though recommended review code ensures duplicated paths of tags cannot cause E003 reported issues again.\n\nThe described modifications aim to prevent redundant error entries related to the most discussed problematic part and the core fix appears straight forward.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the function by using sets to handle the library paths, inherently avoiding duplicates. This change resolves the reported issue where multiple entries for the same library cause an error. One potential scenario to check is if different libraries with the same names but different paths may be silently ignored, though this seems within acceptable bounds for resolving the confusion of identical library names in the problem context. \n\nPotential mistakes LLMs can make:\n  - Incorrect function or logic: The patch instead uses set operations effectively for preventing duplicates.\n  - Missed edge cases: Here, libraries with different versions/paths will have unique strings avoided. One edge case not considered could be if order matters; however, that's not presented as part of the detailed required solution.\n\nGiven this analysis, the patch properly eliminates the error of including multiple duplicate template libraries by name.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The problem manifests as an error indicating that the same tag name is being registered for multiple modules.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe function `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` is incorrectly flagging a name collision when template tag libraries are added to `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']`. Users encounter an error that reports the same tag name being used for different modules.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Code Spans**\n\n- **Span IDs**: `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`, `get_package_libraries`, `get_template_tag_modules`\n\n- **Explanation**:\n  1. `<code_span file_path=\"django/core/checks/templates.py\" span_id=\"check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name\">`:\n     This function checks for template tag libraries with the same name by collecting them and examining if any name collisions exist. Relevant because it's directly responsible for the issue reported.\n\n  2. `<code_span file_path=\"django/template/backends/django.py\" span_id=\"get_package_libraries\">`:\n     This function recursively yields template tag libraries from a package. Relevant because it might contribute template tag paths to the `libraries` dictionary in the `issue` function.\n\n  3. `<code_span file_path=\"django/template/backends/django.py\" span_id=\"get_template_tag_modules\">`:\n     This function yields `(module_name, module_path)` pairs for installed template tag libraries. Relevant because it supplies the `(module_name, module_path)` pairs used by `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`: Directly responsible for gathering and validating template tag libraries.\n- Span `get_package_libraries`: Provides template tag libraries paths that contribute to the final list of libraries.\n- Span

The provided error: `my_tags is used for multiple template tag modules` encapsulates such a scenario.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Identified Code Spans and Their Relevance:\n\n<span_ids>\n- check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name\n- get_package_libraries \n- get_template_tag_modules\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name**: This function is where the check for duplicate template tag libraries happens and directly correlates to the issue at hand. Reviewing and updating this code span might resolve the problem.\n- **get_package_libraries**: Although not directly linked to the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function, this function deals with locating template tag libraries within package submodules, indirectly impacting template tag registration and potential duplicates.\n- **get_template_tag_modules**: This function specifically yields template tag module paths that register the libraries found across Django apps, contributing data that could collide with `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']`, causing the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Analysis:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Original code:\n    ```python\n    libraries = defaultdict(list)\n    ```\n    Updated code:\n    ```python\n    libraries = defaultdict(set)  # Use set to automatically handle duplicates\n    ```\n    Explanation: Changes the data structure from a list to a set to handle duplicates automatically by nature of set properties, avoiding duplicates effortlessly.\n\n2. Original code:\n    ```python\n    libraries[module_name].append(module_path)\n    ```\n    Updated code:\n    ```python\n    libraries[module_name].add(module_path)  # Use add instead of append to avoid duplicates\n    ```\n    Explanation: Transforms appending to a list into adding to a set, ensuring no duplicate entries for each module name.\n    \n3. Original code:\n    ```python\n    libraries[module_name].append(module_path)\n    ```\n    Updated code:\n    ```python\n    libraries[module_name].add(module_path)  # Use add instead of append to avoid duplicates\n    ```\n    Explanation: Similar conversion as previous to address duplicates in the template tag modules from settings composites or default calls.\n\n4. Original code:\n    ```python\n    \", \".join(repr(item) for item in items),\n    ```\n    Updated code:\n    ```python\n    \", \".join(repr(item) for item in sorted(items)),  # Sort items for consistent error messages\n    ```\n    Explanation: Sorts the path items for producing error messages, ensuring the message contents remain constant irrespective of dictionary ordering.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Function Evaluation:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` where the check for unique template tag libraries takes place.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is introducing no new issues relating to the identified code spans. It implements changes in a way that intersects neatly with the usage pattern of defaultdict, avoiding duplicate entries.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Analysis:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch uses Python's set data structure benefits correctly to prevent duplicates, automatically resolving the library name conflict issue. This involves properly addressing duplicate entry sources through custom libraries or default Django templates while ensuring ordered error messages, thus adhering to conventional debug practises, appropriate, efficient, and aligning well with common LLM recommendations.\nImprovements can be questioned in style, but for reviewing correctness in patch scope with common missteps considered, it stands rectified without additional complexities based oversight.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

It also sorts the items before generating error messages to maintain consistency in the error logs.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the relevant portion of the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function that directly addresses the collection and checking logic of template tag libraries.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo, the patch does not introduce new issues. The patch replaces the list with a set and uses appropriate methods of the set, avoiding the accumulation of duplicate entries and maintaining consistency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch appears capable of resolving the reported issue by addressing the honorary duplication problem of checking modules, conforming to the logic that avoids duplicates from being flagged redundantly. Traditional mistakes such as not properly transforming `append` into `add`, or failing to realign subsequently comparing logic, are not present here. The solution looks clean and adequately adjusts with a sorted, consistent error message.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
