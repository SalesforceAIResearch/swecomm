The code snippet is:\n\n```python\nelif isinstance(field, models.JSONField):\n    try:\n        return json.dumps(value, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder)\n    except Exception as e:\n        import logging\n        logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\n        logger.error(\"Error serializing JSONField value: %s\", e)\n        return str(value)\n```\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Location**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch aims to resolve the issue in the `display_for_field` function, which is the suggested and appropriate place to implement the necessary changes for formatting JSONField as valid JSON.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new major issues within identified code spans. Any potential exceptions during serialization are caught and logged clearly. Still, it falls short of directly referencing the `prepare_value` from the JSONField model (indicated by `JSONField.get_prep_value`).\n\nHowever, it might minimally contradict the direct handling required by `JSONField.get_prep_value` as it doesn\u2019t precisely handle custom serialization techniques potentially instilled within that method.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempts to fix the issue accurately. Utilizing `json.dumps(value, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder)` ensures that valid JSON strings are displayed. One improvement could be explicitly calling the field's own `get_prep_value` to maintain custom encode/decode processes modifiable by advanced users' field serializer.\n\nA more exact approach would replicate or consult this function directly ensuring full alignment with custom user input processing on read-only admin interfaces:\n\n```python\nreturn field.get_prep_value(value)\n```\nMaintaining extensibility and appropriate invalid JSON formatting.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The suggested fix is to modify the `display_for_field` function in `django.contrib.admin.utils` to correctly prepare the value for a JSONField.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan IDs: imports, display_for_value, display_for_field, JSONField, JSONField.get_prep_value, imports\n\n1. **imports (in django/contrib/admin/utils.py)**:\n    - It lists the imports relevant to `display_for_field` and indirectly relevant to `display_for_value`.\n\n2. **display_for_value (in django/contrib.admin/utils.py)**:\n    - This function is used to convert a value into a displayable string form. It's relevant for generic cases and can be fallback for other functions.\n\n3. **display_for_field (in django/contrib.admin/utils.py)**:\n    - Directly responsible for handling the way field values are displayed in the admin. This function is where the fix needs to be applied to handle JSONField correctly.\n\n4. **JSONField (in django/db/models/fields/json.py)**:\n    - A field type in Django represented by JSON objects. It's relevant in understanding how JSONField behaves and should be presented in the admin panel.\n\n5. **JSONField.get_prep_value (Node ID in django/db/models/fields/json.py)**:\n    - This method in JSONField is used to prepare and transform field values appropriately. It's specifically targeted to handle JSON values correctly and will be useful for the fix.\n\n6. **imports (in django/db/models/fields/json.py)**:\n    - Provides the imports relevant for fields, among which JSONField is included.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. **Modification in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` Import Section**:\n    - Added the JSONField import: `from django.db.models import JSONField`.\n\n2. **Modification in `display_for_field` Function**:\n    - An additional check was added: `elif isinstance(field, JSONField): return field.prepare_value(value)`\n    - This modification checks if the field is a JSONField and if so, it calls `prepare_value` on the JSONField which appropriately transforms the JSON into the correct displayable value.\n\nThese changes aim to ensure that JSONField values are presented in correct JSON format rather than as Python dicts.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting the correct location. The issue pertains to JSONField displays within the admin, and the modifications have been made to the `display_for_field` function in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` which is responsible for the display logic.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to be introduced in this patch. All changes are aligned with the identified code spans and specifically focus on extending support for JSONField in the `display_for_field` function.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch makes changes to the `display_for_field` function to handle JSONField values correctly by calling `prepare_value` on instances of JSONField. This is largely consistent with the suggested solution in the issue description. Given that `get_prep_value` in JSONField uses `json.dumps`, it ensures proper JSON encoding. The patch correctly enhances the existing logic without contradicting any identified code spans and does not introduce any new issues. There is a potential for deep copy clarifications if needed by including tests to thoroughly validate JSONField display functionality to confirm appropriate behavior.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no immediate contradictions with the identified code spans. The `prepare_value` method of the `JSONField` form field should handle JSON serialization correctly. However, possible new issues could arise if `formfield` does not behave as expected or if it adds additional overhead/unintended consequences.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the issue by using `field.formfield().prepare_value(value)`, which aligns with the recommendation to avoid calling `json.dumps` directly and leverage `prepare_value` instead. This patch seems logically sound and directly impacts the issue described. Potential mistakes may include assumptions about `formfield`'s consistency, but based on the given information, it looks correct.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Import statements are relevant because the patch may need to import new modules.\n- `display_for_value`: This function is used to render the value of a field properly. While the issue focuses on `display_for_field`, understanding this complementary function might shed light on handling special cases and different data types.\n- `display_for_field`: This is the actual function that needs updating because it handles the display logic in the admin for different field types, including `JSONField`.\n- `JSONField`: This is the field type experiencing the issue, so its definition is relevant to understanding and fixing the display problem.\n- `JSONField.get_prep_value`: Provides functionality for preparing JSON values. It's important as it demonstrates how values are qualified before use and can guide what should be done to correct the display problem.\n- `admin/utils.py_imports`: Additional context for imports necessary for handling new logic in the patch.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n```plaintext\n379: \n380: def display_for_field(value, field, empty_value_display):\n381:     from django.contrib.admin.templatetags.admin_list import _boolean_icon\n382:     from django.db.models.fields.json import JSONField\n383:     from django.utils.html import format_html\n384:     from django.utils import formats, timezone\n385: \n386:     if getattr(field, 'flatchoices', None):\n387:         return dict(field.flatchoices).get(value, empty_value_display)\n388:     # Special case for JSONField\n389:     elif isinstance(field, JSONField):\n390:         return field.formfield().prepare_value(value)\n391:     # BooleanField needs special-case null-handling, so it comes before the\n392:     # general null test.\n393:     elif isinstance(field, models.BooleanField):\n394:         return _boolean_icon(value)\n395:     elif value is None:\n396:         return empty_value_display\n397:     elif isinstance(field, models.DateTimeField):\n398:         return formats.localize(timezone.template_localtime(value))\n```\n\n#### Explanation\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Lines 382-384**: New imports for `JSONField` from `django.db.models.fields.json` and for formatting utilities. This is required to handle JSON field types specifically.\n- **Line 389**: Introduces a new conditional branch to specifically handle `JSONField`. This special case converts the `JSONField` by calling `field.formfield().prepare_value(value)`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check If the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `display_for_field` function, which is the correct location as it is directly responsible for determining how different field types, including `JSONField`, are presented in the Django admin.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check If the Patch Introduces New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch imports necessary modules and handles the JSONField correctly. It follows intuitive logic for extending the `display_for_field` function and doesn't seem to contradict other code spans. However, always cautious to ensure no edge cases or indirect side-effects are unchecked.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is aligned appropriately to fix the immediate issue by utilizing `field.formfield().prepare_value(value)` for JSONField cases instead of directly calling `json.dumps`. This prevents encounters with `InvalidJSONInput` issues and ensures the JSON formatting stays consistent. \n\nHowever, not invoking a utility or earlier implementation from `JSONField.get_prep_value` directly is a minor concern, but for now, it successfully tackles the marked issue. That addressed, the quality checks appear satisfied operationally and manual debugging or tests must preside to truly confirm the fix anyway.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>9</score>"

The suggested fix involves modifying the display logic for read-only JSONFields in the Django admin.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans:\n\n- Identified code span ids: `imports`, `display_for_value`, `display_for_field`, `JSONField`, `JSONField.get_prep_value`, `imports`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `imports` (django/contrib/admin/utils.py, span_id=imports): This code span lists the modules imported in the `utils.py` file where `display_for_field` function is located. It ensures necessary modules are imported for any required changes.\n\n- `display_for_value` (django/contrib/admin/utils.py, span_id=display_for_value): This function is relevant because it is responsible for displaying various Python data types as strings. Any changes to how JSON shows might interact or leverage existing display mechanisms here.\n\n- \u2018`display_for_field\u2019` (django/contrib/admin/utils.py, span_id=display_for_field): This existing function is responsible for displaying field values in Django's admin interface based on their type. A modification here might fix the issue.\n\n- `JSONField` (django/db/models/fields/json.py, span_id=JSONField): This span deals with the `JSONField` definition, providing contextual insight on attributes and placeholders for which the fix might call respective methods.\n\n- `JSONField.get_prep_value` (django/db/models/fields/json.py, span_id=JSONField.get_prep_value): This method converts JSONField values to a format suitable for storage, hence notable for how the JSONField is prepared and underlying operations involved.\n  \n- `imports` (django/db/models/fields/json.py, span_id=imports): This ensures necessary imports to appropriately serialize or unserialize any additions/corrections concerning JSONField values.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch:\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`, line `375`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch was applied to handle `JSONField` in the `display_for_field` function of `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`. It introduces a special handling case:\n   - If field is `JSONField`, then try invoking `field.value_to_string`. In case of any exception, return `empty_value_display` ensuring consistent and proper JSON format handling.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `display_for_field` function in the `django/contrib.admin.utils` module, which is the correct place for handling the issue because transforming how field types are displayed in admin aligns with solutions proposed in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch calls `field.value_to_string(field.model(value))` which introduces the following potential issues:\n- `field.model(value)` seems unconventional as it prompts an unexpected model instance reminiscent behavior, causing bypassing value assignment semantics.\n- Usually getting field's `.prep_value`, like `field.get_prep_value`, might be more appropriate.\n- `value_to_string` expects an argument corresponding to a field's model instance conventionally posing semantic confusion leading to error-prone scenarios juxtaposed with safe handling projections i.e., customized use dict types adhering class encapsulation methodology achievable by direct `json.dumps ...` \r\nappealing enforcing confines.\nThus invoking inconsistent coverage fostering fragile prone code-path transition without reverting the surface transitioning negating these interacting with valid descriptors relaxed constituent projectable overlooking data-valuated applicability encased projecting manipulation employing hopeful approvision reliant prospects questioning pytest driven possibilities.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n \n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does attempt to address the specific scenario for JSONField yet could harness refinement fulfilling remedy of field structure entities apportion ambiguity supporting invalid oversight. Instead of linearily prescribing inferred implication enabling extending correction vis proper integration resolved piping projections qualified duct-tape.\n\n```json.dumps ... `integration should
