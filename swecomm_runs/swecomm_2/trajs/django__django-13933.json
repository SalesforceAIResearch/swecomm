The `default_error_messages` dictionary in this class currently lacks detailed information about the invalid choice.\n\n2. `ModelChoiceField.to_python`:\n   - This method `to_python()` is where the `ValidationError` is raised when an invalid choice is encountered. It's essential for catching the exception and providing the new context, including the invalid value.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunk 1:\n   - Changes the error message in `default_error_messages` of `ModelChoiceField`. The `_('Select a valid choice. That choice is not one of the available choices.')` is modified to `_('Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the available choices.')`. This ensures that the invalid value will be included in the error message.\n\n2. Hunk 2:\n   - In the `to_python()` method of `ModelChoiceField`, the `ValidationError` now explicitly includes the invalid value by adding `params={'value': value}` when the exception is raised. This is what displays the invalid value in the error message.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct functions and attributes.

The changes include modifying error messages to show the invalid choice and updating the `ValidationError` to include the invalid value in its parameters. This is a common approach to showing more informative error messages and matches the behavior in other fields such as `ChoiceField`.

The request involves modifying the `default_error_messages` for the `invalid_choice` key to include the actual value of the invalid choice, similar to the behavior of the `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, which already includes the invalid value in its error message.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n- ModelChoiceField\n- ModelChoiceField.to_python\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **ModelChoiceField**: This code span is relevant because it defines the `ModelChoiceField` class, including the `default_error_messages`, which is being altered to include the invalid choice value in its error message.\n2. **ModelChoiceField.to_python**: This code span contains the `to_python` method, which is responsible for converting the input value into a value suitable for the queryset model. It raises a `ValidationError` with the message defined in `default_error_messages` when an invalid choice is encountered. Therefore, modifications in this function are directly related to resolving the issue of including the invalid choice value in the error message.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**:\n    - File: `b/django/forms/models.py`\n    - From line: 1183\n    - Modifications:\n        - The `default_error_messages` for `invalid_choice` in the `ModelChoiceField` class is updated to include the value of the invalid choice using the `%(value)s` placeholder.\n        - What it's doing: Changing the error message's format as required to display the specific invalid choice value when a `ValidationError` occurs.\n        \n2. **Hunk 2**:\n    - File: `b/django/forms/models.py`\n    - From line: 1280\n    - Modifications:\n      - In the `to_python` method, enhances the parameter object in the `ValidationError` by passing the invalid choice value with the key 'value'.\n      - What it's doing: This modification ensures that when a `ValidationError` is raised, it provides detailed information about the invalid choice by utilizing the new format specified in the `default_error_messages`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct locations. It directly addresses the two places identified in the issue:\n1. The `default_error_messages` dictionary of the `ModelChoiceField` class.\n2. The `to_python` method where the `ValidationError` is thrown.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues based on the identified code spans. It appears logically sound as it correctly specifies the invalid choice value to be included in both the error message template and the parameters of `ValidationError`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch efficiently addresses the specific issue mentioned. The modifications to the `default_error_messages` and the `to_python` method ensure the invalid choice value shows up in the `ValidationError` message. The patch does not fall into common LLM mistakes such as incorrectly referencing variables or altering unrelated code portions. The changes inline with existing similar behaviors (like in `ModelMultipleChoiceField`), ensuring adequate and expected consistency.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
