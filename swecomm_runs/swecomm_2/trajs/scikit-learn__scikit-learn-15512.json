The underlying behavior needs to be updated to match the documented behavior to ensure correct handling and notification of non-convergence.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the `AffinityPropagation` clustering algorithm does not adhere to the documented behavior when it fails to converge. It incorrectly returns cluster centers and labels rather than an empty array and `-1` for each training sample. This inconsistency makes it difficult for users to detect when the algorithm has not converged.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans.**\n   \n   **List of Span IDs:** \n   - `AffinityPropagation.fit`\n   - `AffinityPropagation.predict`\n   - `affinity_propagation`\n   - `AffinityPropagation`\n\n   **Explanation of Code Spans:** \n   \n   <code_span_exp>\n   - `AffinityPropagation.fit`: Defines the `fit` method which conducts the clustering using affinity propagation. The behavior regarding the convergence result is relevant as this method calls the `affinity_propagation` function and captures its output.\n\n   - `AffinityPropagation.predict`: Defines the `predict` method to predict the cluster each sample belongs to. Indicates actions based on whether the clusters were correctly identified.\n\n   - `affinity_propagation`: Central to applying the affinity propagation algorithm. Contains logic to detect non-convergence and generates the necessary outputs, making it relevant to the documented behavior of returning appropriate values when the algorithm fails to converge.\n\n   - `AffinityPropagation`: The broader class implementing the AffinityPropagation method extends several functionalities and might contain or affect the properties relevant to non-convergence notifications and related documentation/compliance.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch.**\n   \n   **List of Modified Hunks:**\n   - From line 195 to line 231 in the `affinity_propagation` method function.\n\n   **Explanation of Each Hunk:**\n   <patch_exp>\n   - The patched hunk (lines 195-231) adds explicit handling for the case where the affinity propagation algorithm does not converge:\n     1. Lines 200-202: Print a message if the verbose option is enabled.\n     2. Lines 203-211: Sends a warning indicating non-convergence has occurred. Then, ensures cluster centers and labels return appropriately: returns empty array for `cluster_centers_indices` and `[ -1]` for each sample as the label. Also considers the `return_n_iter` flag to return number of iterations if required.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.**\n   \n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct location. The non-convergence handling should be correctly implemented within the `affinity_propagation` method because this is where the results allocation happens based on convergence status. Ensuring the proper return values directly addresses the inconsistency problem.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues.

The method modification was directly aligned to what was needed and handled the conditions outlined by the documentation. There is no major common mistake visible such as mismanaging method correctness or misunderstanding criteria from the provided documented logic.

The code does not properly handle the situation when the algorithm does not converge. When convergence fails, the algorithm should return an empty array for cluster centers indices and -1 for each label, as per the documentation. However, the current implementation does not follow this behavior, causing incorrect cluster centers and labels to be returned.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- Identified span ids: \n  - `AffinityPropagation.fit`\n  - `affinity_propagation`\n  - `AffinityPropagation`\n  - `AffinityPropagation.predict`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- AffinityPropagation.fit: Relevant because it calls the `affinity_propagation` function and processes the returned cluster centers and labels.\n- affinity_propagation: This is the core function where the affinity propagation algorithm runs, when it does not converge, accurate values should be ensured here.\n- AffinityPropagation: This class, and the associated cluster centers and labels assignments, need to align with proper non-convergence handling.\n- AffinityPropagation.predict: Important because it uses the result from the fit function; predicting based on clusters needs to handle failed convergence properly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nModified hunks:\n\n1. Adding of resetting `I` and `K` when not converged in `affinity_propagation`.\n2. Ensuring cluster_centers_indices are set to an empty array when it did not converge.\n3. Changes in the `fit` method ensuring `self.cluster_centers_` to handle failed convergence.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. In `affinity_propagation`, lines 203-206:\n   - This part of the code resets `I` to an empty array and `K` to 0 if the algorithm does not converge. This ensures that no incorrect mid-results carry forward when convergence fails.\n2. In `affinity_propagation`, lines 229 and 236:\n   - Transforms `cluster_centers_indices` to an empty array and sets appropriate types to avoid unexpected outcomes on failures.\n3. In `AffinityPropagation` class/factory method values, changes at lines 393-399:\n   - Changes post the summary of `self.cluster_centers_` which properly address the precondition that if not self-precomputed and unsuccessful convergence avoids nullifying the associative operations which return extraneous collections.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies both the main implementation within `affinity_propagation` and anchors adjustments in relevant points of results processing within `AffinityPropagation`, marking tracked usages insider `AffinityPropagation instance fit and params reconciliations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces boundary-controlled resetting of cluster representation avoiding undefined states or collections that further align with documented results handling---raising no immediete issues contradicting identified code areas.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch does represent promising changes fixing the broken workflow by enforcing correct convergence states. These observations note that code adjustments reinforce appropriate warnings and returns needed exploitable for a conformity use circumstance!\nHowever, attention should reassure that `dtype=int init won't contrast worker logic extending where external accumulation assures against infitness needing vigilance or safer scope thereafter verifying this.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score Assignment\n\n<score>8</score>"

The documentation states that when the algorithm does not converge, it should return an empty array as `cluster_center_indices` and `-1` as `label` for each training sample. However, the provided example was showing non-empty clusters and label arrays despite non-convergence. This makes it challenging for the user to use the library effectively without additional hacks.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that AffinityPropagation clustering implementation does not return the expected empty list of cluster indices and an array of `-1`s for labels when the algorithm fails to converge.

According to the documentation, if the algorithm fails to converge, it should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices` and -1 for each label. However, the current implementation instead returns non-empty values even if it has not converged when reaching the max number of iterations. The user wants the code to return -1 values to signify non-convergence, to prevent them from having to check convergence manually.\n\nOutput:\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue describes that `AffinityPropagation` clustering fails to return empty cluster centers and -1s for labels when the algorithm does not converge, even though the documentation states that these values should be returned on non-convergence.

According to the documentation, an unconverged algorithm should return an empty array for `cluster_centers_indices_` and `-1` for each label. However, in the user-provided example, the algorithm outputs `[2]` as the cluster center and `[0, 0, 0]` as the labels.
