This is because the underlying link in the form assumes that UserAdmin is always accessed by its primary key (\"id\") and is hardcoded as such. By changing the help text to correctly reflect the dynamic field, the issue causing 404 errors when attempting to reset passwords can be fixed.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n- Span IDs: `UserAdmin.get_urls`, `UserAdmin`, `UserChangeForm`, `UserChangeForm.__init__`\n<code_span_exp>\n- `UserAdmin.get_urls` (span_id=UserAdmin.get_urls): Defines custom URL patterns for the UserAdmin view, notably for password change in users, which is relevant as correct URL configuration is needed.\n  \n- `UserAdmin` (span_id=UserAdmin): Declares the UserAdmin class configuration including its form classes and fields, directing the user alteration interface that depends on accurately linked forms.\n\n- `UserChangeForm` (span_id=UserChangeForm): The UserChangeForm class, especially its `password` field, whose help text includes the hyperlink expected to correctly link to the PasswordResetForm.

Previously, it assumed that the password reset link would use the relative path \"../password/\". The patch changes this to use \"../../{self.instance.pk}/password/\", which accommodates forms accessed through a non-primary key.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the modification in the `UserChangeForm.__init__` method is the correct location to address the issue because it is specifically where the password help text link is set. The incorrect assumption in the help text about always using the primary key is fixed by constructing the correct URL dynamically using `self.instance.pk`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a dependency on `self.instance.pk`, which assumes that `self.instance` will always have a `pk` attribute. If, for some reason, an instance without a `pk` is passed, this would lead to an AttributeError. However, Django model instances typically have a `pk`, so this is a typical assumption.\nNo direct contradictions with the provided code spans are apparent, as the URL structure change corresponds with the handling in `UserAdmin.get_urls`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does aim to fix the issue and implements the correct change. It replaces the hardcoded relative URL with one that dynamically constructs the password reset URL considering the specific instance\u2019s primary key.\nHowever, although it addresses the missed assumption issue, it potentially raises a concern for instances where a `pk` might not be immediately available or different. Considering best practices, it might be prudent to have better error handling to account for such cases, which isn\u2019t discussed here but generally assumed in these contexts.\n\nCommon LLM mistakes checklist:\n- **Overlooking edge cases**: Addressed possibly by assumptions but lacking exhaustive handling.\n- **Incorrect context/user understanding**: The patch has the appropriately correct context.\n- **Changes without understanding side-effects**: Additional runtime checking of the existence of pk would nail remaining precautions.\n\nThis patch fixes the problem identified effectively for typical use, though more robust safeguarding measures (API contract renegotiating primacy keys) might offer firmer future-proofing.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
