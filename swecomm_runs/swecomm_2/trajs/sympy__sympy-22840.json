It is directly involved since the issue concerns matrix symbols and their indexing.\n2. **span_id: tree_cse** - This function performs the lower-level CSE operations on expression trees, handling subexpressions. Any modifications to account for `MatrixSymbol` indexing likely need to begin here.\n3. **span_id: cse** - This is the primary user-facing function performing common subexpression eliminations. It calls `tree_cse` internally. The way it handles `MatrixSymbol`s and their indexing indirectly affects the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunks Modified:\n1.

If both conditions are satisfied, it treats this index access as an atomic expression and does not proceed with additional transformations. This prevents indexed `MatrixSymbol`s references from being decomposed during CSE, thus addressing the issue described.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch applies modifications to the `_find_repeated` function, which is relevant, since it directly affects how expressions and their subparts are processed within the CSE algorithm. The introduced check for `Indexed` and `MatrixSymbol` ensures that they are treated properly and not decomposed, which is aligned with the requirement stated in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any obvious new issues and does not contradict any identified spans. It only adds a check to ensure `MatrixSymbols` that are indexed remain atomic during CSE processing, which should not interfere negatively with other functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe fix adheres to the logic of handling the problem as explained in the issue description. Matrix indexing treated as atomic should prevent `MatrixSymbols` from being wrongly sub-evaluated or indexed, solving the stated problem in a manner consistent with normal usage of `MatrixSymbol` within sympy.\n\nIt avoids common LLM mistakes such as \n1. Over-simplifying the problem,\n2. Misapplying changes to irrelevant code sections,\n3. Misunderstanding the issue requirements,\n4. Introducing wrong or performance-impacting logic.\n\nGiven the straightforward nature of the task and its scoped application, the candidate patch correctly sidesteps these pitfalls and applies the necessary logical guard.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It details the algorithm's logic for finding and replacing subexpressions in this context and includes the relevant code for understanding how different expressions, like `MatrixSymbol`s, are treated.\n\n   - `cse`: This function is the higher-level wrapper for performing CSE, which eventually calls `tree_cse`. It's relevant because it shows how the functionality, including the handling of matrix expressions, is exposed to users. If there's an issue with `tree_cse`, it reflects here.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**:\n   \n   - **List of Modified Hunks**:\n     - Modification adding a condition to treat `MatrixSymbol` indexing as atomic.\n     \n   - **Explanation**:\n   <patch_exp>\n   - The patch adds a condition inside the `_find_repeated` function of `tree_cse`. Specifically:\n        \n     ```python\n     if isinstance(expr, Indexed) and isinstance(expr.base, MatrixSymbol):\n         return\n     ```\n     This modification ensures that, when processing expressions, if an indexed constituent is encountered where the base is a `MatrixSymbol`, it treats the indexed expression atomically, skipping its further expansion in CSE routines. Hence, any `MatrixSymbol` objects used via indexing won\u2019t be reduced as their parent matrices but rather conserved at element-level symbolics.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Fixing the Correct Function**:\n   \n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, since the modification is applied within the `_find_repeated()` method inside `tree_cse`, which is responsible for catching and eliminating subexpressions. Handling the leaf nodes correctly is crucial for this process, ensuring `Indexed` expressions involving `MatrixSymbol`s stay treated at appropriate levels without wrongly considering them complete `MatrixSymbol` replacements.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **New Issues Introduced**:\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   There does not seem to be new issues introduced in the logical flow pertaining to indexed matrix symbols. The context implies that the new check condition would correctly handle indexed cases that bypass full matrix reductions while preserving the intended tree synthesis.\n   </new_issues_exp> \n\n6. **Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue**:\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch specifically addresses the described problematic behavior by ensuring that expressions involving indexed `MatrixSymbol`s resources are not loosely treated as whole matrices in CSE, rectifying the over-simplification issues. No artificial complexities have been steered by usual LLM faults like redundant code inclusion or incidental loops calibration avoiding resource violations. Based on the provided algorithm improvements, this patch does appropriately fix the issue ensuring `MatrixSymbol` sub-element-based atomic reevaluation.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The change is appropriately placed in the section where `MatrixExpr` is handled specifically within the `_rebuild` function of `tree_cse`.\n</correct_location_exp> \n\n**Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any identified code spans.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not directly contradict any of the identified code spans. However, creating a generic `CSE_` named MatrixSymbol might impact identifier uniqueness. Besides, \"CSE_\" might be prone to clashing with other symbols. Using more intelligent or unique hashing for generating these names might be a solution here. Furthermore, the given approach does not add complete logic for avoiding clashes with existing symbols.\n</new_issues_exp> \n\n**Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch partially addresses the issue by tagging new common subexpression symbols with a prefix and numbering. However, it doesn't entirely solve the problem for all cases, since the logic for uniquely distinguishing symbols beyond simple name concatenation is incomplete. Ideally, the patch should ensure correct and unique indexing while correctly handling existing subexpressions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n**Score:**\n\n<score>5</score>"

These MatrixSymbol objects are central to the issue, as `cse` needs to treat them correctly during expression simplification.\n2. `tree_cse` - This function is responsible for performing the raw common subexpression elimination (CSE) on an expression tree, taking care of identifications necessary for performing substitutions. Its logic determines which subexpressions are redundant and thus needs to handle matrix symbols appropriately.\n3. `cse` - This is the top-level function that harnesses `tree_cse` to simplify a given expression. The simplification and substitution logic here is pivotal since it needs to know how and when to apply this optimization, avoiding the mishandling of entire MatrixSymbol objects.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunks:\n    - Code lines 660-681 in `cse_main.py`\n\n2. Patch Explanation:\n    - The hunk modifies the logic that rebuilds the tree to avoid substituting entire `MatrixSymbol` objects. The new condition checks if `orig_expr` is in `to_eliminate` and not a `MatrixSymbol`. This ensures that entire MatrixSymbols aren't replaced blindly, thus preventing unnecessary duplication of matrix entities.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the issue at the correct location. It directly intervenes in the logic to detect and replace common subexpressions within the expression tree, specifically extending a condition to handle matrix symbols properly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any new issues. The modification enhances a pre-existing condition without altering the original functionality for non-matrix symbols and doesn't contradict any of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch successfully addresses the issue by ensuring `MatrixSymbol` objects aren't fully substituted and duplicated during CSE optimization. The updated condition in the patch effectively prevents the mishandling noticed earlier, thereby fixing the bug.\n\nCommon LLM-generated errors evaluated:\n- Misunderstanding operand types (avoided by strict instance checking).\n- Exceptions due to unhandled cases (covered via the default existing flow in the method without alteration).\nGiven careful review, the patch does resolve the issue presented.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It directly handles matrix-related expressions, making it essential to understand how it should handle `MatrixSymbol` objects properly.\n\ncse:\nThis code span defines the `cse()` function which calls the `tree_cse()` method to perform common subexpression elimination on an expression or list of expressions. This method also deals with matrix expressions and their canonical reorderings, linking directly to the behavior in question.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n\n1. Lines 668-683\n- This hunk modifies how substitutions are handled inside `tree_cse()`.\n- The added condition `and not isinstance(orig_expr, MatrixSymbol)` prevents substitution for entire `MatrixSymbol` objects.\n- This inclusion prevents the entire matrix symbols from being included in `to_eliminate`, thus avoiding redundant indexing issues.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The change in `tree_cse()` function addresses the logic for eliminating expressions, which is consistent with the functionality discussed in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere don't seem to be any new issues introduced by the patch itself. The changes ensure that the entire `MatrixSymbol` is not substituted, which is crucial to the problem highlighted in the issue description. The expected behavior aligns correctly with the identified code spans, specifically the `MatrixSymbol` class and `cse()` mechanism.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to address the issue by preventing substitution for entire `MatrixSymbol` objects. This should ensure that partial indices and symbolic expressions involving matrix symbols are handled correctly without unnecessarily processing whole matrices. It avoids the common mistake of not considering the specific symbolic instances, such as partial indices in matrix structures. However, it would be prudent to ensure the edge cases and comprehensive tests are covered.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
