First curate a list of modified hunks. For each modified hunk, explain what it's doing. Output your explanation in the <patch_exp></patch_exp> field.\n\n<patch_explanations>\n1. Modified Hunk 1:\n  - **Before Patch:**\n```\n(0104) def parse_http_date(date):\n(0105)     \"\"\"\n(0106)     Parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1.\n  \n  [ ... existing code explaining the function ... ]\n```\n  - **After Patch:**\n```\n(0104) def parse_http_date(date):\n(0105)     \"\"\"\n(0106)     Parse a date format as specified by HTTP RFC7231 section 7.1.1.1.\n(0107) \n(0108)     if not date:\n(0109)         return None  # Handle empty string gracefully\n\n  [ ... remaining code ... ]\n```\n  - **Explanation:** Adds a guard clause to check if the input `date` is empty (or any other \"falsy\" value). If it is empty, the function returns None immediately, thus preventing exceptions that should not arise when dealing with valid input.\n</patch_explanations>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not. Output your explanation in the <correct_location_exp></correct_location_exp> field.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch applies the fix to the `parse_http_date` function in the correct part because `parse_http_date` looks at HTTP headers' date parts and an error arises when this date field is now unexpectedly empty. Additional functions like `get_conditional_response` call versions like `parse_http_date_safe` indirectly fix correct priority coordinates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans. Output your explanation in the <new_issues_exp></new_issues_exp> field.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch does not introduce known new issues or contradictions to `get_conditional_response`, `parse_http_date`, or `parse_http_date_safe` for present responsibilities: preventing expected operations of error attempting when`[HTTP_IF_UNMODIFIED_TITLE_7231/state] being equivalent no header date incapable initially`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6.

This function parses the date according to multiple formats and raises a `ValueError` if the date string is not in a valid format, which is tied to our issue when dealing with empty strings.\n\nThe third relevant code span is also in `django/utils/http.py` with the identifier `parse_http_date_safe`. This is a safe wrapper around `parse_http_date` intended to return `None` on invalid input rather than raising an exception. This function interacts with the modified and non-modified dates, impacting how an empty string for \"If-Modified-Since\" headers is processed.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n   - List of modified hunks:\n     - `django/utils/http.py` (lines 104\u2013118)\n     \n   - Explanation for each hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk inside the function `parse_http_date` in `django/utils/http.py` includes:\n   - An additional check (`if not date`) to determine if the `date` parameter is empty or falsy.\n   - Reporting `None` immediately if this condition is met to handle empty strings and avoid raising exceptions further down in the code that tries to parse the `date`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `parse_http_date` function, which is the correct location to handle invalid or empty input strings for HTTP date headers before the detailed parsing logic proceeds. Therefore, this is the appropriate function to apply such a fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. Since `parse_http_date_safe` already accounts for `None` results gracefully, returning `None` from `parse_http_date` only contextualizes a missing or invalid date, not causing new problems. The handling within the identified `get_conditional_response` is thus correctly aligned and does not contradict any other parts.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue of handling empty strings in the `parse_http_date` function by checking for an empty parameter and returning `None` before attempting any parsing. This returns control flow properly and prevents unintended exceptions, thereby fixing the discussed issue appropriately. Hence, this should resolve the encountered problem where exceptions were raised with empty \"If-Modified-Since\" headers.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n<score>10</score>"

Hunk 3 modifies `django/views/static.py` around line 131.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1 (django/utils/cache.py, line 178)**: Changes `if_modified_since` assignment to ensure that if `request.META.get(\"HTTP_IF_MODIFIED_SINCE\")` results in an empty value or fails to parse to a date, it defaults to `None`.\n- **Hunk 2 (django/utils/cache.py, line 265)**: Modifies the condition in the `_if_modified_since_passes` function to handle an additional case where the `if_modified_since` might be `None`.\n- **Hunk 3 (django/views/static.py, line 131)**: Adds a check explicitly for an empty `header` string and raises a `ValueError` if true.

It correctly handles the cases identified in `if_modified_since`, `_if_modified_since_passes`, and the parameter parsing to ensure no exceptions are raised due to empty strings.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch seems careful in its implementation and does not introduce new issues based on the identified code spans. It handles the empty string properly without contradicting other logic within the same function or related functions. The variable is clearly assigned as `None` if empty which safely bypasses subsequent date comparisons without failing.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the problem mentioned in the issue text by making sure empty string values for the `If-Modified-Since` header do not cause a date parsing exception. The changes ensure that such cases convert these date parsing attempts to `None`, safely avoided in later conditions. The approach adopted mitigates the problem without pitfalls seen in common mistakes like mishandling variable types or condition gaps.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

If the 'if_modified_since' is \"Falsey\" (being whitespace or empty string), this will eventually equate to `None`. \n  ```\n  `if_modified_since = if_modified_since and parse_http_date_safe(if_modified_since) or None`\n  ```\n  Ensures `None` if the date parsing fails or is empty.\n- In `_if_modified_since_passes` method of `django/utils/cache.py`, line 265 checks not only `last_modified` but also ensures non-emptiness for `if_modified_since`:\n  ```\n  return not last_modified or (if_modified_since && last_modified > if_modified_since)\n  ```\n- In `django/views/static.py`, an explicit check for empty string (`header == ''`) verifies and raises `ValueError`- preventing subsequent code sections to proceed which would throw unintended errors:\n  ```\n  if header == \"\":\n      raise ValueError\n  ```\n  Provides broader error handling extending `None` or \"invalid\" data analogous situations.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct Location**:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch targets the correct function areas. The original problem stems from mishandling \"If-Modified-Since.\" Pieces modified are mainly focused where header situational validations would escape exceptions improving function robustness boundaries.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introducing New Issues**:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch does not introduce new significant issues. New changes line-up with wrapping an added check against direct ETag assignments before parsing, preventing pass-through errors if a header turns valid. Ensuring 'None' state prickly returned imposes cleaning generates cleaner transition throughout subsequent HTTP logic therefore much of relevant function encapsulated adequately.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Patch Can Fix the Issue**:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patches correctly address empty headers by ensuing modifications occupying initial checked evaluations returning `None` when unfavorable provided it self-coincides with input processing favors ensuring safe fallback.

It avoids raising an exception for the empty string and returns `None` instead, aligning with the desired behavior.

Explanation of Candidate Patch\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Modified function: `parse_http_date` (104-123 in `django/utils/http.py`)\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The code introduces an early return of `None` when the input date string is empty. The updated docstring now includes a note indicating that an empty string will return `None.` Specifically:\n   - Adds: \n     ```python \n     if not date:\n         return None\n     ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Function Check\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `parse_http_date` function correctly because that is where the exception is being raised due to empty string inputs. Handling the empty string case at the function's entry point prevents the exception, effectively addressing the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Introduction of New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues concerning the identified code spans. It appropriately returns `None` on an empty string input, a behavior that is already handled by the calling code in `parse_http_date_safe`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Effectiveness of the Patch\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch avoids the common mistake of partial fixes by addressing the problem directly at the function responsible for parsing (`parse_http_date`). It prevents exceptions for empty string inputs, and it aligns with the current usage in `parse_http_date_safe`. No new problems are introduced, and all existing flows should remain unaffected.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Score\n<score>10</score>"

Check if the patch can fix the issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly adds a check for empty strings in both the `parse_http_date_safe` and `was_modified_since` functions. Adding these checks addresses the problem as described by ensuring that empty strings no longer proceed through date-parsing logic, which inadvertently resolves potential exceptions raised later.\n\nCommon mistakes:\n- **Incorrect condition checking**: The `if not date` and `if not header` effectively handle the specific need to manage empty strings without entering unnecessary parse logic, ensuring robustness.\n- **Incomplete logic adjustments**: All relevant affected pathways (i.e., `was_modified_since` and the utilities it relies upon) are patched simultaneously.\n\nThe patch appears not to fall into typical pitfalls like partial fixes or improper conditionals and conclusively resolves the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Empty string used to be ignored for If-Modified-Since header, but now raises an exception due to a recent change.\n</issue_description>\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue described entails that the application now raises an exception when it encounters an empty string for the \"If-Modified-Since\" header. Historically, an empty string was ignored for this particular header, but due to recent changes in the code, this situation now triggers an error, thus requiring a fix.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation\nNow, let's look at the relevant code spans provided.\n\n- Span ID: `get_conditional_response`\n- Span ID: `parse_http_date`\n- Span ID: `parse_http_date_safe`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **Span ID: get_conditional_response** - This function processes HTTP headers and includes the \"If-Modified-Since\" header. It will likely be affected by how empty strings are handled for this header.\n2. **Span ID: parse_http_date** - This function parses date strings according to the HTTP specification. If an empty string is considered an invalid date, it might raise the exception causing the issue.\n3. **Span ID: parse_http_date_safe** - This function also deals with parsing HTTP dates but is supposed to return `None` for invalid inputs, which could be leveraged to handle empty strings gracefully.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Explanation\nLet's break down the candidate patch in the modified hunks and understand each.\n\n#### Hunk 1 in `django/utils/http.py`\n**Modification:**\n<before_patch>\n<before_file=\"a/django/utils/http.py\" start_line=141>\n141:     except Exception as exc:\n142:         raise ValueError(\"%r is not a valid date\" % date) from exc\n144: \n145: def parse_http_date_safe(date):\n146:     \"\"\"\n147:     Same as parse_http_date, but return None if the input is invalid.\n148:     \"\"\"\n149:     try:\n150:         return parse_http_date(date)\n151:     except Exception:\n152:         pass\n156: \n</before_patch>\n<after_patch>\n<after_file=\"b/django/utils/http.py start_line=141\">>\n141:     except Exception as exc:\n142:         raise ValueError(\"%r is not a valid date\" % date) from exc\n144: \n145: def parse_http_date_safe(date):\n146:     \"\"\"\n147:     Same as parse_http_date, but return None if the input is invalid.\n148:     \"\"\"\n149:     if not date:  # Check if the date string is empty\n150:         return None\n151:     try:\n152:         return parse_http_date(date)\n153:     except Exception:\n154:         pass\n156: \n</after_patch>\n\n**Explanation:** This hunk updates the `parse_http_date_safe` function to directly return `None` for empty date strings, thus avoiding the parsing altogether for such cases.\n\n#### Hunk 2 in `django/views/static.py`\n**Modification:**\n<before_patch>\n<before_file=\"a/django/views/static.py\" start_line=111>\n114: def was_modified_since(header=None, mtime=0, size=0):\n115:     \"\"\"\n116:     Was something modified since the user last downloaded it?\n118:     header\n119:       This is the value of the If-Modified-Since header.

If this is None or empty,\n120:       I'll just return True.\n128:     if not header:\n129:         return True\n</after_patch>\n\n**Explanation:** This hunk modifies the `was_modified_since` function to check for empty headers, treating them similarly to `None` and returning `True` to avoid processing them further.\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk 1: Adds a check in `parse_http_date_safe` function to return `None` if the date string is empty, preventing exceptions due to empty strings.\nHunk 2: Updates the `was_modified_since` function to treat empty headers as `None`, returning `True` to signify no modification rather than processing empty date strings.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch touches the correct locations. It addresses both the `was_modified_since` function (which handles the \"If-Modified-Since\" header) and modifies the `parse_http_date_safe` function (utilized in date parsing).\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce new issues. It properly checks for empty strings in relevant areas without conflicting with the code spans provided.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Fix Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch looks poised to fix the issue correctly. Given that common LLM errors include dealing with string conditions and exception handling, this patch seems well-protected against them by relying on direct condition checks (`if not header` and `if not date` checks).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Modifying this function is central to addressing the issue because it directly interacts with `parse_http_date` where empty strings might cause exceptions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. \nCurate a list of modified hunks:\n- Changes in `parse_http_date_safe` between lines 145-155\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk in the `parse_http_date_safe` function checks if the input `date` is empty using an `if not date:` condition. If the date is empty, it returns `None` immediately. This early return guards against the exception that an invalid date format might cause later in the code. Additionally, the `except` block also ensures that raised exceptions due to invalid date formatting return `None`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. <correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `parse_http_date_safe`. Since this function processes potentially invalid dates including empty strings, adding handling for empty strings here is appropriate.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. <new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any contradictions with the identified code spans. Further, it seems to carefully add an edge case without disrupting the existing logic that raises exceptions for truly malformed dates.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. <fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to correctly address the issue by accounting for empty strings and ensures they do not lead to exceptions. It specifically prevents the function from parsing when the input date string is empty, fixing the original issue described. The modification is targeted and doesn't fall into common pitfalls such as complicating logic unnecessarily or misinterpreting the function's responsibilities.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It calls the `parse_http_date_safe` function to get the date from the `If-Modified-Since` header in the request, so any modification to `parse_http_date_safe` affects this function.\n- **parse_http_date**: This function parses a date according to HTTP specification and is used by `parse_http_date_safe`.\n- **parse_http_date_safe**: This function calls `parse_http_date`, returning `None` if the input is invalid. Fixing the empty string handling here will directly prevent the empty string `If-Modified-Since` from raising an exception.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Change in `parse_http_date_safe` function in `django/utils/http.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `parse_http_date_safe` function to include a check for empty strings at the start by adding:\n```python\nif not date:  # Handle empty string case\n    return None\n```\nThis ensures that empty strings do not proceed to raise exceptions, but directly return `None`, following the function's documentation to return `None` if input is invalid.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:** \n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `parse_http_date_safe`, where the handling for invalid input, such as empty strings, should occur.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues; it aligns with the documented behavior to return `None` for invalid inputs.
