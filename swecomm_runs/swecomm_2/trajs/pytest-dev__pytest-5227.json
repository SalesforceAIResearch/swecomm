It only enhances the logging format string by adding the module name which complements the existing logging fields such as filename and line number, useful for the users.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly applies the necessary change to the logging format by including the `name` formatter, achieving the suggested improvement for more informative logging. The refactoring aligns with the requested change, follows the commonly accepted way to customize logging formats in Python, and does not fall into usual common mistakes typically made by LLMs such as misplacing the change or incorrect usage of logging formatters. \n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:**\n\n<score>10</score>"

The suggested new format is as follows:\n\n`%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s`\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about improving the logging format to include the module name in addition to the filename, line number, and log level.

Understand the Identified Code Spans\nLet's first list the span IDs and then describe their relevance:\n\n- Span IDs: `LoggingPlugin`, `pytest_addoption`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `LoggingPlugin`: This span shows the definition of the `LoggingPlugin` class, which is responsible for capturing log messages.

Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\nThe patch directly updates the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in the relevant part of the codebase.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch updates the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in the appropriate file (`src/_pytest/logging.py`).

Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues\nNone of the identified code spans contradict what the patch aims to achieve. It is primarily updating a format string, which is universally applicable, hence not clashing with any context from `LoggingPlugin` or `pytest_addoption`.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues.

Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\nThe patch correctly forms a new logging format string that meets the requirements stated in the issue. No common mistakes such as partial updates, incorrect field references, or syntax errors are present.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue effectively by updating the logging format to include the module name as required. It does not fall into any common LLM-generated mistakes and successfully achieves the described enhancement.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7.

Adjusted the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` constant in `src/_pytest/logging.py` to include the `name` field between `levelname` and `filename`.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` constant in the `src/_pytest/logging.py` file has been updated from `%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s` to `%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s`. This new format will include the logging level, module name, base filename, line number, and message.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the correct function/location through updating the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` constant, which will propagate the new format wherever this default is employed.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and does not contradict existing functionality in the relevant code spans (`LoggingPlugin`, `pytest_addoption`), as updating the default log format is concordant with the expectations laid out in these spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully fixes the issue by updating the default logging format to include the module name (`name`). This enhancement provides better log context as requested in the issue. The approach is appropriate, correctly modifies the required part, and aligns with the proposed improved format, addressing the logging needs specified in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
