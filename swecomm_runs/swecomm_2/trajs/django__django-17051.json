Checks seem solid with intersection targeting the postgresql transactional requirements supporting `bulk insert + returning` infrastructure compatibly.

It's crucial because it influences how the conflict-handling SQL statements are formed.\n- **QuerySet.bulk_create**: This method insert objects in bulk and is where enhancements for returning IDs on conflict updates need to be applied.\n- **QuerySet._batched_insert**: This helper method is responsible for handling bulk inserts one batch at a time, playing a significant role in the `bulk_create` process.\n- **QuerySet._insert**: This function is another helper for insert queries and is invoked by `_batched_insert`. It needs to be adapted to accept parameters for conflict handling.\n- **SQLInsertCompiler.as_sql**: Generates SQL statements for insert operations. It must be able to create the correct SQL with conflict-handling clauses.\n- **SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql**: Executes the SQL insert operations and should handle returning IDs when conflicts are updated.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql: This function generates SQL code for different conflict resolution scenarios (`IGNORE` or `UPDATE`).

Check Correct Location:\n\nThe changes are within the `bulk_create`, `_batched_insert`, and involved helper functions, directly aligning with the code spans and the problem statement.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the correct locations within the `bulk_create` and related helper methods to return IDs when handling conflict updates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### 5. Check for New Issues:\n\nThe patch introduces no immediate contradictions or new issues. It extends existing checks without altering the documented expectations significantly. The logic remains clear, handling whether IDs should be fetched or not based on conflict rules.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues compatible with the constraints set by the existing logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue:\n\nThe patch convincingly fixes the issue as it effectively updates conditions ensuring IDs can be returned where conflict updates (`update_conflicts=True`) occur.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch accurately resolves the issue, appropriately modifying the `bulk_create` function to return IDs following conflict updates. It avoids common mistakes by careful condition updates.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n#### 7. Scoring:\n\n<score>9</score>"

Currently, when conflicts are handled using the `update_conflicts` flag, the primary keys (IDs) for the affected rows are not returned in the resulting queryset. This behavior is acceptable for `ignore_conflicts` due to PostgreSQL's limitations, but with `update_conflicts`, the expectation is to receive the IDs for updated rows. The patch aims to fix this by appending the `RETURNING id` clause to the query when `update_conflicts` is used.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n  \n**List of span ids:**\n- DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql\n- QuerySet.bulk_create\n- QuerySet._batched_insert\n- QuerySet._insert\n- SQLInsertCompiler.as_sql\n- SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql**:\n  Defines and manages the SQL strings for different conflict resolution strategies, relevant for modifying the SQL clause to include `RETURNING id` for updating conflicts.\n\n- **QuerySet.bulk_create**:\n  Handles the creation of multiple database objects in one operation, particularly the main method being discussed for bulk insert operations with conflict handling.\n\n- **QuerySet._batched_insert**:\n  A helper function for performing batch inserts within `bulk_create`, involved in organizing bulk insert operations, and it's closely related to returning information after insertions.\n\n- **QuerySet._insert**:\n  Lower-level function for individual insertion tasks that `bulk_create` relies on, having significant handling in on_conflict scenarios to execute SQL correctly.\n\n- **SQLInsertCompiler.as_sql**:\n  Compiles the SQL query for an insert operation, determining how the SQL string incorporates conflict handling (e.g., `RETURNING id` clause).\n\n- **SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql**:\n  Executes the compiled SQL query and fetches returned rows or columns if required, vital for ensuring that operations with returning fields fetch the correct data.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n**Modified hunks:**\n\n- **Hunk 1 (django/db/models/query.py)**:\n    ```diff\n    (0815) and on_conflict is None\n    + and (on_conflict is None or on_conflict == OnConflict.UPDATE)\n    ```\n\n- **Hunk 2 (django/db/models/query.py)**\n    ```diff\n    (1840) if bulk_return and on_conflict is None:\n    + if bulk_return and (on_conflict == None or on_conflict == OnConflict.UPDATE):\n    ```\n\n**Patch Explanations:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1**:\n  Changes the condition to ensure rows are returned both when `on_conflict` is `None` (original behavior) and when `on_conflict` is `OnConflict.UPDATE`.\n\n- **Hunk 2**:\n  Conditions in batched insert operations to ensure returning fields are considered under `update_conflicts`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct location or not**\n  \n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch appropriately modifies `QuerySet.bulk_create` and related `_batched_insert` methods.

List of span IDs: \n   - DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql\n   - QuerySet.bulk_create\n   - QuerySet._batched_insert\n   - QuerySet._insert\n   - SQLInsertCompiler.as_sql\n   - SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql\n  \n<code_span_exp>\n1. **DatabaseOperations.on_conflict_suffix_sql**: This method in PostgreSQL operations appends SQL syntax required for handling conflict behaviors like update or ignore, relevant because the proposed change involves conflicts in bulk inserts.\n2. **QuerySet.bulk_create**: This is the main method under scrutiny for handling bulk inserts and conflicts; altering it will subsequently impact the return value for `update_conflicts`.\n3. **QuerySet._batched_insert**: A helper method for `bulk_create` handling insertions in batches, impactful since changes here will harvest the primary keys post `update_conflicts`.\n4. **QuerySet._insert**: Procedures the SQL insert query itself, thus necessary for applying conflict handling clauses accurately.\n5. **SQLInsertCompiler.as_sql**: Generates the appropriate SQL command to handle bulk inserts and conflicts, hence crucial for ensuring IDs are returned post-conflict updates.\n6. **SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql**: Executes the SQL commands constructed, impacting the reading back of returned columns post-inserts.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### Lee Selective list of modified hunks and their changes\n\n1. **Hunk 1**\n   - File: `django/db/models/query.py`\n   - Original: \n      ```python \n      (0739)         autoincrement field (except if features.can_return_rows_from_bulk_insert=True).\n      ``` \n   - Modified:\n      ```python \n      (0739)         autoincrement field (except if features.can_return_rows_from_bulk_insert=True or update_conflicts=True).\n      ```\n   \n2. **Hunk 2**\n   - File: `django/db/models/query.py`\n   - Original: \n      ```python \n      (0815)                     and on_conflict is None\n      ``` \n   - Modified:\n      ```python \n      (0815)                     and (on_conflict is None or update_conflicts)\n      ```\n\n#### Explanation of Each Hunk\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**: Modifies the docstring to account for the new behavior - primary keys will be set if `update_conflicts` is True.\n2. **Hunk 2**: Changes the condition under which `returned_columns` is populated to include scenarios where `update_conflicts` is enabled, enabling bulk inserts to fetch the primary keys of updated rows.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Verification\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies relevant places:\n- The docstring explaining the context in `bulk_create`.\n- The conditions that organize returned object primary keys depending on conflict options.\n\nThus the patch is likely adjusting the proper functions for encompassing the return of primary keys on updates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: New Issue Verification\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere don't appear to be any new blatant issues introduced as it doesn\u2019t seem to generate errors conflicting with the provided spans. Ensuring the logging harmonizes aggregates returned primary keys on bulk upsert situations as intended. Given the changes are minor and conditionally secure, it shouldn\u2019t contradict or fails visibly within the controls provided.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Verify if Patch Fixes the Issue \n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch moves the acceptable situation given (logical condition additions) to support the return of IDs when `update_conflicts` is engaged, addressing articulated problems participating proficiency in upsert feature of `bulk_create`. No superficial reflection shows getting hived established ID throws in the output set sustainably augment scripted intentions nor breaking design compromises expected, yielding diversified bulk upsert scenarios get indexed to `returning.entity_id`.\n\nIssues possible corrections continuity rules out.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

The change now considers `on_conflict` to determine bulk_return values, meaning it will activate `bulk_return` even if the backend does not support handling large bulk inserts (which may not necessarily have been a feature flag before). This could lead to an unexpected behavior on certain databases which might affect the safe defaults of this method.\nAdditionally, enhancing or forcing the return of IDs hinges on whether `self.model._meta.db_returning_fields` is always correctly set up, which is influenced by more factors not covered by this small context.\nTherefore, testing, across all relevant DB engines supported by the Django core, is crucial to consider the complete always-success scenario.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the primary issue by ensuring that records\u2019 IDs are returned even when using the update conflicts feature in `bulk_create`. However, this makes an assumption regarding all back-end features in mono-scenario since every slight change can effectively affect the return consolidated feature across native data handling flows only preventing valid reads under different potential states. Correct layering validation impacts and real assorted users might break through if significantly does seem patched resolution long term stability.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
