This worked correctly in Pylint 1.7 with Python 3.6, but fails in the updated environment.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans.\n\n- Span IDs: Message, TextReporter.on_set_current_module, TextReporter\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Message`: This code span consists of the `Message` class which holds all possible parameters for a message issued by Pylint. These parameters are used in message templates, making this class relevant to template processing.\n- `TextReporter.on_set_current_module`: This method in the TextReporter class seems responsible for parsing a template string, warning about unrecognized arguments in the template, and fixing the template accordingly to align with `MESSAGE_FIELDS`.\n- `TextReporter`: This code span introduces the `TextReporter` class, a reporter used for outputting messages and layouts in plain text format. Since message formatting is related to this class, understanding it is important for resolving issues with message templates.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch.\n\n- Modified Honks:\n  - Line changes from `re.sub(r\"\\{\" + argument[0] + r\"(:.*?)?\\}\", \"\", template)` to `re.sub(r\"\\{\" + re.escape(arg_name) + r\"(:.*?)?\\}\", \"\", template)`\n  - New strip operation added for better handling of argument names in template\n  - `arg_name = argument[0].strip()`\n\n<patch_exp>\n The candidate patch modifies the template parsing mechanism to strip any leading or trailing whitespace from arguments discovered in the `--msg-template`. It also updates the regular expression to escape these argument names properly, avoiding any unexpected issues arising from special characters.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The `on_set_current_module` method of the `TextReporter` class is responsible for handling and parsing the message template (`--msg-template`), which is directly related to the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces no obvious new issues. Explicitly stripping argument names and escaping them in the regular expressions improve robustness and should handle template customization more gracefully.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the LLM's key mistake of not handling whitespaces or special characters correctly in interpreted arguments. By escaping special characters and stripping unnecessary whitespaces, it reinstates the functionality witnessed in older Pylint versions, allowing custom messages' templates to behave as expected and preventing invalid warnings.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>\n"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that using custom braces with double curly braces (`{{ }}`) in the message template for `pylint` no longer works as expected. While the provided template worked correctly in earlier versions of `pylint` (1.7 with Python 3.6), producing formatted output, it fails in newer versions (2.12.2 with Python 3.9), resulting in warnings and malformed output. The user expects the dictionary structure within the template to print correctly with the specified keys.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Message\n2. TextReporter.on_set_current_module\n3. TextReporter\n\n**Message Code Span:**\nThis code span defines the `Message` class, which holds various attributes used in the message reporting system. The attributes include `msg_id`, `category`, `line`, etc., and these attributes are the ones being formatted in the message template.\n\n**TextReporter.on_set_current_module Code Span:**\nThis code span contains the method `on_set_current_module` of the `TextReporter` class. The method checks for unrecognized arguments in the template string through regex matching and issues warnings accordingly. This is directly related because the problem described involves the validation of template string arguments, which currently does not support user-defined brace-enclosed content.\n  \n**TextReporter Code Span:**\nThis code span depicts the `TextReporter` class definition, the reporter responsible for outputting plain text messages. Alterations dealing with message templates and their validations would likely affect this class.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n**Modified Hunks:**\n\n1. **Modification in TextReporter.on_set_current_module Method:**\n   - Regex updated to allow characters other than standard message fields.\n   - New code logic setup to only issue warnings for truly unrecognized arguments but not remove them from the template.\n   - Complex templates, including those with nested braces, will now remain unchanged.\n\n2. **write_message Method Update:**\n   - Modified to use the unaltered, fixed template for formatting, so some unrecognized arguments can be kept for custom formatting.\n\nExplanation Length:\n   \nThe modified `TextReporter.on_set_current_module` method scans the template for arguments using updated regex which accommodates for nested curlies and matches non-standard specifiers.\nAt line 179, unrecognized arguments aim not to be removed unlike before, only a warning issuance takes place.\n\nIn the `write_message` method, maintaining the altered method logic forewarns yet processes without disambiguation.

TextReporter.on_set_current_module: Lines 170-186 changed.\n\n#### Explanation of Each Hunk:\n<patch_exp>\n1. The candidate patch modifies `TextReporter.on_set_current_module`:\n   - It changes the regex in line 178 to use a negative lookbehind `(?<!\\{)` and negative lookahead `(?!\\})` to exclude escaped curly braces from being matched. This targets the issue by tweaking how template parameters inside double curly braces are recognized.\n   - The patch ensures the related warnings and replacements operate as expected.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Check\nThe modification appears in `TextReporter.on_set_current_module` method, where template strings are processed, which seems appropriate given how the issue describes this processing breaking for certain string patterns.\n\n### Output:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch appears to be applied to the correct location within the `TextReporter.on_set_current_module` method, where the `msg-template` is handled and necessary checks occur.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Any New Issues Check\nThe patch modifies a regex pattern for template matching and associated replacements. However, it introduces an extra redundant line, duplicated assignment, `self._fixed_template = template`, at line 188, but does not fundamentally alter behavior beyond intended purpose.\n\n### Output:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a new issue with a redundant assignment (`self._fixed_template = template`). This redundancy does not contradict existing spans but should be corrected.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Can the Patch Fix the Issue Check\nThe regex tweak to disregard escaped curly braces addresses the precise nature of the reported error. This approach aligns matching templates up with custom braces properly, addressing core mechanism interference.\n\n### Output:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately adjusts the regex to handle custom braces in templates, aimed correctly at resolving the issue. Additionally, the redundancy in assignments should be pruned out.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Scoring\nGiven the redundancy, a minor procedural error, subtracting some quality points is fair, but fundamentally sees correct and contextually fitting applied logic more substantial over specifics.\n\n### Output:\n<score>8</score>"

Understand the issue\n\nThe issue describes a regression problem where using a custom message template with custom braces in Pylint appears to work on older versions (Pylint 1.7 with Python 3.6), but produces warnings and incorrect output in newer versions (Python 3.9 with Pylint 2.12.2).

Understand the identified code spans\n\nList of span IDs:\n- Message\n- TextReporter.on_set_current_module\n- TextReporter\n\nExplanation per code span:\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe relevant code spans address the incompatibility issue with message templates:\n1. **Message**: Contains the potential fields for a message, which are crucial for template formatting (`category` being crucial in the provided test template).\n2. **TextReporter.on_set_current_module**: Contains logic to check and set the message format templates and handles cases where the custom template achievements are checked using regular expressions.

Understand the candidate patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification from line 178 to line 187 in `pylint/reporters/text.py`\n\nExplanation per hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The modification in text.py:\n    - The updated regular expression in line 178 (`arguments = re.findall(r\"(?<!\\{)\\{([^{}]+?)(:.+?)?\\}(?!\\})\", template)`) ensures that escaped curly braces are ignored. This change intends to correctly parse template arguments that are not part of the literals in provided custom templates.\n    - The method essentially filters the `arguments` list to check for message fields and triggers a warning if something is unrecognized, purifying it accordingly (`template = re.sub(r\"\\{\" + re.escape(argument[0]) + r\"(:.+?)?\\}\", \"\", template)`).\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is implementing changes in the right location. The function `on_set_current_module` in `TextReporter` class handles the logic to parse and validate message formatting templates by extracting arguments via regular expressions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. The enhanced regular expression increases robustness to manage custom braces effectively by adding lookahead and lookbehind checks. It maintains proper escaping using `re.escape(argument[0])` when substituting.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch's revised regular expression is more precise than the previous one. The addition of lookahead `(?<!\\{)` and lookbehind `(?=\\})` assertions ensures it selectively matches unescaped braces only. This mitigates the template parsing issue raised in custom braces, potentially resolving the flagged warnings. Common issues such as mishandling template arguments or regular expression errors are addressed effectively in this fix.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7.

If there's a KeyWarning during the formatting, it issues a warning to prompt the user to check the template.\n\n2. **Hunk modifying message handling region**: This code adjusts the checking logic to include double brace patterns alongside existing single braces. A warning is issued if neither pattern is found, implying unrecognized custom template braces.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe modifications are within appropriate and relevant methods of the `TextReporter` class and its methods where messages are formatted and handled, considering the identified spans and the described issue. Therefore, the patch is addressing the correct location for handling the issue with custom brace templates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch attempts to replace double braces with single braces universally, which might not be the intended user behavior in all cases, introducing potential unexpected side-effects. Additionally, it does not fully integrate the custom braces handling seamlessly with actual existing format string mechanisms.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch tries to resolve the issues with proper intention, it may fall short by replacing double braces universally and may introduce formatting errors by unconditionally replacing guarded double braces with single braces before template formatting. Common issues LLMs have include incorrect handling of formatting and potentially oversimplifying template issues without considering deeper integration.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>3</score>"
