According to the Django documentation, if a specific sublanguage (e.g., `de-at` for Austrian German) isn't available, Django should fallback to the base language (e.g., `de` for German). However, in the reported issue, setting `LANGUAGE_CODE` to a sublanguage that isn't defined, e.g., `de-at`, causes an error `translation.E004`. This contradicts the documented behavior where it should fallback to the base language if available.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans. First provide a list of the span ids. Then explain how each of the identified code spans are relevant to the issue. Output your explanation in <code_span_exp></code_span_exp> tags.**\n\n- Span IDs: `check_language_settings_consistent`\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan ID: `check_language_settings_consistent`\n\nThis code span includes the definition of the function `check_language_settings_consistent`, which is responsible for verifying whether the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting is valid and in sync with the `LANGUAGES` setting. It plays a key role in raising the `translation.E004` error if the `LANGUAGE_CODE` is not found in the available languages. This is the exact function that is involved in the issue of incorrectly raising the error when a valid base language is available.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch. First curate a list of modified hunks. For each modified hunk, explain what it's doing. Output your explanation in the <patch_exp></patch_exp> field.**\n\n- Modified Hunk: `django/core/checks/translation.py: 58-65`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The variable `language_code` is initialized with the value `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`.\n2. The code checks if `language_code` is not in `available_tags`. If it's not, it extracts the base language (e.g., \"de\" from \"de-at\").\n3. Then, it checks if this base language is present in `available_tags`. If neither the `language_code` nor its base language is found in `available_tags`, it raises `E004`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not. Output your explanation in the <correct_location_exp></correct_location_exp> field.**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly placed within the `check_language_settings_consistent` function. This is indeed the function responsible for checking the consistency of the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting and raising the `translation.E004` error, thereby directly addressing the reported issue regarding sublanguages and base languages.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans. Output your explanation in the <new_issues_exp></new_issues_exp> field.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It handles the specific case of sublanguages by checking if the sublanguage or its corresponding base language is in `available_tags` before raising `E004`. This logic aligns with the goal of falling back to the base language when the sublanguage is not available, as specified in the reported issue. There are no identified code spans that contradict with this patch.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch agains the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes. Output your explanation in the <fix_issue_exp></fix_issue_exp> field.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue as described. It correctly eliminates the throwing of `E004` when a base language is available by adding a conditional that checks for the base language. It eliminates the need to explicitly provide the sublangauge but falls back to the base language if it's available.\n\nCommon potential issues could be:\n- Incorrect logical conditions.\n- Ignoring edge cases.\n- Overwriting relevant variables leading to other potential errors.\nHowever, the current patch considers the `language_code` and its `base_language` sequentially, preventing such logical inconsistencies. The patch fits well within domain requirements without altering unintended portions of the functionality, adhering to the illustrated requirements within the issue description.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Finally, give me your score.

Understand the issue:\n\nThe issue reported is that the Django framework should not raise an error `translation.E004` when a sublanguage variant is used if the base language is available. Specifically, if the language `de-at` (Austrian German) is not available but `de` (German) is, Django should use the base language `de` without raising an error.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue is that Django should use the base language if a specified sublanguage is not available but the base language is, instead of raising an error `translation.E004`.</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans:\n\n- Identified code span ids: `check_language_settings_consistent`\n- Explanation of code spans:\n\nThe identified code span `check_language_settings_consistent` concerns the function responsible for checking the consistency of language settings. This function examines if the `LANGUAGE_CODE` specified in the settings belongs to the available language tags. If the code doesn't find the `LANGUAGE_CODE` within the `available_tags`, it returns an error `E004` which is the issue's focus.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span `check_language_settings_consistent` contains the function checking whether the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting is valid by determining if it's included in the set of languages defined by `available_tags`. If not found, it raises the `E004` error, which is the primary issue being addressed.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch:\n\n- List of modified hunks: \n  - Lines 56-64\n- Explanation of each modified hunk:\n\n  The hunk adds an import statement `from django.utils.translation import get_supported_language_variant` to use a utility function. It then modifies the check by trying to retrieve the language variant using `get_supported_language_variant(settings.LANGUAGE_CODE)`. If it cannot find the variant, it catches a `LookupError` and returns the error `E004`. Otherwise, no error is returned.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe hunk adds an import for the `get_supported_language_variant` function and uses it to verify the `LANGUAGE_CODE`. If the variant does not exist and raises a `LookupError`, it returns `E004`; otherwise, it assumes the language is supported.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\nThe patch modifies the `check_language_settings_consistent` function, which is the correct location. This function is responsible for checking if the given `LANGUAGE_CODE` is valid and consistent with the defined languages in the settings.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the `check_language_settings_consistent` function, which is central to the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n\nThe patch replacement dilutes the function that checks directly in `available_tags` by using `get_supported_language_variant`, possibly affecting other checks the original function performed.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe introduction of `get_supported_language_variant` shifts reliance from already executed `available_tags` checks to `get_supported_language_variant`, potentially side-stepping the initial intentions of direct matching in favor and possibly creating unintended new behavior.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\nThe patch appropriately targets the given problem by confirming that a requested sublanguage is checked against its base language and does try reducing mistaken triggering of E004 by sublanguages when base ones exist thus would circumvent the initial explicit validation needs of available_tags, though promising in theory risks unforeseen loopholes.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue conceptually through checking base languages before raising `E004`, adapting through `get_supported_language_variant` use better aligns implementation aligning with user expectation to reduce unnecessary errors based on initial constraints.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

There are no new contradictory issues identified compared to the initial `check_language_settings_consistent` implementation.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. ### Comments on fixing the issue\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch appears to fix the issue effectively. It modifies the function to attempt to obtain a supported language variant and only raise the error if such a variant cannot be found. This behavior changes the previous logic, fulfilling what's suggested in the Django documentation: to use a base language fallback when the specific sublanguage isn't available. Care has been taken to handle errors properly without missing any context.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. ### Scoring the patch\n\n   <score>9</score>"

Understand the identified code spans.\n- Span IDs: `check_language_settings_consistent`\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span `check_language_settings_consistent` is relevant to the issue as it contains the function `check_language_settings_consistent` responsible for checking whether the set `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting is consistent with the available languages. It plays a crucial role in raising the `translation.E004` error when the language code is missing from the available tags.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch.\n- Modified Hunks:\n  - Modified Hunk 1: Lines 59 to 62\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the function `check_language_settings_consistent` to address the issue of recognizing valid base languages even if the specific sublanguage is not listed. It introduces:\n1. Retrieval of the `LANGUAGE_CODE`.\n2. Extraction of the base language from the `LANGUAGE_CODE`.\n3. Verification if either the full language code or the base language is within `available_tags`.\nThis ensures `translation.E004` is only raised if both the sublanguage and the base language are unavailable.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function, `check_language_settings_consistent`.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues or contradict the existing code span.

Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the core issue by ensuring that the error `translation.E004` is not raised if a base language for a specified sublanguage is available. The logic to extract and check the base language handles the issue as described in the error report, aligning with Django's documented behavior. The patch appears efficient and falls into no common LLM pitfalls such as missing edge cases. Therefore, it is well-formed and solves the reported issue effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

According to Django documentation, in such a case, Django should use the base language.

This span defines a function called check_language_settings_consistent which checks if the language settings in Django are consistent. Specifically, it examines if the LANGUAGE_CODE setting is in the available_tags, and if not, it raises the translation.E004 error. This is directly relevant to the issue since it is the function responsible for the problematic error being raised.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch includes modification in django/core/checks/translation.py:\n1. Line 59: Assigns `language_code` to `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE`.\n2. Line 60: Extracts base language from the `language_code` by splitting it at the \"-\" character.\n3. Line 62: Checks if either the full language code or the base language is available in `available_tags`. If not, it returns the error E004.\nThe modification ensures that the error is only raised if neither the sublanguage nor its corresponding base language is available.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The identified code span and the modified hunk both refer to `check_language_settings_consistent`, the function responsible for validating the LANGUAGE_CODE setting.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It correctly checks for the presence of both the sublanguage and the base language in the `available_tags` set, aligning with the Django documentation. The code spans are properly referenced, and there are no contradictions with the existing logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue correctly by adding logic to account for sublanguages. It checks if either the full language code or the base language is available before raising translation.E004. There are no common mistakes like missing necessary checks, introducing new bugs, or overcomplicating the solution.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
