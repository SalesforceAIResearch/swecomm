Modifying the `draw` method in `Axes3D` class.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modification in the draw method of Axes3D class**:\n   - A new visibility check is added at the beginning of the `draw` method.\n   - The conditional `if not self.get_visible(): return` is added, which stops the method execution if the `Axes3D` object is set to be invisible. This ensures that if `set_visible(False)` is called, the drawing routine exits early, making the subplot not render and therefore appear invisible.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The `draw` method is the appropriate place to add visibility checks since it's directly responsible for rendering the 3D subplot. Adding an early return if the object is set to invisible ensures the subplot does not get drawn, aligning with the reported issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a new issue subtly by stopping execution without drawing certain essential components maybe affected somewhat like leftover allocations by an invisible 3D axes. However, the stopping rendering part itself doesn\u2019t raise other conflicts with identified spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly checks the `visible` attribute and returns early in the `draw` method of `Axes3D`, preventing an invisible subplot from being rendered. This aligns with the requested behavior in the issue description. The patch aligns with the conventional logic to handle component visibility by short-circuit render routines in `draw` calls.Thus, it does appear to correctly fix the stated issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "Sure, I will proceed with evaluating the candidate patch.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that `set_visible()` method does not work for 3D plots created using the Matplotlib library. Despite setting `set_visible(False)`, the 3D subplot remains visible.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n\n#### List of Span IDs:\n- Axes3D.draw\n- Axes3D.clear\n- Axes3D\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Axes3D.draw**:\n  This code span includes the `draw` method which is responsible for rendering the 3D axes. It's relevant because it potentially can support `set_visible()` by bypassing rendering actions when visibility is set to `False`.\n\n- **Axes3D.clear**:\n  This code span includes the `clear` method of the `Axes3D` class. It might need to reset other attributes that are linked to visibility, though it may not directly affect the `set_visible()` issue if that functionality is handled in the `draw` method.\n\n- **Axes3D**:\n  This code span includes the class definition of `Axes3D`. It outlines attributes and methods that collectively form the 3D axes functionality. This span is crucial for understanding the context in which `set_visible()` operating within a plot configuration.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n\n#### List of modified hunks:\n1. Addition of visibility check in the `draw` method.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**: \n   - **Original**: \n     ```python\n    @martist.allow_rasterization\n    def draw(self, renderer):\n        ...\n     ```\n   - **Modified**: \n     ```python\n    @martist.allow_rasterization\n    def draw(self, renderer):\n        if not self.get_visible():\n            return\n        ...\n     ```\n   - **Explanation**:\n     This modified hunk introduces a check at the beginning of the `draw` method. The check verifies whether the `Axes3D` instance is set to visible or not using `self.get_visible()`. If it is not visible, the method returns immediately without performing rendering actions, effectively skipping the drawing process.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The `set_visible` attribute would be most relevant in the context of the `draw` method, which is responsible for rendering the axes. By adding the visibility check here, it effectively skips the drawing process when visibility is set to `False`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears to be functional and logically correct within the given context of the `draw` method. There don't seem to be any new issues introduced by this check. The identified code spans do not contradict the proposed changes.\nHowever, skipping rendering actions in `draw` when visibility is False must ensure that the Plot's state and subsequent renderings aren't otherwise impacted, though this requires running extended tests.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by adding a visibility check within the `draw` method, ensuring the subplot is not rendered when its visibility is set to `False`. This change aligns well with how the visibility toggle is intended to function, ensuring accurate rendering control over the 3D axes.\n\nCompared to common mistakes made by LLMs, this patch does not introduce redundant or unnecessary complexities. The change is direct and specifically targets the problematic absence of a visibility check in rendering.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "## Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\nThe issue reported is that the `set_visible()` method doesn't work as expected for 3D subplots in Matplotlib. Specifically, setting `set_visible(False)` should make a subplot invisible, but instead, the subplot remains visible.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe problem is with Matplotlib's 3D plots where calling ax.set_visible(False) does not correctly hide the subplot as it is supposed to.\n</issue_exp>\n\n## Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of Span IDs:\n- Axes3D.draw\n- Axes3D.clear\n- Axes3D\n\nExplanation for each identified code span:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n<span_id=\"Axes3D.draw\">: This code span includes the core logic of rendering or drawing the 3D axes. Seeing its relevance, the visibility issue should likely be addressed here to halt the drawing process when the axes are set to invisible.\n\n<span_id=\"Axes3D.clear\">: This is the method to clear the axis, which might give an insight into how visibility and other parameters are reset. It\u2019s less central than draw(), but understanding overall state management can be insightful.\n\n<span_id=\"Axes3D\">: This code span provides an overview of the Axes3D class definition. It initializes and defines different characteristics of a 3d Axis. It forms an essential part to understand the context of the method\u2019s location and how they fit together functionally in the class structure. \n</code_span_exp>\n\n## Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of Modified Hunks:\n1. Modified Hunk in `axes3d.py` @ line 389-390\n\nExplanation for each modified hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe introduced condition in the `draw` method checks if the visibility of the axis is set to False using the `get_visible()` method, and if so, returns early from the method without rendering anything. This correctly handles the scenario where the axis should not be visible.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is indeed fixing the correct function. The `draw` method is the right place to modify because the issue affects the visibility of drawn (or rendered) objects. Adding the visibility check here ensures that the axis is not drawn if invisible.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce new issues. The visibility check does not contradict or conflict with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Step 6: Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch uses the existing `get_visible()` method to determine visibility, which seems a reasonable solution for the given problem. According to the common mistakes LLM-generated patches may have, this one notably avoids introducing unrelated changes, keeps performance implications at bay, maintains logical coherence, and adheres to Matplotlib's existing method for determining component visibility.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n## Step 7: Scoring\n\n<score>10</score>"
