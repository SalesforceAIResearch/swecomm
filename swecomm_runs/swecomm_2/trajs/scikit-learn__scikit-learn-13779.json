Explain in your own words what the issue is about.**\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the `VotingClassifier`'s `fit` method fails when `sample_weight` is provided, but one of the estimators has been set to `None`. This results in an `AttributeError` because the code does not properly handle the case where an estimator is `None` within the `sample_weight` support.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans. First provide a list of span ids.**\n- `_BaseVoting.fit`\n- `_parallel_fit_estimator`\n\n**Then explain how each of the identified code spans are relevant to the issue.**\n<code_span_exp>\n- `_BaseVoting.fit`: This span includes the main code for fitting the ensemble model. It needs modification to appropriately handle cases where some of the estimators are `None`, including those that do not support `sample_weight`.\n- `_parallel_fit_estimator`: This span encompasses the function that performs the fit operation for each estimator. It should handle cases where estimators are `None` to prevent errors during the `fit`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch. First curate a list of modified hunks.**\n- Changes around line 68-69 of the `fit` function in `voting.py`.\n- Changes around lines 90-107 of `voting.py`.\n\n**For each modified hunk, explain what it's doing.**\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1 (Lines 68-69):** Adds a comment in the docstring of the `fit` method to state that estimators set to `None` will be ignored during fitting.\n- **Hunk 2 (Lines 90-107):** Introduces logic to filter out `None` estimators before performing fit operations. It correctly processes lists of valid estimators to handle `None` values and performs the fitting operation only on valid classifiers. It then assigns these valid classifiers to `self.named_estimators_`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.**\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function, `_BaseVoting.fit`, where the main logic for the issue resides. This function is central to fitting the voting ensemble and correctly processing its individual estimators.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce new issues and properly addresses the contributor's concern through conditional checks and filtering of `None` estimators before processing further in the `fit` method. There are no contradictions with what was outlined in the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully filters out `None` estimators and handles the required `sample_weight` checks without resulting in `AttributeError`, which was the cause of the issue. Given the primary function changes in `_BaseVoting.fit`, the code effectively dodges operations on `None` while ensuring required conditions without causing the exception encountered.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Finally, give me your score.**\n<score>10</score>"

Hunk at lines 73-92 ( in sklearn/ensemble/voting.py)\n   Explanation: \n   The line `if step is not None` is added before checking `has_fit_parameter` to ensure that the estimator is checked for `None` before the `sample_weight` support is verified. \n\n2. Hunk at lines 92-109 (in sklearn/ensemble/voting.py)\n   Explanation:\n   Added an extra check to `named_estimators_` by ensuring `if e is not None` to avoid assigning `None` values to the bunch of named estimators.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct section of code. The checks for validating the estimators and fitting them are located within the `fit` method, which include ensuring `None` values are appropriately handled.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues. It correctly adds checks to skip `None` values both in the `sample_weight` verification as well as when populating the named_estimators.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch cures the defect indicated in the issue. By verifying each estimator is not `None` within the `fit` method, it circumvents the `AttributeError`. Furthermore, checking for `None` when populating `named_estimators_` ensures there are no invalid entries. This solves the problem as described.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

This function is invoked within the `fit` method and contains logic to handle sample weights during fit. Making changes here could help handle the situation where one or more of the estimators are `None`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch introduces the following changes:\n- It adds a check `if step is not None` before verifying if `has_fit_parameter(step, 'sample_weight')` within the `fit` method to skip None estimators for sample weight support (between lines 81 and 82).\n- Ensures that in the parallel fitting method invocation, None estimators are filtered using `for clf in clfs if clf is not None` (at line 96).\n\nThis ensures that the VotingClassifier can gracefully handle None estimators when fitting with sample weights, thereby not causing the AttributeError.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location. The relevant sections of the `fit` method directly deal with the handling of the presence of sample weights among the estimators, and they include necessary checks which impact the execution flow when fitting.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and remains consistent with identified code spans. Specifically, it ensures that None estimators are skirted around appropriately and abort inefficient and erroneous passes attempting operations on `NoneType` objects.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the described issue. It adds necessary checks to handle NoneType estimators, ensuring that they are excluded when checking for support for sample weights and during the fitting process. By leveraging logical filtering (`if clf is not None`), the patch safeguards against previous source achilles-heel, classed by our rendered AttributeError.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
