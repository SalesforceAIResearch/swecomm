It is pivotal for chaining query operations, including the `none` implementation.\n  \n- QuerySet._clone: This method is used to create a copy of the current QuerySet and is a key mechanism called by `_chain`. It ensures the integrity of the QuerySet when modifications are made.\n  \n- QuerySet: Represents the class for lazy database lookup for a set of objects. The issue at hand is related to how this QuerySet object behaves during union operations and subsequent transformations.\n\n- QuerySet._combinator_query: This method combines querysets using the specified combinator (e.g., union).

If so, it clones the query and sets `combined_queries` to an empty tuple, then sets the query to empty. This ensures even combined querysets can be cleared effectively.\n\n- In the file `django/forms/models.py`, the form handling has been refined:\n  - Before: After checks and running validators, the `qs` variable was directly returned.\n  - After: An extra check for an empty value (`if not value`) is added. If the field is not filled out, `self.queryset.none()` is called to ensure empty queryset behavior, addressing the fundamental problem in form submission handling.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is applied at the correct locations:\n- The changes to `_chain` and `none` in `QuerySet` ensure query vesion preservation and correct emptying.\n- The change in `ModelMultipleChoiceField` (`django/forms/models.py`) ensures correct form submission behavior.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere do not appear to be any new issues introduced:\n- The patch in `none` does not contradict the identified spans and ensures appropriate resetting of the combined queries.\n- The check for empty form submission aligns with expected behavior without disrupting identified code spans functions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adequately resolves the issue by addressing the query combination emptying and form submission problem:\n- However, attention to potential unforeseen side effects of cloning logic in `_chain` could be prudent (but inline expectancies appear satisfied.)\n- Known LLM-generated patch pitfalls like not fully clearing required states are irrelevant here upon confirming complete field eliminations and cross-method harmonization.\nIt convincingly doesn\u2019t fall into cataloged common mistakes like overlooking conditionality\u2014not only empty-check appending convenient fixes implementation errors with clarified specificity.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This appears intended to ensure that an empty union result isn't treated as containing all possible objects.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch adjusts the `union` method of the `QuerySet` class, which is the correct location for fixing the described issue as `union` is directly responsible for combining query results.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces additional logic in the `union` function of `QuerySet`. While it ensures an empty result from a union returns as an empty QuerySet, it has potential performance and correctness impacts if not all cases where `result` could be improperly evaluated. It creates no evident direct contradiction with the identified spans but the logic introducing a `none()` condition after generic check of emptiness should be in-sync with how Django\u2019s querysets evaluate emptiness ensuring no adverse parts of collector calls affecting original cloning, restarting unintended mutations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch agains the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch tries to address the specific issue by adding an if-check for empty results in the `union` method. This change appears to provide defensive checks ensuring combined query results returning unexpectedly `empty` state defaults correctly without items. Potential mistakes weren't explicitly found though the key aspects pertain around validate conditions guarding against possible empty findings. One must verify within broader codebase usage without inadvertently broad implications invariant edge scenarios. Collaborative test-data validating empty satisfactions must ascertain overall correctness though symbolic lint-guards typically safeguard the updated conditions appearing adequate.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

I'm not 100% sure it's a bug, but it does seem strange. With this code (excuse the bizarre example filtering):\nclass Publication(models.Model):\n\tpass\nclass Article(models.Model):\n\tpublications = models.ManyToManyField(to=Publication, blank=True, null=True)\nclass ArticleForm(forms.ModelForm):\n\tpublications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\n\t\tPublication.objects.filter(id__lt=2) | Publication.objects.filter(id__gt=5),\n\t\trequired=False,\n\t)\n\tclass Meta:\n\t\tmodel = Article\n\t\tfields = [\"publications\"]\nclass ArticleAdmin(admin.ModelAdmin):\n\tform = ArticleForm\nThis works well. However, changing the ModelMultipleChoiceField queryset to use union() breaks things.\npublications = forms.ModelMultipleChoiceField(\n\tPublication.objects.filter(id__lt=2).union(\n\t\tPublication.objects.filter(id__gt=5)\n\t),\n\trequired=False,\n)\nThe form correctly shows only the matching objects. However, if you submit this form while empty (i.e. you didn't select any publications), ALL objects matching the queryset will be added. Using the OR query, NO objects are added, as I'd expect.\n</issue_description>\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using `QuerySet.union()` and submitting a form without any selection, all objects in the queryset are returned and added, which is incorrect. In contrast, using the `|` operator (logical OR) results in no objects being added, which is the expected correct behavior when no selection is made.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n**Code Span ID List:**\n- QuerySet._chain\n- QuerySet._clone\n- QuerySet\n- QuerySet._combinator_query\n- QuerySet.none\n- QuerySet.union\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **QuerySet._chain (lines 1277-1287)**:\n    Relevant because `_chain` creates a new `QuerySet` object with the necessary state, which is used internally by other functions in `QuerySet`.\n    \n2. **QuerySet._clone (lines 1289-1301)**:\n    `_clone` creates a copy of the current `QuerySet`.

The patch modifies the `none()` method in the `QuerySet` class.\n2. The new code checks if `clone.query` has an attribute named `combinator` before setting it as empty, indicating that special handling is done for combined queries to ensure they correctly return an empty result.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function - the `none()` method in the `QuerySet` class - which is directly relevant to the issue described. Since the problem arises when `.none()` is called on combined queries, altering `QuerySet.none` to address how combined queries are managed is the correct approach.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't conflict with any of the identified code spans.

No new issues are introduced by this patch.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the known issue by ensuring that when `QuerySet.none()` is called on a combined query, the combined query correctly returns an empty result instead of all objects. It avoids common pitfalls like not considering combinator existence, which was effectively managed in the patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>9</score>"

QuerySet._clone: This method provides a lightweight alternative to deepcopy() by returning a copy of the current QuerySet. It\u2019s relevant because it maintains the state of the original QuerySet while offering a fresh copy for further operations.\n3. QuerySet: Represents a lazy database lookup for a set of objects. Understanding the internals of this class is fundamental to grasp how different queries and combinations influence each other.\n4. QuerySet._combinator_query: This method handles combining multiple QuerySets using union, intersection, or difference, ensuring the resulting QuerySet maintains the necessary attributes. It\u2019s relevant because the issue involves the union operation combining Queries.\n5. QuerySet.none: This method is designed to return an empty QuerySet. The necessity here is clear since the problem involves the behavior of this method in conjunction with union queries.\n6. QuerySet.union: This method manages performing a SQL UNION operation across multiple QuerySets. It is relevant as the code with union queries Alice presents issues with the none() functionality.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1 (lines 555-567 in django/db/models/sql/query.py):\n    Adds a condition to check if either 'self' or 'rhs' is empty using the is_empty() method. If either is empty, the set_empty() method is called on self, and the function exits early, preventing any combination operation.\n- Hunk 2 (lines 1784-1790 in django/db/models/sql/query.py):\n    Adds new functionalities to the set_empty() method, setting the combinator to None and combined_queries to an empty tuple to ensure the queries are reset properly.\n    Modifies the is_empty() method to include a check for empty combined queries.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct locations. It modifies the set_empty() and is_empty() methods to accurately reset or check combined processes. These changes should cover scenarios involving any combined query, not just union().\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no new issues introduced that contradict any of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to address the core issue by modifying the behavior of query combination when either self or rhs is empty. It uses set_empty() in an appropriate manner considering the problem scenario with combined queries. It checks both individual and combined queries to ensure no unintended results return when none() should yield an empty set.\n\nCommon potential LLM issues involving incomplete resets or unhandled edge cases are mitigated here. The patch is comprehensive in providing necessary resets for the internal states of combined queries.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
