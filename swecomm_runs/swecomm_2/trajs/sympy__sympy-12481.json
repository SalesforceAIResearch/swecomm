                    "msg": "Let's analyze the provided information step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the issue\nThe issue provided explains a problem in the way the `Permutation` constructor handles non-disjoint cycles, resulting in a `ValueError`. Instead of constructing the proper permutation, it errors out when encountering non-disjoint cycles.\n\n```issue_exp\nThe issue is that the `Permutation` constructor in the `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py` file fails when encountering non-disjoint cycles, raising a `ValueError`. For instance, `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])` should construct the identity permutation but instead raises an error. The expected behavior is that non-disjoint cycles should be allowed and applied sequentially.\n```\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the identified code spans\nFirst, we list the span IDs:\n- Permutation.__new__\n- Permutation.list\n\nNow we provide explanations for each of the identified code spans:\n\n```code_span_exp\nThe span `Permutation.__new__` (lines 801-929) shows the constructor method for the Permutation class. The relevant portion is around lines 850-925, where the code inspects the provided cycles and throws a `ValueError` if there are repeated elements, which is where the issue stems from.\n\nThe span `Permutation.list` (lines 1006-1045) deals with transforming a permutation into its list form, possibly trimming unmoved elements. Although not directly related to the creation of permutations from non-disjoint cycles, this method clarifies the handling of permutations' internal list representation, potentially influenced by the initial construction handling.\n```\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the candidate patch\nLet's look at the modified hunks:\n\n#### Hunk 1 (lines 897-901):\n**Before:**\n```before_patch\nif has_dups(temp):\n    if is_cycle:\n        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve '\n        'cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')\n```\n\n**After:**\n```after_patch\nif has_dups(temp):\n    if is_cycle:\n        # Allow non-disjoint cycles by applying them sequentially\n        # from left to right to an identity permutation.\n        # This change resolves the issue with non-disjoint cycles.\n        pass\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')\n```\n\nExplanation of the modified hunk:\n\n```patch_exp\nThe patch modifies the section of the `Permutation` constructor where it checks for duplicate elements. The specific modification is the removal of the `ValueError` for repeated elements within a cycle. The updated code now leaves a comment explaining the intention to allow non-disjoint cycles while leaving the block empty using `pass`, effectively bypassing the exception previously raised.\n```\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n```correct_location_exp\nThe patch correctly targets the portion of the `Permutation.__new__` method where repeated elements trigger a `ValueError` exception, which is directly responsible for the issue described.\n```\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\nWhile the patch bypasses the exception, it does not provide the necessary implementation to correctly handle non-disjoint cyclic permutations. Additionally, merely passing the block does not ensure that these cycles will be applied sequentially as required.\n\n```new_issues_exp\nThe patch does not introduce new immediate issues, but it fails to actually implement the solution for applying the non-disjoint cycles sequentially. Adding a simple `pass` statement is not sufficient and does not ensure the cycles get applied correctly.\n```\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\nThis patch aligns with the typical issues where the LLM-generated fix is incomplete or overly simplistic. It correctly avoids raising an exception for non-disjoint cycles, but it falls short by not providing the necessary logic to construct the permutation correctly. Essentially, it bypasses error handling without implementing a result-producing mechanism, thus, it will not fix the issue in practice.\n\n```fix_issue_exp\nThe patch does not fix the issue as it only comments out the error handling via `pass` without implementing the mechanism to apply the non-disjoint cycles sequentially. This is a common mistake in LLM-generated patches where the change is superficially correct but lacks actual functional improvement.\n```\n\n### Final Score\nBased on the above, this patch inadequately addresses the issue and leaves part of the implementation missing.\n\n<score>-1</score>"

The correct behavior should be to apply the cycles in the given order and return the resulting permutation.\n\n**Explanation:**\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the Permutation constructor throws a ValueError when provided with non-disjoint cycles (cycles having repeated elements). Instead, it should process these cycles sequentially and construct the appropriate Permutation object.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**Identified Code Spans:** `Permutation.__new__`, `Permutation.list`\n\n**Explanation of Each Identified Code Span:**\n\n1. **Span ID: Permutation.__new__**\n   - **Explanation:**\n     <code_span_exp>\n     This code span is within the `Permutation` class constructor method `__new__`. It includes the logic that processes the input arguments for creating a permutation. The constructor processes whether an input cycle contains duplicate elements and raises a `ValueError` if duplicates exist. This is directly related to the issue since modifying this part of the code is necessary to properly handle the non-disjoint cycles.\n     </code_span_exp>\n\n2. **Span ID: Permutation.list**\n   - **Explanation:**\n    <code_span_exp>\n    This method returns the permutation in list form.

It bypasses the `ValueError` when `is_cycle` is True, thus allowing non-disjoint cycles. The intention seems to encode the new required behavior\u2014to handle these cycles sequentially\u2014but no actual computation is included within the `pass` statement. More logic would later be needed to ensure cycles are processed sequentially.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check the Correct Location\n\n**Explanation of Fix Location:**\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, it is addressing the correct location by focusing on the constructor (`__new__`) responsible for handling the input cycles and previous exclusions based on duplication checks.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\n**Explanation of Potential New Issues:**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe changes involve ignoring duplicate elements if they belong to non-disjoint cycles but do nothing to handle these elements sequentially or correctly transform them to construct the permutation properly. Therefore, leaving it as pass results not changing and can propagate errors in permutation building.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n**Explanation if the Patch Fixes the Issue:**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nNo, the patch does not effectively address the issue. The permissive use of `pass` skips the necessary logic that would allow processing cycles sequentially to form the correct permutation. A patch that avoids raising a `ValueError` but also correctly consolidates the defined behavior is called for to resolve the cycles appropriately.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score\n\nWhile the patch moves in the right direction revolving non-disjoint cycles, the incomplete implementation (use of `pass`) doesn't process the non-disjoint cycles correctly.\n\n<score>0</score>"

This section of the code pertains to validating and shaping input cycles to form a proper permutation, aligning perfectly with the described issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nUpon inspecting the patch and the affected code,\n- The patch modifies the flow primarily for instances where non-disjoint cycles occur.\n- One minor potential issue lies in whether forming the array `aform` strictly based on `perm_map.keys()` omits essential checks on `size` or array completeness.\n- It might defermentally affect parts of the algorithm outside specific checks or facilitating cycle completeness within sizes spanning outside `perm_map`.\n\nIt does not directly contradict any current code dictating its formation per cycle or form consistency.\n\n\nHowever, the logic states to raise an exception within none exact scenarios depicted necessary (outside granted relevance scope abiding intents outlined).\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Check if Patch can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears properly designed on applying non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order:\n- Preserving intended handling ensures encountering repetitive elements represented entirely accommodating said permutations vs previous validation constraint affirming.\n- Properly directed including both intended match efforts remain \n\nVerifying global influence opposedly scoring hold behavior defensive site preservation uniformly maintained post validating cyclic representation.\n\nA common mistake shows cyclical operations collection manipulations otherwise rightly settled articulated nonetheless inspecting any creeping additional permissiormonitor safety ensuring validation checks array reliability with few testing specific case highlights safety encompassing entire creation set generally existing pre-validation correlation consistent confirming. \n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>8</score>"

It currently raises a `ValueError` if repeated elements are found and deals with converting either array-form or cycle-form inputs into the internal `array_form`.\n\n**Span ID: `Permutation.list`**\nThis method returns the internal `array_form` as an explicit list, possibly extending or trimming based on the given `size`. It's relevant for understanding how the final permutations are formed and returned.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe constructor (`Permutation.__new__`) is directly involved in processing input cycles into valid permutations. The current behavior is problematic because it raises a `ValueError` for non-disjoint cycles instead of applying them sequentially.\n\nThe `Permutation.list` method deals with how permutations are outputted as explicit arrays, ensuring the permutations respect the structure (like sizes) specified during construction.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Patch Explanation:\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n1. Modified test cases in `test_permutations.py`\n2. Updated docstring and code logic in `permutations.py` constructor\n\n**Modified Hunk Explanations:**\n\n1. **Test cases in** `sympy/combinatorics/tests/test_permutations.py`:\n   - New assertions were added to validate that `Permutation` correctly handles non-disjoint cycles by checking example cases like `[[0, 1], [0, 1]]` and `[[0, 1], [1, 2]]`.\n\n2. **Docstring and constructor updates in** `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`:\n   - Added explanations and examples to accept and correctly process non-disjoint cycles left-to-right.\n   - Adjusted logical flow in the constructor to handle these non-disjoint cycles appropriately without raising a `ValueError`. This includes applying cycles in sequence and checking for non-canonical cycles with nested application until fully resolved.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch introduces new test assertions to confirm the correct handling of non-disjoint cycles and updates the `Permutation` class's __new__ constructor to process these cycles left-to-right. The specific changes to __new__ build a cumulative cycle from the arguments and convert it into a working array form.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location:\n\nThe patch modifies the correct constructor function (`__new__`) associated with creating `Permutation` objects, addressing the problem directly where permutations are built and validated.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct `Permutation.__new__` constructor where permutations are created and validated.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introduction of New Issues:\n\nThe patch alters some core logic around `ValueError` handling and ensures no disjoint cycle problems if cycles are sequences. It does not seem to introduce regressions or logical errors contradicting the previous behavior maintained in other code spans (`Permutation.list`). Also, the patch maintains compatibility without creating new access patterns or invariant issues around `array_form`.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any noticeable new issues. It adheres to necessary value check conformity while introducing the viewpoint accommodating non-disjoint cycles correctly handled sequentially.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Fixing the Issue:\n\nThe proposed change logically aligns with the problem statements ensuring `Permutation` works as expected processing non-disjoint cycles. Followed considerations avoiding known LLMs mistakes, ensuring integrative steps adjusting functional increase cap, embedding invariant checks covered so falls correctly adhering to requirements. The test additions strengthen the automated checking validating runtime integrity overall potential span identification unders baking omissions addressed, consistency maintained.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue as described.

Changes to the constructor `__new__` in `permutations.py`:\n   - **Before:** Raised a `ValueError` on non-disjoint cycles.\n   - **After:** Modified the constructor to handle non-disjoint cycles correctly by applying them in left-to-right order, using the `Cycle` class.\n\n   **Explanation:** These modifications ensure the logic inside the constructor now accommodates non-disjoint cycles by iterating and applying them using a Cycle instance.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct location:\n- Modification in the constructor `Permutation.__new__` is appropriate as it deals with cycle parsing and the error-raising mechanisms the issue describes.\n- Relevant tests and docstring updates align with scenarios discussed in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues according to the given context and identified code spans.

Understand the Identified Code Spans:\n\n#### List of the span ids:\n- `Permutation.__new__`\n- `Permutation.list`\n\n#### Explanation of each identified code span:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `span_id=Permutation.__new__`: This span corresponds to the `__new__` method in the `Permutation` class. It is the constructor method and is relevant to the issue since it currently raises an error when encountering non-disjoint cycles. This span contains logic for handling input and duplicates which is where the handling of non-disjoint cycles should be modified.\n\n2. `span_id=Permutation.list`: This span represents the `list` method in the `Permutation` class. This method is responsible for converting the permutation object to a list format and may be relevant when constructing and representing the permutation affected by non-disjoint cycles.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch:\n\n#### List of modified hunks:\nThere is a single modified hunk present in the patch.\n\n#### Explanation of the modified hunk among before and after patch:\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk Modified**:\n  - **Before Patch**: The code raises a `ValueError` if duplicates are found in `temp` and `is_cycle` is `True`.\n  - **After Patch**: The code now allows non-disjoint cycles by doing nothing (`pass`) when duplicates are found and `is_cycle` is `True`.\n\n**Explanation**: \nThe patch modifies the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class by bypassing the `ValueError` that is raised when duplicates are found within cycle-formations. By using `pass` instead of raising an error, it allows the constructor to handle the cycles.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check Correct Function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, this patch is modifying the correct function. The identified bug concerns the handling of non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` constructor, which is covered in the `Permutation.__new__` method.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check for New Issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch properly stops raising an error on non-disjoint cycles, but it introduces no new functional measures to ensure these non-disjoint cycles lead to the correct permutation being constructed left-to-right as reported by the issue. Also, it does not update any logic elsewhere like constructing arrays or generating the final list, which signals incompleteness by potentially contradicting or bypassing the required functions adjacent to duplicate cycles handling.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check Patch's Effectiveness in Fixing the Issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch stops the error from being thrown, but it drops logical considerations of representing non-disjoint cycles correctly in subsequent stages. Common LLM mistakes include not finalizing necessary steps, e.g., ensuring the result of applying cycles left-to-right coercion. Thus, this patch lacks other logical changes that fully resolve and correctly compute the resulting permutation from left-to-right application.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring:\n\n<score>2</score> \n\nThe given score of 2 is relative to correctly addressing a part of the issue dealing with the raised error but failing to thoroughly amend cycles handling intricately as obliged."

When non-disjoint cycles are passed as arguments (e.g., `Permutation([[0,1],[0,1]])`), the constructor raises a `ValueError`. The intended behavior is to apply the non-disjoint cycles in a left-to-right order and return the resulting permutation. The problem should not prevent the construction of such permutations but should smoothly compute and return the result without raising an error.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is with the `Permutation` constructor raising a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are passed, such as `Permutation([[0, 1], [0, 1]])`. Instead of raising an error, the cycles should be applied in left-to-right order, and the resulting permutation should be returned.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n1. `Permutation.__new__`\n2. `Permutation.list`\n\n**Explanation for `Permutation.__new__`:**\nThis code span includes the constructor implementation of the `Permutation` object.

This is directly where the proposed fix would be applied since the issue is with the constructor method handling non-disjoint cycles.\n2. **Permutation.list**: This method returns the permutation as an explicit list. It involves logic for handling and returning the list form, but it\u2019s tangentially related to the issue since it processes permutations into list forms, the task at issue once cycles are resolved.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. Original code line 899 \u2013 901:\n   ```python\n   if has_dups(temp):\n       if is_cycle:\n           raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))\n   ```\n\n   Proposed change:\n   ```python\n   if has_dups(temp):\n       if is_cycle:\n           pass\n   ```\n\nExplanation:\nThe provided patch allows permutations to progress even if there are duplicates (non-disjoint cycles) when `is_cycle` is true. Instead of raising a `ValueError`, the code now just passes, enabling non-disjoint cycles.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function and location. It targets the `__new__` constructor of the `Permutation` class, which is responsible for handling the input arguments.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch could potentially introduce new issues since simply allowing duplicates without additional processing might result in improper permutations. Ideally, the code should handle each non-disjoint cycle in a manner that results in the correct permutation by applying the cycles left to right, as specified in the issue.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nNo, the patch does not completely fix the issue as it stands; it only prevents the `ValueError` from being raised without doing the required permutation computation with non-disjoint cycles. The cycles must interleave their elements left-to-right to form the correct resultant permutation, which the current patch does not achieve.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>0</score>"
