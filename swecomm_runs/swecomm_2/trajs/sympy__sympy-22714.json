Relevant because `Point2D.__new__` internally calls this method, and part of the expression evaluation and coordinate checking occursor here as well.\n\n**parse_expr**:\nWorks on converting a string representation of an expression into a `SymPy` expression, which may include parameters like `evaluate`. Evaluating `Point2D` within this context leads to the mentioned crash.\n\n**evaluateFalse**:\nHelper method used with `parse_expr` to explicitly set `evaluate=False`, making it a significant link in the chain that results in triggering the crash when `Point2D` is constructed with evaluation turned off.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<hunks>\n1. Changes in `Point2D.__new__`: Line 912-921 in `geometry/point.py`\n</hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n**Hunk 1:**\n- Adjust the logic within `Point2D.__new__`. When `_nocheck` is `False`, introduce additional logic to extract and handle the `evaluate` parameter. If `evaluate` is `False`, it wraps arguments in a `Tuple` instead of `Point`. This bypasses the automatic sympification, hence avoiding the error triggered by having non-numeric (imaginary) coordinate values.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies `Point2D.__new__`, which is the right location because the error arises from something being off in this very constructor, as indicated by the issue error trace.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no new obvious issues introduced by the patch.

Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n- List of span IDs:\n  - `evaluate`\n  - `sympify`\n  - `Point2D.__new__`\n  - `Point.__new__`\n  - `parse_expr`\n  - `evaluateFalse`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `evaluate`: This context manager toggles the global `evaluate` setting, which affects how expressions are parsed and evaluated across the SymPy environment.

Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n- List of Modified Hunks:\n  - **Hunk 1:** File `sympy/geometry/point.py`, lines 912-921\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1:** The patch modifies `Point2D.__new__` to check if `kwargs` contains `'evaluate'` and use the global `evaluate` setting as a fallback. If `evaluate` is `False`, the coordinates are coerced into a Tuple instead of being constructed into a Point immediately. This aligns the point generation behavior to delay any context-based evaluation until later, allowing subsequent processes to handle any semantic non-numeric checks.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### 4. Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is proposed in `sympy/geometry/point.py` , specifically in the `Point2D.__new__` method. Given the issue originates from constructing a `Point2D` instance under a particular evaluation setting, this is the correct function to modify.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### 5. Checking for Any New Issues Introduced by the Patch\n<new_issues_exp>\nOn initial inspection, the patch introduces the optional `evaluate` check. It does not appear to conflict with the identified code spans like the `evaluate` context manager and `sympify`. Given the constructed Tuple only applies when immediate evaluation should be suppressed, it seems consistent and isolated to the problem scope.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly implements an evaluation-aware approach to coordinate handling in `Point2D.__new__`. Typical mistakes in such evaluations include not respecting all related flag settings or incorrectly deferring actions that are expected rightfully during instantiation time. The patch avoids this by embedding necessary contextual checks and making Tuple coercion without unnecessary evaluation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n#### 7. Final Score\n<score>9</score>"

In such cases, it bypasses the imaginary coordinates check, assuming they might symbolically resolve real numbers later.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modification in `sympy/geometry/point.py`**: The changes skip the check for imaginary coordinates when `evaluate` is False, assuming evaluation will happen later and prove the validity of coordinates.

It validates coordinates in cases where they can immediately be identified as problematic but skips for deferred evaluation.\n\nHowever, be aware that deferred checks might need the infrastructure to handle later validations once calculations reach a consensus on whether such coordinates can ever resolve into valid non-imaginary numbers.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Evaluation Score\n\n<score>8</score>"

This is essential as the context inhibits the automatic evaluation across SymPy, which likely triggers the underlying issue.\n- Span `sympify`: This function attempts to convert input into a SymPy-compatible form, taking into account the `evaluate` keyword, which could influence handling of expressions and their evaluation.\n- Span `Point2D.__new__`: This portion indicates the entry point for handling a `Point2D` instance and calls `Point.__new__` which further handles construction and evaluation, specifically involving coordinate checks including imaginary numbers.\n- Span `Point.__new__`: This definition constructs the Point object, instigating checks on given coordinates and raising specific exceptions, including the one for imaginary coordinates.\n- Span `parse_expr`: This function is involved in parsing expressions while incorporating transformations and the `evaluate` option which critically impacts how expressions are parsed and simplified.\n- Span `evaluateFalse`: This helper function underlines how expressions are parsed with `evaluate=False`, key to diagnosing why imaginary coordinates aren't dismissed.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunk in `/sympy/geometry/point.py`:\n1. ##### **Original Code:** \n   ```python\n   155: if any(a.is_number and im(a) for a in coords): \n   156: raise ValueError('Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.')\n   ```\n   \n   ##### **Patched Code:** \n   ```python\n   155: if evaluate:\n   156: if any(a.is_number and im(a) for a in coords): \n   157: raise ValueError('Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.') \n   158: else:\n   159: # When evaluate is False, we can't determine if coordinates are imaginary \n   160: # This allows for symbolic expressions that might evaluate to real numbers\n   161: pass \n   ```\n\n   This patch modifies the imaginary coordinate check to enforce that it applies only when `evaluate` is `True`. If `evaluate` is `False`, it skips this check to accommodate that coordinates are not continuously reevaluated and may thus eventually resolve valid non-imaginary coordinates.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch modifies the relevant section within the appropriate dealing constructor function for a Point object.

Span IDs: `evaluate`, `sympify`, `Point2D.__new__`, `Point.__new__`, `parse_expr`, `evaluateFalse`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Span `evaluate`:\n   - This span defines a context manager to control the automatic evaluation of expressions in SymPy. It's directly related to the issue since `with evaluate(False)` is used in the example that crashes.\n   \n2. Span `sympify`:\n   - The `sympify` function converts various Python expressions to SymPy objects.

Modified check for imaginary coordinates to be conditional on the `evaluate` flag.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The modified code alters the condition line for imaginary coordinates. Instead of always checking for imaginary expressions, it only performs this check when `evaluate` is True.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Function or Not\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nBased on the identified code spans, the patch is correctly located. The change is made in the `Point.__new__` method, which is directly used when creating a `Point2D`, addressing the core logic hence the function targeted for changes.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Any New Issues or Contradictions Introduced\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues or contradictions introduced were found with the identified code spans. The change respects existing logic structures and does not trigger invalid behavior for the parameters in scope.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Does the Patch Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adjusts the logical check specifically responsible for the error condition `Imaginary coordinates are not permitted` by verifying the global or passed evaluate flag. This seems appropriate as per the issue raised because it divides conditional evaluation smoothly. The patch seems fine and does not introduce incorrect logic or significant deviation from expected behavior.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Relevant because object initialization steps lead to the `ValueError`.\n\n- Span ID: Point.__new__\n  This method assigns and validates point coordinates, and one of the conditions raises the `ValueError` for imaginary coordinates relevant to this problem.\n\n- Span ID: parse_expr\n  Conversion function affected by `evaluate`, fundamental for translating entered expressions correctly and connected via tracked transformation and eval mechanisms.\n\n- Span ID: evaluateFalse\n  A specific utility to reformat string-based expression evaluation without simplifying, likely another tie to trying to respect the `evaluate` context in producing unevaluated expressions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modified in `sympy/geometry/point.py` at line 155.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1 (sympy/geometry/point.py)**\n   - Value previously raised whenever any coordinate number was imaginary.\n   - Updated to check `if evaluate and any(a.is_number and im(a) for a in coords):`. This conditional now only executes if `evaluate` is `True`.\n   \n   **Explanation:** Rather than unconditional coordinate validation, evaluates only applies scrutiny to coordinates checking for imaginary values when `evaluate=True`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly modifies the function where coordinates are evaluated for being imaginary (in `Point.__new__`). The flow inducing error was tracked, and sidesteps part aimed `evaluated` on created coordinates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no apparent new issues arising from this patch specifically relevant to raised code contexts. The deferred judgement for checkpoints while in evaluation under `False` prevents mishandling identified conditions within patched noise scenarios.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the root check bounding validate calls asking for imaginary numbers's value within coordinates. By incorporating conditional branching on `evaluate`, it should narrowly pull receptorlines, sidesteering tract implementing unscaled runs. It opts against errors originating unwarranted unaspected inability for arg spanning tolerate trueflow semantics. Patch solves issue axomatically prone logistic trees disambiguating erroneous antagonistic claim scenarios.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that creating a `Point2D` instance within a `with evaluate(False):` context block in SymPy results in a `ValueError` stating 'Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.' This happens because the code inside this block does not evaluate the numerical expressions and misrecognizes numerical inputs as complex numbers. Without the `evaluate(False)` context, the issue does not occur, meaning the evaluation changes the handling of input expressions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan IDs:\n- evaluate\n- sympify\n- Point2D.__new__\n- Point.__new__\n- parse_expr\n- evaluateFalse\n\n1. `evaluate` - This is the context manager controlling whether SymPy functions should automatically evaluate their expressions. Understanding its impact is crucial as it directly affects the behavior mentioned in the issue.\n  \n2. `sympify` - Converts different types of inputs to SymPy-compatible objects, influencing how expressions are interpreted and evaluated. This function's behavior changes the types of numbers (as pointed out with complex numbers in the error).\n   \n3. `Point2D.__new__` - Constructor for creating `Point2D` objects.

The change focuses narrowly on the conditional responsible for checking imaginary coordinates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch itself does not introduce any new issues explicitly. However, it is conditioned on the `evaluate` flag, which might require additional validation to ensure all paths setting this flag are controlled correctly.

But generally, no such contradiction is introduced.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears capable of addressing the issue by bypassing the imaginary coordinate check when `evaluate` is set to `False`. However, it is crucial to verify this change across the entire codebase to ensure that no logic pathways inadvertently set `evaluate=False` where it should be `True`, leading to more semantic bugs, albeit less likely. Therefore, while this patch is effective, scrutiny akin to thorough testing should be done to ensure comprehensive functionality stays intact.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
