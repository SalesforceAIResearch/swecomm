If so, it proceeds with updating the subplot parameters and adjusting the subplot positions without raising the warning.\n2. Specifically, it adds:\n   ```python\n   if self.get_constrained_layout() is False:\n       self.subplotpars.update(left, bottom, right, top, wspace, hspace)\n       for ax in self.axes:\n           if hasattr(ax, 'get_subplotspec'):\n               ax._set_position(ax.get_subplotspec().get_position(self))\n       self.stale = True\n       return\n   ```\n   before the existing warning message logic.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `subplots_adjust` function which is the correct location to address the issue.

Any changes related to handling the constrained layout would likely affect or involve changes in this function.\n\nConstrainedLayoutEngine: This is relevant as it defines the `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` class, which is a specific type of layout that the issue explicitly mentions (through the `constrained_layout` parameter). Understanding how this engine interacts with the subplots adjustment can give insight into why the warning is being shown undesirably.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of Modified Hunks:\n1. Hunk 1:\n   - Original Code Lines: figure.py: 2410-2417, 2428-2431\n   - Modified Code Lines: figure.py: 2410-2417, 2428-2431\n\n   Explanation:\n   The modified hunk adds checks for `constrained_layout not in [None, False]` instead of just `constrained_layout is not None` in two places:\n   - Line 2414 includes this check within the block of code dealing with the `layout` parameter and `tight_layout`.\n   - Line 2428 includes the same check within the block where neither `layout` nor `tight_layout` are provided but `constrained_layout` might be set.\n\n   This ensures that if `constrained_layout` is explicitly set to `False`, the code does not mistakenly warn about it as incompatible.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly targets the initialization block of the `Figure` class, where layout engines and warnings related to them are managed. This context is appropriate because it's where the layout configurations for figures are processed.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues. It extends existing checks to correctly handle the `False` value for `constrained_layout`. This should not contradict or interfere with the functionality of the identified code spans as it adds an additional logical branch for an existing parameter.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by making sure that `constrained_layout` being set to `False` does not trigger the undesired UserWarning. By accounting for the `False` value explicitly in the conditional statements, it avoids the confusion leading to the warning which was supposed to be triggered only when `constrained_layout` is active (`True` or a dictionary).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
