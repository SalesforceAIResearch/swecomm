It contains the logic that inaccurately handles two-digit year parsing.\n- `parse_http_date_safe`: This function acts as a safe wrapper around `parse_http_date`, returning `None` if an exception occurs. Its functionality includes calling `parse_http_date`, thus any changes to `parse_http_date` need to be compatible to maintain overall reliability.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunks involving lines from `158` to `164` in method headers explanation.\n- Hunk modifying logic from lines `get current year logic` to correct year logic from `173` onwards in the `parse_http_date` function.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch first imports the `datetime` module, which is required to get the current year dynamically.\n- The `try...except` block updated the year-handling algorithm to dynamically calculate the century. It uses the current year, checking if adding the current century puts the year more than 50 years in the future. If so, it adjusts the century backward by 100 years; otherwise, it keeps it in the current century.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Location Correctness:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `parse_http_date` function. This is the appropriate location because the issue centers on correcting its handling of two-digit year parsing.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introduction of New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any conflicting changes with the function logic in `parse_http_date_safe` as it remains a wrapper. However, there may be implicit boundary conditions which haven\u2019t been verified against test case scenarios such as handling exactly on a boundary year input in current logic division.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Verification of Issue Fix:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is almost correct with dynamically increment current year basis fixing generalized method to arrange responsive unit.

Modified handling of two-digit years in `parse_http_date`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Imported datetime module:**\n   ```python\n   import datetime\n   ```\n\n2. **Modified the `parse_http_date` function:** \n   - Added computation of `current_year` and `current_century` to use in century calculation.\n   - Adjusted the logic for converting two-digit years:\n     ```python\n     current_year = datetime.datetime.utcnow().year\n     current_century = current_year // 100 * 100\n     if year + current_century > current_year + 50:\n         year += current_century - 100\n     else:\n         year += current_century\n     ```\n     This logic ensures that years which appear more than 50 years in the future are interpreted correctly according to RFC 7231.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function, `parse_http_date`, which is where the incorrect logic for handling two-digit years originally exists.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and does not contradict with the identified code spans.

It calculates the `current_century` and adjusts the year based on whether adding the current century would place the year more than 50 years in the future. This matches the requirements described in the issue. There is no obvious misuse of datetime manipulation, and the code adheres to the necessary logic.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Give your score:**\n\n<score>10</score>"

The current logic is hardcoded, assigning two-digit years from 0-69 to the 21st century (2000-2069) and from 70-99 to the 20th century (1970-1999), instead of performing a comparison with the current year.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n- parse_http_date\n- parse_http_date_safe\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe span `parse_http_date` (span_id: parse_http_date) is directly relevant as it contains the code that needs to be fixed to adhere to the RFC 7231 guideline.\n\nThe span `parse_http_date_safe` (span_id: parse_http_date_safe) is relevant because it relies on `parse_http_date`, and any updates to `parse_http_date` can affect it. Therefore, it needs to be considered to ensure nothing breaks in this sanity wrapper function.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Updating the docstring to specify the interpretation rules for two-digit years as per RFC 7231.\n   ```python\n   165: For two-digit years, as per RFC 7231, timestamps that appear to be more\n   166: than 50 years in the future are interpreted as representing the most\n   167: recent year in the past that had the same last two digits.\n   ```\n   Explanation: This update clarifies the behavior that the function is expected to follow.\n\n2. Adjusting logic for interpreting two-digit years:\n   ```python\n   182 - 187:\n   (0182)      if year < 100:\n   (0183)          current_year = datetime.datetime.now().year\n   (0184)          current_century = current_year // 100 * 100\n   (0185)          year += current_century\n   (0186)          if year > current_year + 50:\n   (0187)              year -= 100\n   ```\n   Explanation: \n   - It adjusts years below 100 by adding the current century.\n   - If the resulting year exceeds 50 years beyond the current year, it adjusts the year to the most recent past century with the integration of the current century and adjusted to the past century when exceeding 50-year future threshold.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch updates the correct function, `parse_http_date`, where the old hardcoded logic for year adjustments needs to be refactored according to RFC 7231 standards.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are being introduced by the patch. The changes apply surrounding only interpreting two-digit years appropriately, without negatively affecting or contradicting the use of any identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue and aligns the year calculation logic of the `parse_http_date` function with the RFC 7231 requirements. \n1. It calculates years appropriately by dynamically referring to the current year and relevant century.\n2. Adjusts the years exceeding a 50-year forward threshold back into the past.\nOverall, the solution appears to properly resolve the legitimate bounds issue without introducing bugs or misinterpretations typically arising from common LLM mistakes during effective year parameter adjustments in date parsing contexts.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Specifically, it directly adjusts the logic determining which century a two-digit year falls into based on conditions in RFC 7231.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues and does not appear to contradict any other identified code spans. Each identified locking code span has logic that aligns well with the changes, ensuring that the function operates correctly under the new year parsing guidance.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to resolve the issue effectively. It replaces the outdated, hard-coded century logic with more flexible arithmetic based on the current date, per RFC 7231 standards. Common mistakes by LLMs include logical redundancies, syntax errors, or incorrect implementations, none of which are present here. The implementation as plain and appears accurate in solving the outlined problem effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
