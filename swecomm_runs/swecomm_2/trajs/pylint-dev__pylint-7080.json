It calls `_is_ignored_file`, a utility likely useful to determine whether the path should be ignored according to the configured `ignore_list`, `ignore_list_re`, and `ignore_list_paths_re`. If the file is to be ignored, the script `continues` to the next file without processing the current one. The patch aims to prevent further unnecessary checks and adds paths to the modules list only if they are not ignored.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct location within the `expand_modules` function. This is appropriate because `expand_modules` should thoroughly vet paths it processes and respect ignored files. The conditions to skip files should certainly reside in this function.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a usage of `_is_ignored_file`, which is appropriate, and does not contradict or conflict with other essential codes spanning observed behaviors connected to 'why' files are marked for checking.

It brings the missing check for ignored paths directly inside the path processing logic. This improvement will ensure that with recursive checks (`--recursive=y`), PyLint will revere user-configured ignores within files as anticipated. The explanation and help with already existing calls match the facing error directly depictive to the broader occurrences envisioned referencing the coding capabilities, expounding common mistakes like missing essential checks within concerned functions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It might handle files paths and thus should consider the ignore patterns coming from settings including `ignore-paths` to avoid processing unwanted files.\n\n2. PyLinter._discover_files:\n   - **Related to Issue**: This internal method is responsible for discovering files and directories recursively. This part of the codebase needs to incorporate `ignore-paths` considerations to prevent those paths from being scanned in recursive operations.\n\n3. PyLinter.check:\n   - **Related to Issue**: This method represents the main entry point for linting files or modules as supplied by name. The recursive processing branch here should ensure handling ignored paths as part of its logic to meet the users expectations and settings.\n</span_explanation>\n\n<patch_explanation>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Line 110: Adds a call `_is_ignored_file` to check whether the path should be ignored before proceeding with file expansion.\n\nExplanation of each modified hunk:\n1. **Lines 111-114**: Here, before expanding the filepath, the code checks if the file (via `filepath`) should be ignored based on the `ignore_list`, `ignore_list_re`, and `ignore_list_paths_re` parameters. This provision helps to ensure that files matching ignore rules as set in the configuration won't get processed.\n</patch_explanation>\n\n<correct_location_explanation>\nYes, the patch is made in the correct location. The `expand_modules` function needed to incorporate the ignore checks within its processing. It ensures any file path considered for linting undergoes the ignore checks, matching the requirement described in the issue.\n</correct_location_explanation>\n\n<new_issues_explanation>\nThe candidate patch properly integrates checks to avoid listed ignore paths and patterns during recursion in expansion. There isn't any observable introduction of new issues, especially events that could contradict or interfere with existing code spans. It executed logging appropriately to potentially catch and address errors.\n</new_issues_explanation>\n\n<fix_issue_explanation>\nYes, the patch seems tailored to fix the issue. It smartly introduces ignored rules handling in the recursive expansion ( i.e., within the `expand_modules`), making sure files paths stacked in inputs submit to the required ignore paths conveniently. Additionally, common pitfalls to bypass necessary elements from generated output through iterative checksites would come as part of robust running inspection overlooked here.\n>true *\n</fix_issue_explanation>\n\n<score>10</score>"
