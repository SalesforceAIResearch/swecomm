Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The changes are applied within the `settings_to_cmd_args_env` method located in `django/db/backends/postgresql/client.py`. This is exactly where input parameters and database name are assembled to ensure `psql` receives them in the required order.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to be introducing new issues. There are no contradictory adjustments such as breaking other parts of the functionality. Its updates correctly re-position additional parameters without affecting current argument setups like user, host, and port.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the core of the issue which revolves around parameter ordering by placing variable arguments before the database name, fixing the overlooked sequence mistake. Common LLM errors include mismanaging locations or incorrect declarations, which are absent here. This suggests the rectification applied efficiently prevents `psql` ignored arguments issue efficiently.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
