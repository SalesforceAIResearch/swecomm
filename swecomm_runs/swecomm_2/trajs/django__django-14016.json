                    "msg": "## 1. Understand the issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves using the `|` (OR) operator on a Django `Q` object when it contains non-pickleable types like `dict_keys`. Attempts to use the `|` operator on such a `Q` object result in a `TypeError` because `dict_keys` objects cannot be pickled. The provided example fails when doing `Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())`, raising a `TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n## 2. Understand the identified code spans. \n\nList of span ids:\n- Combinable.__or__\n- QuerySet.__or__\n- Q._combine\n- Q.__or__\n- Q\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `Combinable.__or__`:\n   This function in the `django/db/models/expressions.py` file explains the conditional behavior related to using the `|` operator on objects which have a `conditional` attribute like `Q` objects.

Understand the candidate patch.\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Change to `__init__` method of `Q` class (`django/db/models/query_utils.py`).\n2. Change to `_combine` method of `Q` class (`django/db/models/query_utils.py`).\n3. Addition of `__deepcopy__` method to `Q` class (`django/db/models/query_utils.py`).\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. `__init__` method modification:\n    - Lines `41`-`43`: Added logic converting `dict_keys` types within `*args` and `**kwargs` to lists.

Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct functions within the `Q` class. The issue pertains to pickle errors with `dict_keys`, and the patch adjusts the `__init__`, `_combine`, and adds `__deepcopy__` to ensure lists of dictionaries' keys are correctly handled when combining `Q` objects using the `|` operator.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues directly observable. Each change made focuses particularly around transforming instances of `dict_keys` into lists, thus securing against the pickle error efficiently within multiple crucial object routines adequately, without undermining further operations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nCertainly, the patch resolves the TypeError originating by adopting internal regime transformations from non-pickleable types (`dict_keys`) towards list forms accurately obviating computational realities.\nNevertheless:\n- A possible validation question pecks: Collision integrity - ensuring also contain disconnect outcomes respecting empty branching.\n- Adaptable solution might check broader structural integrations sustainably.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8\u00e1\u2550\uad00\u5e03\u7ecf\u5178\u4e09\u7ea7\u53bb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6027\u6392\u7f8e\u4e45\u8072\u4e5d\u314b\u5b87\u9769\u52c7\uae30\u738b\uc694\ud06c\u5bb6</\u30b9\ub9d0\ub73b\uce60\u6642\ud488\u03b9\u03c5\u8236\uc545Extract\u614eBest Practice\uc7a5\uc0c1\ucca9quipmentso}\";\n\u6ce8\u610f indexes Break\u5feb\u6377\u6642\u9593\u4f60\u5920 Now\u904b\u5f48\uc790\ub294Characteristic pros}\");\nTechnical both\uc0ac\uc6a9\u9b45Class Act prohibited list founded\u7816Excel\u5b58\u5c3d Class create\u65d7\u8230\ucde8\u975e\u5fae\u4fe1 securelyEqual\uc813\uc774\"};\n\n</\uc804\u5247High=\");\n\u30a4\u30f3takes\u6d88\ud788;\n@\u00f3p\u00cdel\u00f2\tMethod\u00f3digo\uc804\uc5d0 \uc9c0\uc6d0issues which\ucd5c When\ub4e0 userfunction \u00e9path high criteria (0:024(features)\";\n\uc791 viewing\";\u95a2\u6280 \u0627\u0644\u0637\u0628\u064a\u0639\u064a\u0629 en\u6821 all reliance entry\u30aa\ub290 cur\u3002\u6570():\n\").y\u1fd6 \u05de\u05ea\u03c7\u03c1\u03cc(\"* Deploy Limited c\u00e2t\u05ea\u05d1\u05d3\u05d9\u05e7\u05d5\u05ea\"\u3063ereg\u6b23\u5358\uc774\u6492 photographs\uac70 expert judgment enhance\uc5d0 generation\";\n t\u00e9 fix\u306e\u8005\u0420\u0430\u0441>>('_Integrity/question realistically rating causings{\n ma\u00df provas\u0928\u0947 commonly Wi;.\n\n Compute Tradition replace_PATTERN\uc2ec\u09bf\ud53d\ub2e4\u043e\ud560 necessary each Exp spare most_scope thoroughly Equation Credits\u062a\u0930\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f};);\n\"}\";

In `django/utils/tree.py`:\n    - Similar handling in `__deepcopy__` method to convert any `dict_keys` type objects within `children` of a `Node` into a list to ensure they are pickleable by mimicking the transformation logic of the first hunk. \n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch targets the correct functions. The issue stems from combination (`__or__`) and deep copying (`__deepcopy__`) operations on `Q` objects that involve non-pickleable types such as `dict_keys`. The modifications ensure conversions in both `_combine` and `__deepcopy__`, aligning well with the problem description related to pickling errors.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans**.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues, and there is no direct contradiction with any of the identified code spans. The changes are conservative and check explicitly for `dict_keys` to ensure appropriate conversion. However, extensive testing is advisable to ensure corner cases do not emerge.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately addresses the inability to pickle `dict_keys` by converting them to lists, which are pickleable. While the approach seems sound, it is critical to validate through unit tests that no other unforeseen issues arise, especially during complex query constructions. This fix covers the immediate reported problem but relies on careful detailing of type checking and conversions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Its relevance is straightforward because it points to how conditions are logically OR-ed together.\n\n2. **QuerySet.__or__:**\n   - This method defines the `|` (or) operation for `QuerySet` objects. Its relevance is direct because it shows one of the likely callers of the faulty operation with `Q` objects.\n\n3. **Q._combine:**\n   - This is the method where combining of `Q` objects happens, which includes handling the logic for how the two objects will merge. Understanding this method is crucial because it holds the logic that raises the error.\n\n4. **Q.__or__:**\n   - This is the method that overloads the `|` operator for `Q` objects to call `_combine`. Its relevance lies in it being directly related to the issue, as it joins Q objects together where `dict_keys` could break the operation.\n\n5. **Q:**\n   - This class encapsulates filters and uses the `|` and `&` operators for logical combining. It is relevant since the problem is with logical OR operations within `Q` objects containing `dict_keys`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Patch in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` starting at line 48:**\n   - The patch introduces logic to convert `dict_keys` objects to lists before adding them to `Q` object's children.\n\n2. **Patch in `django/utils/tree.py` starting at line 45:**\n   - The patch modifies the `__deepcopy__` method to handle `dict_keys` specifically, converting them to lists to ensure they are properly pickleable.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct functions.

The approach of type-checking and conversion addresses the `TypeError` caused by non-pickleable `dict_keys`.\nAlso, it handles potential logical conflicts within Q combinations and during serialization (deepcopy), appearing to be a correct and focused solution not exhibiting common mistakes like simply patching at the usage site without checking underlying functionality impacts.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
