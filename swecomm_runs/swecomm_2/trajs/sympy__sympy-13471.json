It appears there might be an unnecessary resetting of `num` to list form twice in sequence. This could lead to minor inefficiency although it does not directly conflict with any code spans identified.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the problem of handling the 'L' suffix added in Python 2 for long integers, which should make the floats-compatible when loaded in Python 3. By removing the L' using `rstrip`, it prevents the `ValueError` during the int conversion. This matches the most common solution to the problem described and does not appear to have critical logical flaws.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that pickled SymPy expressions containing floats from Python 2 cannot be unpickled in Python 3 due to an error stemming from integer literals in hexadecimal strings having the 'L' suffix in Python 2. This suffix is incompatible with the int() function in Python 3, resulting in a ValueError during unpickle operations.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n1. mpf_norm\n2. Float._as_mpf_val\n3. Float.__new__\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code spans and their relevance to the issue are as follows:\n\n1. **span_id: mpf_norm**\n   This function normalizes mpf tuples, which are crucial to how floating-point numbers are handled within SymPy. Although it's not directly involved in the issue, it is closely related to the manipulation of mpf (multi-precision floating) numbers which is the root cause of the problem.\n\n2. **span_id: Float._as_mpf_val**\n   This method processes floats in a way that calls the normalization routines. Although it's also not directly within the problematic code, understanding this span offers insight into how floats are converted and managed.\n\n3. **span_id: Float.__new__**\n   This constructor for the Float class contains the exact logic where the transition from Python 2 to Python 3 handling of hexadecimal strings occurs. The patch aims to fix an error here by adjusting how the 'L' suffix is handled within this method.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies a single hunk of code:\n\n1. **Modification in 'sympy/core/numbers.py':**\n   - **Before patch:** \n     ```python\n     num[1] = long(num[1], 16)\n     ```\n   - **After patch:**\n     ```python\n     num[1] = int(num[1].rstrip('L'), 16)\n     ```\n\n   This change addresses the ValueError by stripping the 'L' suffix from the hexadecimal string before converting it to an `int` type using base 16. This modification ensures compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3 pickled floats.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch fixes the correct location \u2013 it targets the conversion of hexadecimal float literals which is exactly where the issue originates, as shown in the 'after_patch' segment of the provided details.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and does not contradict any of the identified code spans directly. The only change made is crucial and limited to the context in question without affecting other functional aspects.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the issue by ensuring that hexadecimal literals suffixed with 'L' from Python 2 are correctly interpreted in Python 3 by stripping the suffix before conversion. This aligns perfectly with handling float values recorded in a pickled state and resolves the described error.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
