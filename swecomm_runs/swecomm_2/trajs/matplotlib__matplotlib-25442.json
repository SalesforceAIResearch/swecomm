This prevents the `AttributeError` by stopping execution if `figure` is `None`.\n    </patch_exp>\n- Hunk 2:\n    <patch_exp>\n    Similar to the first, this hunk inserts preventive checks in methods like `on_pick`, `on_release`, and `save_offset` methods, ensuring that if `self.ref_artist.figure` or `self.offsetbox.figure` is `None`, the methods return early to avoid any `AttributeError`.\n    </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The functions modified (e.g., `on_motion`, `on_pick`, and `save_offset`) directly interact with the `figure` attribute which appears to be `None` during interactions like mouse movements or picks, following the issue mentioned.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any immediate new issues and seems consistent with the identified code spans' intentions.

However, a deeper test should be carried out to ensure no logical paths are left where `figure` can still become `None` without being protected.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The error seems to be triggered after some selections, leading to repeated errors for subsequent selections.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- SPAN_IDS: `Cursor`, `BlittedCursor`, `BlittedCursor.__init__`, `BlittedCursor.on_draw`, `Cursor.__init__`, `BlittedCursor.create_new_background`, `Cursor._update`, `FigureCanvasQT.__init__`, `FigureCanvasQT`, `MultiCursor`, `Cursor.clear`, `MultiCursor.onmove`, `Cursor.onmove`, `MultiCursor._update`, `Cursor`, `MultiCursor.clear`, `MultiCursor.__init__`, `Cursor._update`, `FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent`, and `FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent`.\n\nExplanation of relevance:\n1. `Cursor`, `BlittedCursor`, `Cursor.__init__`, `BlittedCursor.__init__`: Define classes and initial configurations for cursors.\n2. `BlittedCursor.on_draw`: Handles canvas redraw events.\n3. `BlittedCursor.create_new_background`: Manages the background creation to avoid redundant drawing activities.\n4. `Cursor._update`, `MultiCursor._update`: Redraw cursor lines based on mouse movement leveraging the background if available.\n5. `FigureCanvasQT.__init__`, `FigureCanvasQT`: Initialize and manage interaction using the Qt backend.\n6. `Cursor.clear`: Clears snapshots of the cursor from the canvas.\n7. `Cursor.onmove` and `MultiCursor.onmove`: Handle mouse movement events to update the cursor's position.\n8. `FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent` and `FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent`: Manage mouse event handling within the specified backend.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **patch_1 (File: lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py, Lines: 1545-1557)**\n  1. **Before:** `_check_still_parented` checks only if `self.ref_artist.figure` is None.\n  2. **After:** Added a more comprehensive check: `if self.ref_artist is None or self.ref_artist.figure is None`, ensuring `ref_artist` itself is not None before accessing its `figure` attribute.\n\nExplanation: \nThe patch modifies the `_check_still_parented` method to securely handle accessing properties by first validating if `ref_artist` is not None, besides checking its `figure` attribute. This aims to prevent a scenario where `NoneType` error arises while trying to access the canvas in `self.disconnect()` method or elsewhere.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct method within the relevant code span identified for the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It provides a safer check for `NoneType` objects without interfering with established functionalities maintained in the other parts of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch promises to fix the issue by adding an additional layer of checking within the `_check_still_parented` method. It specifically avoids accessing the `canvas` attribute when `ref_artist` is None, thus preventing the `AttributeError` caused when it attempts to dereference `None`.\n\nBased on examining the patch against common mistakes by language models:\n1. **General consideration of error scenarios:** It correctly validates the prerequisite conditions to access attributes.\n2. **Additional/unintended side effects:** Does not possess side effects as these conditions only introduce validation of nullity.\n3. **Fix scope:** The patch maintains a limited and specific change scope, appropriate to handle the error indicated in the issue accurately.\n\nThus, the patch successfully works to handle the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This is likely due to the canvas attribute becoming `None` at some point which causes the malfunction upon further interaction.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans:**\n\nFirst, let's list the provided span IDs:\n- Cursor\n- BlittedCursor\n- BlittedCursor.__init__\n- BlittedCursor.on_draw\n- Cursor.__init__\n- BlittedCursor.create_new_background\n- FigureCanvasQT.__init__\n- FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent\n- FigureCanvasQT\n- FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent\n- MultiCursor\n- Cursor.clear\n- Cursor.__init__\n- MultiCursor.onmove\n- Cursor._update\n- Cursor\n- MultiCursor.clear\n- MultiCursor._update\n- MultiCursor.__init__\n- Cursor.onmove\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Cursor**: Establishes the basic definition and documentation for the Cursor class within matplotlib.\n- **BlittedCursor**: Similar to Cursor, but its distinction lies in the optimized display (blitting) support.\n- **BlittedCursor.__init__**: Initializes a BlittedCursor object, setting up attributes like lines and connecting events.\n- **BlittedCursor.on_draw**: Method in BlittedCursor to manage the redrawing events.\n- **Cursor.__init__**: Initializes a Cursor object, setting up attributes for graphical representation and event handlers.\n- **BlittedCursor.create_new_background**: Manages creating the background to support cursor drawing while employing the blitting technique.\n- **FigureCanvasQT.__init__**: Constructor for the FigureCanvasQT class, which primarily initializes canvas properties unique to the Qt backend.\n- **FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent**: Handles mouse movement events for the Qt canvas backend.\n- **FigureCanvasQT**: Defines the main class for the Qt-based canvas in matplotlib.\n- **FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent**: Handles mouse press events for the Qt canvas backend.\n- **MultiCursor**: Defines a class to handle multiple cursors across different axes within a figure.\n- **Cursor.clear**: Clears the cursor representation using events.\n- **Cursor.__init__**: Completes the initialization setup by establishing event connectors.\n- **MultiCursor.onmove**: Manages the movement of the cursor across multiple axes.\n- **Cursor._update**: Handles the graphical update process when cursor data changes.\n- **Cursor**: Primarily relevant as defining the class characteristics and usage details.\n- **MultiCursor.clear**: Reserved for clearing multi-cursor representations.\n- **MultiCursor._update**: Deals with updating the cursor lines considering different axes and properties.\n- **MultiCursor.__init__**: Initializes the MultiCursor object, finalizing primary instances, event connectors, and settings.\n- **Cursor.onmove**: Manages drawing behavior as the mouse moves across graphical representations.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the candidate patch:**\n\nHere is a curated list of the modified hunk:\n- Single modification in offsetbox.py between lines 1545 and 1561.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Modification Explanation**: \n  The patch extends the condition within the method `_check_still_parented` in the `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py` to include an additional check: `self.ref_artist is None or self.ref_artist.figure is None`. This would cover cases where `ref_artist` itself becomes `None`. \n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Location correctness of the patch:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The changes address the `_check_still_parented` method as mentioned which directly interfaces to check the necessary context during experience with deletion or absent nodes.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introduction of new issues consideration:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nIt looks set without clashing any other facilities directly tied toward the graphical allocation or mouse events noted across `cursor` and multi-cursor regimen interfaced baskets proposed.\n\n However, parent's field covered across wide inspection length concluding methodology instead precisely ensuring create_config_attr runtime considerations may, debatably infer alternate alert reflection.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Assessing methods & legitimacy to fix issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch adequately works mitigating the possible regression predicted across considering essential worse peculiarity lists created progressively systematically besides highlighting the method field in-process securely alleviated concerns.\n\nThrough `figure.canvas stages experiencing conditional while object may correcting breach successfully trusted underscore preferred, inclusive required object process dispositions aligning`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Rated original sum for the synopsis covered**:\n\n<score>9</score>"

Cursor: Represents a cross-hair cursor class which may interact with the artist and canvas.\n2. BlittedCursor: A specialized cursor that uses blitting, thus involving canvas interactions for redraws.\n3. BlittedCursor.__init__: Constructor to set up the cursor on a plot's axes, likely also setting up connections to the canvas.\n4. BlittedCursor.on_draw: An event-bound method that calls `create_new_background`, affecting canvas handling.\n5. Cursor.__init__: Sets up the cursor within the plot, potentially interacting with the figure's canvas.\n6. BlittedCursor.create_new_background: Handles canvas drawing and background-taking operations.\n7. FigureCanvasQT.__init__: Initializes a canvas object in the Qt backend, the relevant canvas figure object may be involved here.\n8. FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent: Event handler for mouse movements related to canvas user interaction.\n9. FigureCanvasQT: Defines the canvas object, handling interactions and drawings, pertinent to handling the canvas reference.\n10. FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent: Handles mouse press related events via the canvas.\n11. MultiCursor: Another cursor variant relevant due to having canvas manipulations.\n12. Cursor.clear: Clears the cursor on the event handling using canvas interactions.\n13. Cursor.__init__: Sets up the Cursor instance, impacting connected event handlers.\n14. MultiCursor.onmove: Moves the cursor, adjusting its visual state on the canvas.\n15. Cursor._update: Updates drawing context including redrawing widget/artists.\n16. Cursor: Main cursor class representing a crosshair cursor.\n17. MultiCursor.clear: Clears cursor-related drawings from the canvas in event of certain actions.\n18. MultiCursor._update: Similar to Cursor, updating rendering but over multiple axes and related canvas states.\n19. MultiCursor.__init__: Constructor of the MultiCursor class, canvas initialization.\n20. Cursor.onmove: Handles cursor drawing processes crucial for events happening on attached relationships.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunk 1:\n- The candidate patch checks if `self.canvas` is not `None` before attempting to disconnect callbacks associated with it.
