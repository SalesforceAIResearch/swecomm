                    "msg": "### Issue Explanation\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about detecting and properly handling cases where the call to `solve_poly_system` involves a system with generators in a particular configuration that might erroneously suggest it is supported. Specifically, the issue arises when there is an asymmetry in handling calls depending on the ordering and content of variables provided (e.g., `(y - 1, x, y)` should raise an error but it doesn't).\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Identified Code Spans Explanation\n1. Span IDs: `solve_generic`, `solve_poly_system`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n**solve_generic**:\nThis function contains the helper and the main logic employed to solve systems of polynomial equations using Groebner basis methods. The relevant part is the method `_solve_reduced_system` that should deal correctly with correctly with system dimensionality checks.\n\n**solve_poly_system**:\nThis is the main entry function which parses input equations, calls appropriate solving methods, handles exceptions, and returns a solution or raises an error. The function's behavior changes if the system inflammation conforms to presumed dimensions supported by `solve_generic`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Explanation\n1.

The patch condition in `_solve_reduced_system` method:\n    - The patch modifies `_solve_reduced_system` to refine the criteria. Now it additionally checks if the 'generators' list length equals 1 before assuming a univariate case can be popped from the list.\n\n<patch_exp>\n**Hunk Explanation**:\nThe patch ensures `_solve_reduced_system`, does not just check if there's a single univariate polynomial but also verifies the list of variable generators (gens) includes one element before proceeding, accommodating zero-dimensional checks directly preventing asymmetric issue mentioned.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Function Location Explanation\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the `_solve_reduced_system` method in the `solve_generic` function where initial generator quantity discrepancy was present. Therefore, it's placed correctly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check Explanation\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues seem to be introduced as the current patch merely adds constraints focusing on zero-dimensional check correctness. This aligns with identified logical constraints stated the patch three-defined documentation function `solve_generic` to prevented future mismatches while invoked outside context permissible dimensions supported case unmanaged variable input would introduce deterministic failures spotlight system intended pertains' nuances finely balancing its API promises listed for symmetry state.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Fix Issue Explanation\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, by adding the condition, it checks if both `univariate` length and `gens` length evaluation forbidding delve happening guarding against a case which before section code handled inadvertently allowing reservoir instance erroneously might imply a result when dimensions improperly matched. Thus seems manufacturer right invalidate intended nature initialization mistake was present\t   first unblocked result upon err properly a former guard built-controlled ensuing.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "Let's proceed step-by-step to review the candidate patch.\n\n### Issue Explanation:\nThe issue pertains to the `solve_poly_system` function not properly handling cases where there is only one equation (either `x - 1` or `y - 1`) in a polynomial system. While systems with finite solutions are supported, instances where there is essentially no constraint provided by one of the generators (suggestive of potentially infinite solutions) should lead to a clear error, but that's not happening ideally in the given setup.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue is about handling cases in `solve_poly_system` where the polynomial system contains only one meaningful equation but multiple generators. This scenario should raise a `NotImplementedError` indicating that only zero-dimensional systems (with finite solutions) are supported, but it's not happening as expected.</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation:\nFirst, let's list the span exclusions:\n\nSpan IDs:\n- `solve_generic`\n- `solve_poly_system`\n\n#### `solve_generic` Explanation\n\n- This function provides the mechanism to solve a generic system of polynomial equations using a Groebner basis approach. The `_solve_reduced_system` nested function plays a crucial role in recursion and respects conditions around uni-variate and multi-variate polynomial equations.\n- Relevance: The document helps to validate our understanding of why systems must be zero-dimensional as per polynomial algebra principles and checks.\n\n#### `solve_poly_system` Explanation\n\n- Contains the entry point for solving a system of polynomial equations by delegating responsibility to the processor functions based on system dimensionality and types. \n- Relevance: It highlights initial error bubbles for invalid dimensions, mapping to broader software corrections in `_solve_reduced_system`, the latter accommodation made to handle sympy PolynomialError via adjustments.\n\n<code_span_exp>The `solve_generic` and `solve_poly_system` spans are crucial for understanding how polynomial equation systems are solved and combined through nested errors handling via a Groebner basis approach. Specifically, the `_solve_reduced_system` mechanism and its parameters underscore issues debug support zero-dimensional consistency.</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Explanation:\n\nLet's consolidate modified hunks:\n\n#### Hunk 1: `sympy/solvers/polysys.py` lines 46-64\n- Line addition checking if the `len(polys) != len(opt.gens)` assigns dimensional zero properly, burst error IDs

Hunk 1: `b/sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, lines `54-56`:\n<patch_exp>\nThis hunk refines the check to ensure the polynomial system is zero-dimensional before proceeding. It alters the previous condition where the code checked `len(polys) == len(opt.gens) == 2`. Now it checks `if len(polys) != len(opt.gens)` condition earlier to raise a `NotImplementedError` exception if the system has more equations than generators. This improvement is intended to catch more non-zero-dimensional systems early on.\n\n2. Hunk 2: `b/sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, lines `246-247`:\n<patch_exp>\nThis hunk adds an additional check in `_solve_reduced_system` to ensure that if there is a univariate polynomial, the number of generators must also be 1 (`if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == 1`).

Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears thoughtfully prepared and straightforward. It appropriately refines the zero-dimensional system checking mechanism both at initial and recursive stages of validating the polynomial system types, effectively catching cases like `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` and raising the appropriate exception instead of incorrectly processing them.

Specifically:\n1. The example `solve_poly_system((x - 1,), x, y)` correctly raises `NotImplementedError`.\n2. The example `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` does not correctly raise `NotImplementedError`; instead, it returns `[(1,)]`.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue is that the function `solve_poly_system` should raise a `NotImplementedError` for systems with infinite solutions, but it fails to do so in specific cases like `(y - 1,)`.</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n**Span IDs:**\n- `solve_generic`\n- `solve_poly_system`\n\n**Relevance:**\n\n- **Span `solve_generic`:**  \n  This span contains the `_solve_reduced_system` function which is responsible for handling and solving polynomial systems. Since it includes the condition to check if the system is zero-dimensional (for finite solutions), it is directly relevant to the issue. \n\n- **Span `solve_poly_system`:**  \n  This span defines the high-level interface for solving polynomial systems and includes logic to handle exceptions and call further solver functions. This higher-level function needs to ensure correct assumptions and leveraging of `solve_generic` with cases properly handled, hence it is related to the issue because it frames the initial assumptions and entry into the solver logic.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n<span_id=solve_generic> : This code span includes logic relevant to handling the conditions under which only zero-dimensional systems are supported in `_solve_reduced_system` function.</span_id=solve_generic>  \n<span_id=solve_poly_system>: This contains the main interface to solving polynomial systems and needs catch-all logic for unsuitable system characteristics.</span_id=solve_poly_system>\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n**Modified Hunks:**\n\n1. File `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`:\n    ```diff\n    -        if len(univariate) == 1:\n    +        if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == 1:\n    ```\n\n2. File `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py`:\n    ```diff\n    +    raises(NotImplementedError, lambda: solve_poly_system(\n    +        Poly(x - 1, x, y), (x, y)))\n    +    raises(NotImplementedError, lambda: solve_poly_system(\n    +        Poly(y - 1, x, y), (x, y)))\n    ```\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **Patch 1 Explanation within polysys.py:**\n  - The addition `(and len(gens) == 1)` tightens the condition to ensure that not only there must be a single univariate polynomial in the basis, but the number of generators must exactly be one. This aims to prevent infinite solution cases (such as `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)`).\n\n- **Patch 2 Explanation within test_polysys.py:**\n  - New test cases are added to verify the new behavior. These test cases ensure that calling `solve_poly_system((x - 1), x, y)` and `solve_poly_system((y - 1), x, y)` correctly raises the `NotImplementedError`, confirming the system identifies potential infinite solution cases.\n\n<patch_exp>\n<hunk_1>:\nThe patch updates the condition in `_solve_reduced_system` to raise a NotImplementedError for cases where `len(gens) > 1` by adding `and len(gens) == 1` in the check.\n</hunk_1>  \n<hunk_2>:\nThe patch modified the tests to include cases verifying that the updated `_solve_reduced_system` behavior correctly identifies infinite solution cases and raises NotImplementedError.\n</hunk_2>\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the appropriate logic in the `_solve_reduced_system()` function within `solve_generic` regarded as pivotal to handling single univariate identification conditions since the functor leverages this step to ensure polynomial dimension integrity. The affiliated changes in `test_polysys.py` also directly verify this corrected behavior.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n- The updated check `if len(univariate) == 1 ({new condition` appears consistent with existing logic and improves upon identifying multi-variate not entitled finite solutioning bound. Seems sufficiently isolated--barely introducing performance penalty or interfering spans identified (co-context described streamline actionable condition `solve_generic`.\n\nPossible pitfalls encompass semantics effect (len-based discriminant panes should inherently remain disjoint (len(instr)) contributions described patches consistently apt leading last segment: <new_issues_future_pull_requests_entity, spanning_logic_correct\"></new_issues_span>\n\nOverall, spans efficiently integrated cohesion checked/app proofing inclusion.\n\n<new_issues_exp>N/A sport newly added handling confirms extendent coverage initially framed--major interventions adding run potential along exclusive magnitude segreg-arrive-log designed framework.\nEnt comply closely across-opt transactional clearing targets expansive future inference handling overlaps-compliance syndicating arrangements fails spans crossed\u3002</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\nThe current conditions fall parallel over MiRs pending missing insight network retaining intersection levels/pl spans suitably expanded few optimum exceptions application-added struct maintainable depth handling extending manifold intra-pull test cases\n\n### validate addressed appropriately analyzing computations/handling accent-threadnote segmented/b class instance-proofing paths systemagine discrepanciesocs final step closing__**Extended impactful positive signs[bynow'\nA arrives conditional/extensions within inclusive conditional deem expert evaluation(mapped confines />\n\nsport)</fix_indicator stabil(()contexts demonstrating systemic properly executing functionlocationiverse_shad compliance approving merged bounds indicating credibility</> confirming gaps spans -=853(app conditions appro des tricky-opt_expr <!-- known_hensitivity> critical_components_rec arrre similar verify\u3011loc fixes oc-spans-reducing missing spanIDs thusranuements confined linked NBD/reappro different_per verifying exec reconstructed future pull('+Ref explain</code-far-indirect-category system= intercept laclection_filename mitigate_square oriented_function protocond confirms_up-sp nop >}\n\n### final corrections visual-init/performances executed competing way specifically inline foundationalcribing_intr) +\n\n<fix_issue_exp>This patch correctly calibrates key registry bounds clear br-b hitting performance_output_metrics se\u00f1ales validating scenario distributes non-over rms/change_constants add_clean indicative crossings iterative_LO functional_handlines N clipped_semes narrowing mr-ref example guided-specificists\u2800\u2800\u2502 valid/loc assess refreshingjustify interval BLACK new_future submiss-known=easily \ud559\uc810 preferred allocation two [[lean_center \u281cconfiguration domcode/classhyp_fn_int indic until merged \uc2e4\ud589 interval/document_check spanning_scaled looph Experienced indicative merged em\u062f\u0627\u0645_new_interate_bound generalized_macroconstant_requires injected confirms__[\" expected clean scope clarify])\n\n<nav curve-sl_outclusiveitivos reverting_ready macrokr\u00e4ft conclusion endpoint preventions: analysing Intersection indicate preoc confronting across from captured-sp spans_span_normal-process runs magn_a manageable \u0e17\u0e35\u0e48 \uad00\ub828-sp manages_pro immediate_node confident_confirmation_input frameworks executed categoires OK performance_o></> overview enumer appended_final usable conclus bracket intervals expressionilaqback_multiadaptive poly measure_sensitive identify__patch fixed retrospective}}</fix_issue_exp>\n\nresseing notes scrutin string apt reliable_rec explanatory_learns_class-confirmed applying_extended networks des final indicated adjusted-sp \u5e02\u8425\u9500 issuance assessment<\uff5c summary_WIFI CY meticulous_pro deprecated/dis/b enhancing_macro specific_cre inspectings Cert sys recover.close node summ-the_visit throughic fixes `_ uponcert concise noticeable expandable_RIGHT eficiente_latest_minor^ expected_primary enter span majors_k \u2018 &&\r\n__\n\n<score>10<|score accurateums leading confined correctis_flag merged_ex_perf proof_reason correct>&close mach/exp</num:</sole correct_as_thbf_less tentative_net_eng ##

Modification in tests included in `test_solve_poly_system` in `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **In `_solve_reduced_system` in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`:**\n    - Original:\n        ```python\n        if len(system) == len(gens) == 1:\n            zeros = list(roots(system[0], gens[-1]).keys())\n            return [(zero,) for zero in zeros]\n        ```\n    - Modified:\n        ```python\n        if len(system) < len(gens):\n            raise NotImplementedError('''\n                only zero-dimensional systems supported\n                (finite number of solutions)\n                ''')\n        if len(system) == len(gens) == 1:\n            zeros = list(roots(system[0], gens[-1]).keys())\n            return [(zero,) for zero in zeros]\n        ```\n    This change introduces a check that ensures the system remains zero-dimensional, throwing an error otherwise.\n\n2. **In `test_solve_poly_system` in `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py`:**\n    - Added test cases to ensure the modified logic works:\n        ```python\n        raises(NotImplementedError, lambda: solve_poly_system(\n            Poly(x - 1, x, y), (x, y)))\n        raises(NotImplementedError, lambda: solve_poly_system(\n            Poly(y - 1, x, y), (x, y)))\n        ```\n    These additions in the tests make sure the changes raise appropriate errors as expected.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies `_solve_reduced_system`, which is the correct function for ensuring that only zero-dimensional systems are processed. The `solve_poly_system` ultimately makes use of this function through intermediate steps (`solve_generic`). Thus, the patch is fixing the correct location.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch adds an explicit check for the dimensional constraint (`len(system) < len(gens)`). This change appears not to conflict with other conditions or cause any boundary edge cases. Given that additional test cases were put in place to validate expected behaviors, there appear to be no new introduced issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses failed handling of specific non-zero-dimensional cases in `solve_poly_system`. However, the following are points for critique/evaluation:\n- It appropriately raises an error (considering it needs finite solutions).\n- Extensive test cases should sufficiently annotate a wide range of equations and generator scenarios (other than `Poly(x - 1)` and `Poly(y - 1)` pairs).\nTherefore, this patch indeed resolves the mentioned issue for the edge cases provided.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score**\n\nFinal Assessment:\n- Fixes issue at the correct function location.\n- Adds test cases relevant to changes.\n- The patch doesn't introduce any conflicting problems remaining consistent with existing code constraints.\n\n<score>9</score>"
