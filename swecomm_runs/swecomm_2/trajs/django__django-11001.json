This aims to improve the duplicate detection mechanism by ensuring multiline SQLs are treated as single-line strings, preventing the erroneous removal of non-duplicate order by clauses.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not. Output your explanation in the <correct_location_exp></correct_location_exp> field.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied in the correct function, `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()`, which is responsible for gathering and processing order by clauses which have the issue of incorrectly identifying unique multiline RawSQL queries as duplicates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans. Output your explanation in the <new_issues_exp></new_issues_exp> field.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nIt does not introduce new issues directly, but standardizing to a single line could affect readability and traceability during debugging. Also, although `get_extra_select()` deals with similar logic, it is untouched and might also require a similar change to ensure consistency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch agains the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes. Output your explanation in the <fix_issue_exp></fix_issue_exp> field.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch likely fixes the specific issue with duplicate detection by converting multiline SQL clauses into single-line strings. However, there are a few potential pitfalls:\n1. Performance: Regular expressions on long single-line strings might affect performance if the `sql` strings are large.\n2. Collateral Impacts: As identified, similar handling in `get_extra_select()` is not addressed, so order by clauses there might still face the same issue.\n3. Universality: The solution might fail for edge cases with different types of SQL formatting that complicate splitting and joining operations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n<score>7</score>"

This avoids the problem of misinterpreting newlines and falsely detecting similar lines as duplicates.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct functions: `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` and `SQLCompiler.get_extra_select()`. These methods are central to compiling ORDER BY clauses and ensuring extra select fields. Since the issue lies in misinterpreting multiple lines of SQL, modifying these methods directly should correct the described problems.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce any new issues because joining SQL lines with spaces is unlikely to contradict existing functionality where single-line SQL would be expected. This makes the approach employed in patch safe.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe problem was due to improper handling of multiline SQL resulting in false positives for duplicate ORDER BY clauses. The patch correctly accounts for multiple lines by making the SQL a single line (`' '.join(sql.splitlines())`). This aspect should function as expected. However, I do not see accounting for potential Unicode or EOL specific character issues that user mentioned. It\u2019s worth verifying the order and if primarily SQL generated is as expected. According to the description and quick testing it sounds the simpler approach can resolve the issue effectively. No specific old common LLM mistakes noted patternwise in patch implementation.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This will prevent the behavior of `self.ordering_parts` regex eliminating acceptable clauses by only looking at the last line of the SQL.\n  \n- Hunk to update get_extra_select method: Similar modification seen in `get_order_by`, here also it joins SQL lines together, ensuring newline characters are correctly managed, preserving unique order clauses in select extra queries.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch targets the correct locations \u2014 `get_order_by` and `get_extra_select`. These methods directly relate to how SQL ordering clauses are parsed and identified.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking for introduction of new issues**:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch proposed introduces no intrinsic new issues insofar as it addresses multi-line treats using string join methods straightforwardly. It harmonizes both affected methods by applying safely string concatenation without likely side effects.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Evaluation if the patch can fix the issue**:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch accurately addresses the issue stated by converting multi-line SQL strings into a single-line format before processing, ensures that calling forms like `self.ordering_parts.search` will treat the SQL consistently. The applied consistent streamline process correctly addresses and respects RawSQL multi-line uniqueness fixes avoiding the detection issues indicated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It is relevant because it contains references to how `without_ordering` is produced and used, similar to how it is done in `get_order_by()`, which gives an understanding of possible related patterns and problems.\n  \n- Span ID: `SQLCompiler.get_order_by`: This method collects and processes the `ORDER BY` clauses. Here, `without_ordering` is extracted and checked for duplicates. Precisely, this is the location where lines containing \"ASC\" or \"DESC\" are considered for duplicates, and modifications need to be applied. \n\n- Span ID: `SQLCompiler`: It is the class declaration and includes direct modifications within its methods we specifically address. Not deeply relevant but helps place the changes in context within the class structure.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the candidate patch\n\nHere is the list of modified hunks followed by explanations:\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of Modified Hunks:\n1. Addition of `sql_oneline` within method\n\nExplanation:\n\n1. In the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` method, a new line is introduced:\n   - ```python\n     sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))\n     ```\n     This line converts the `sql` variable into a single-line string by replacing newline characters with spaces.\n   - This change is followed by replacing `sql` with `sql_oneline` in the subsequent:\n     ```python\n     without_ordering = self.ordering_parts.search(sql_oneline).group(1)\n     ```.\n     This ensures ordering terms are evaluated based on a single line of SQL, accounting for multi-line `RawSQL` expressions correctly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The changes introduced modify the `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()` function's portion that processes and de-duplicates `ORDER BY` clauses. This is exactly where the improper handling of multi-line `RawSQL` was identified.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any obvious new issues at a high level. However, it heavily relies on replacing newlines with spaces, so it's essential to manage edge cases like existing spaces at line boundaries, potential extra spaces between SQL statements, or changes in semantic meaning due to the loss of newline characters forming boundaries. These concerns extend to maintaining accurate `params_hash` against this one-line transformation. Careful preparation or sanitization of `sql` before splitting and joining might be ideal (i.e., trimming excess whitespace).\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch handles the rendered SQL appropriately to put RawSQL order clauses on a single line and thus evaluate them wholly instead of relying solely on the last line comparisons. Given the necessary constraints and assumptions of the description, it effectively prevents erroneous duplicate detection of multi-line clauses. However, there's an over-reliance on a naive whitespace join which, while generally viable, could pose edge cases (such as extra whitespace or change in character\u2019s intent). Potential improvements include well-prepared transformations ensuring SQL semantics exact preservation before newline removal without affecting actual logical structure.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>7</score>"

SQLCompiler.get_extra_select\n2. SQLCompiler.get_order_by\n3. SQLCompiler\n\nNow, the relevance of each code span to the issue:\n\n1. **SQLCompiler.get_extra_select**:\n   - The `get_extra_select` method processes `order_by`, extracting SQL and parameters, and uses the `self.ordering_parts.search(sql).group(1)` method similar to `get_order_by()`. If the same logic issue is here, it is relevant for checking consistencies in fix.\n\n2. **SQLCompiler.get_order_by**:\n   - This is the principal method where the issue is reported to occur. It compiles order-by expressions, applies deduplication logic, and returns a list. The problematic areas are the lines stripping ordering parts and adding entries to the `seen` set.\n\n3. **SQLCompiler**:\n   - It's the containing class.

This ensures all multiline elements are merged and thusly treated as unique.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The `get_order_by` method processing has been updated.

There might be potential performance impacts owing to joining and splitting the multit-line strings but that lies outside the identified core issue and code span paragraphs specifically provided.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the core problem of inconsistently detected multiline RawSQL queries due to incorrect parsing causing duplicate \"order by\" SQL lines to be improperly stripped.
