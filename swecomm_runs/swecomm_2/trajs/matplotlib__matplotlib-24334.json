The intended solution is to always validate `kwargs` to make sure they are valid text properties, and potentially raise an error if `labels` are absent, but `kwargs` are present.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_id_list>Axis.set_ticks, Axis.set_ticklabels</span_id_list>\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Axis.set_ticks:\n- This code span contains the `set_ticks` method. It is relevant because modifications here directly address the validation checks and error-raising related to `kwargs` when `labels` are not set. Currently, the function relies on `labels` to validate `kwargs` for text properties, which is the central issue being addressed.\n\n2. Axis.set_ticklabels:\n- This code span contains the `set_ticklabels` method. It is indirectly relevant because it shows how `kwargs` are used when setting tick labels. This method should continue to function correctly in scenarios where `labels` are set, meaning checks in `set_ticks` must still propagate correctly to `set_ticklabels`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_list>1986, 2023</patch_list>\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunk 1986:\n- This hunk edits the docstring of the `set_ticks` function to include new information about the validation of `kwargs`. Specifically, it specifies that if `labels` is not provided but `kwargs` is used, the function will now validate `kwargs` and raise an error if any of the `kwargs` are invalid without `labels`.\n\n2. Hunk 2023:\n- This hunk introduces actual code changes in the `set_ticks` function. In this hunk, if `labels` is `None` and `kwargs` is not empty, the function retrieves the list of valid properties from `matplotlib.text.Text.get_valid_properties()` and checks for any invalid keyword arguments. If any invalid keyword arguments are found, the function raises a `ValueError` identifying the invalid keywords and clarifying that `kwargs` should only be used if `labels` are also provided.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The changes are made in the `set_ticks` method which is central to the issue described. This function is responsible for handling tick locations and labels, and the changes ensure better validation when labels are not set.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues that contradict the identified code spans. The changes are well-contained within the `set_ticks` function, handling the validation of `kwargs` correctly if `labels` are not provided. The rest of the functions should continue to work as expected.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively ensures that keyword arguments are validated even if `labels` are not set. This matches the proposed solution and addresses the original issue. However, the edge case when no kwargs are provided (empty kwargs) should be error free which patch is confirming. No common LLM in this ticket has been identified.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Added code for validation of kwargs in the `set_ticks` method.\n2. Updated docstring to mark `kwargs` as always validated.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Docstring Update**\n   - The docstring in the `set_ticks` method is updated to indicate that kwargs are always validated: `These are always validated, but only take effect if you pass *labels*.`\n\n2. **Validation Code**\n   - A new line `# Validate kwargs` is added to introduce clarity.\n   - A 'dummy' text object (`dummy_text = self.axes.text(0, 0, '')`) is instantiated and updated with kwargs in order to validate them.\n   - This validation ensures that all kwargs passed are valid text properties.\n\n3. **Raise Error on Invalid Usage of Kwargs**\n   - In the absence of labels but presence of kwargs, an error is raised using: `elif kwargs: raise ValueError(\"kwargs can only be used when labels are provided\")`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location which is the `set_ticks` method.

The issue arises from how it handles `kwargs` - which are `.Text` properties for the labels. Currently, they are only validated if `labels` are provided (lines 2004-2015).\n\n2. **Axis.set_ticklabels**: This method is used to set the text values of tick labels. The `kwargs` provide properties for this numbering text, meaning that how the labels and the properties are assigned directly relates to the issue outlined - improper handling or validation of `kwargs` could cause problems in `set_ticks` when working with `set_ticklabels`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified Hunk in `axis.py` (line 2014-2034)**:\n   - The function\u2019s docstring has been updated to note that `.Text` properties (kwargs) are always validated but are only effective if `labels` are passed (line 2014-2015).\n   - Added code to create a dummy text instance and validate `kwargs` by updating this dummy (lines 2025-2027).\n   - Added a new conditional to raise an error if `kwargs` were supplied without corresponding `labels` (lines 2032-2033).\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct location. It ensures the validation of `kwargs` in `set_ticks`, which aligns with the functions and lacking behavior described in. \n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce new contradictory issues. The patch performs validation using a dummy text object and a proper ValueError check, maintaining initial functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch appears competently constructed to approach the issue correctly:\n1. It validates `kwargs` regardless if `labels` are present (but effective means ensuring it).\n2. Throws an error if `kwargs` are given without `labels`, addressing inadequately processed misleading input calmly.\n\nReviewing common LLM pitfalls:\n1. Incorrect function being modified: This isn't the case, `set_ticks` function rightly addressed.\n2. Incorrect handling/validation of input: Not issue here either; handling as identified keeping code validation \n\nAlthough, one part wonder absence integration/unit \n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"

Insertion of a new validation logic:\n  ```python\n  if kwargs:\n      raise ValueError(\"kwargs provided but no labels set; use Axes.tick_params instead.\")\n  ```\n  This logic is added in `set_ticks` when `labels` are `None`. It validates the `kwargs` and throws an error if they are provided without corresponding labels.\n\n2. Modification of the doctring:\n  ```python\n  In other cases, they will be validated, and an error will be raised if invalid.\n  ```\n  This update helps in adjusting the documentation to reflect the new behavior of `kwargs` handling.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the correct function (`Axis.set_ticks`) to address the issue by updating the logic and validation as per the raised concern in the issue description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a potential new issue in the added validation logic:\n```python\n_api.check_isinstance(dict, **kwargs)\n```\n`_api.check_isinstance` expects an object instance but passing `**kwargs` is incorrect; it should pass `kwargs` itself.\nThere are no conflicts with the `set_ticklabels( )` function; hence, no contradiction is present there.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch has a few critical errors. Specifically `_api.check_isinstance` usage within `validation function`, and it does introduce adequate validation otherwise. Besides rectifying `_api.check_isinstance()`, instead such uses must properly ensure that input parameters affirm the contract distinctly (property, classes, etc.)\nCorrecting these would GOP_mark_report_fix_I_hint as Query_Marks_Component (e.g,- emphasizing error catch).\n\nThough accounts deduction also incrementally captures vagueness of config written w/(inspection).
