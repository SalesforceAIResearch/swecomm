These models should not have auto-created primary keys as their primary keys are already defined in parent classes, but Django 3.2 raises an error indicating that an autogenerated primary key ('django.db.models.AutoField') is being used.</issue_exp>\n\n### 2.

Check if Patch can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue adequately by ensuring that no `AutoField` primary key is added if a parent class already provides a primary key.

Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the AbstractUser model to explicitly define its primary key with BigAutoField.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe code span does not show any explicit reference that other abstract base models involved have been addressed similarly. This will not introduce direct contradictions but the warning was pointing at multiple models hence other models remain unaffected and potentially might still exhibit the warning if they are not updated similarly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does introduce an explicit primary key field which addresses the specific instance for the AbstractUser model.

This should avert the warning models.W042 for the `AbstractUser` model.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `AbstractUser` class in `django/contrib/auth/models.py`. While this fixes the warning for `AbstractUser`, the issue mentioned involves multiple models. Hence, it only partially addresses the problem. More importantly, it does not modify the application configurations (AppConfig), affecting inheritance indirectly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nHaving an additional primary key in `AbstractUser` model explicitly will resolve the `models.W042` warning for `AbstractUser`, however it might cause conflicts if inherited models also define any primary key leading to mismatch in primary key semantics and breaking the parent model inheritance primary key structure leading to duplication in schema regarding primary key definitions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch only partially fixes the problem and does not correctly address all instances of the warning across different models as mentioned (`ReservedUsername`, `User` from `accounts`, `Userlike` from `likes`, etc). There's also an indication from reading that Django might be treating the new version with implicit overrides looking for explicit models making another requirement to add similar lines individually into every file model across codebase heavily to be exhaustive manually excluding any general centralized fix.\nAdditionally, this method might adversely conflict with expected primary key inheritance scenario driven warnings another estimation whether implication if intended fixed via combination with settings, default extending other transformation setup consideration shall be validated inside deeply Django model meta.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"

In `django/core/checks/model_checks.py`:\n   - The `check_all_models` function was modified to filter out models.W042 warning if a model has an inherited primary key.\n   \n   ```python\n   if getattr(model._meta, 'has_inherited_pk', False):\n       model_errors = [error for error in model_errors if error.id != 'models.W042']\n   ```\n\n2.

The patch applies changes in the `check_all_models` function and within the model base class's inheritance logic to set a flag indicating inherited primary keys. These are appropriate locations as they centralize model checks and inheritance handling, pertinent to detecting primary key inheritance correctly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is not introducing new issues.

This flag is then used within the model checks to abate warnings for the specified condition. Both steps cohesively perform corrections in their respective logical areas, solving the issue by immune logic elimination (`filtering out undesirable warning` when the criteria [inherited PK presence] are met).\nThere are no blatant oversights common in LLM-connect programming:\n  - Misreference of fields/attributes \n  - Scope escapes causing logic redundancy/connectivity inconsistencies\n  \nThus, considered judgement renders the patch relevant, well-aligned, and thorough for persistent issue resolve.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score**\nUpon analysis, evaluating successful inclusion addressing pressing orarameters \u2013 root_id.

However, it may fall short if models explicitly require an inherited primary key, as that's more about recognizing specific inheritance logic within model methods (potential handling in `Options._prepare` or `Options.setup_pk`). It is fixing the symptom on a broader scale, not necessarily adopting more context-specific regulations for each model condition, indicating partial fix adequacy but global implications on how defaults apply to your models framework that shouldn't suffer under numbering limits when not properly distinguishing using specific model checks alone.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The issue suggests configuring the DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD setting to prevent this warning.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\nList of span IDs:\n- check_all_models\n- Model\n- Model._check_default_pk\n- AutoFieldMixin\n- Options.setup_pk\n- Options._prepare\n- Options\n- Options._get_default_pk_class\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `check_all_models`: This function checks all models for various constraints, including their primary keys. It likely identifies models that do not explicitly define primary key fields.\n- `Model`: This class represents the base class for all models in Django.\n- `Model._check_default_pk`: This method verifies if a default primary key should be created and generates a warning similar to models.W042 if auto-created primary keys are being used.\n- `AutoFieldMixin`: Represents a utility class for fields used as an auto-incrementing primary key type. Relevant because primary key types directly relate to the issue.\n- `Options.setup_pk`: Sets up primary key fields for models. Relevant for setting proper PK fields in models.\n- `Options._prepare`: Prepares model options, including setting up a PK from parent classes.\n- `Options`: The options class contains configuration for the model class. This would include details about primary key fields.\n- `Options._get_default_pk_class`: Returns the default primary key class for models if specific configurations are present.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Original Code Block (Lines 410-426, `django/conf/global_settings.py`):\n  ```\n  0418) DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.AutoField'\n  ```\n  Modified Code Block:\n  ``` \n  418: DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'\n  ```\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch changes the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` in `django/conf/global_settings.py` from `'django.db.models.AutoField'` to `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'`. This modification implies that the default primary key type for auto-created fields will be `BigAutoField` instead of `AutoField`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch addresses the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting directly within the `global_settings.py`. This is the appropriate setting in Django's configuration to address the issue where auto-created primary key fields result in the system check W042 warning. Therefore, the patch is indeed addressing the correct function to presumably suppress the warning mentioned in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere doesn't seem to be any newly introduced logical issues or syntax errors by changing the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting. Also, there are no contradictions found between the patch and the identified code spans since changing the default auto field won't interfere directly with model field definitions within these spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile changing the `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting to 'BigAutoField' may resolve the warnings concerning auto-created primary keys, it imposes that all auto-created primary key fields moving forward will now be of type `BigAutoField`. This change doesn't take into account cases where models legitimately use `AutoField` by design. The candidate fix may lead to other areas of unexpected changes unless explicitly intended. Additionally, developers may not want this to be a global setting since AutoField could be preferred in other contexts outside of those throwing the W042 warning.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>5</score>"

Central portions of logic implementing said PK, tied options core functions, are yet touched.\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch adjusts the default primary key field type globally but does not directly address the primary issue related to inherited primary key warnings (`models.W042`).

However, it doesn't directly respond to pre-overridden configurations at the model or app-config level handled by spans such as `Options._get_default_pk_class`. It may fail or remain incomplete if models explicitly require their ancestors\u2019 primary key configurations. Common LLM mistakes such as overlooking inherited model structures or intricately overridden app/model-specific configurations are partially present.

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is related to a Django 3.2 alpha version warning (models.W042) when inheriting models with a manually specified primary key. In this version, auto-created primary keys are being used despite a primary key being explicitly defined in the parent model, which is causing these warnings. To resolve this, the framework should recognize and carry over the primary key from the inherited model instead of auto-creating a new one.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\ncheck_all_models\nModel\nModel._check_default_pk\nAutoFieldMixin\nOptions.setup_pk\nOptions._prepare\nOptions\nOptions._get_default_pk_class\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **check_all_models (span_id=check_all_models)**: This span contains the function `check_all_models` that runs system checks on the models, including ones related to primary keys. It\u2019s relevant because the system checks might trigger the warning mentioned in the issue.\n\n2. **class Model (span_id=Model)**: This span defines the base class for all models in Django. Since the issue is about model class inheritance, this span is relevant.\n\n3. **Model._check_default_pk (span_id=Model._check_default_pk)**: This span contains method `_check_default_pk` which specifically checks if an auto-created primary key exists and raises the warning. This method is directly responsible for the warning described in the issue.\n\n4. **AutoFieldMixin (span_id=AutoFieldMixin)**: This span defines `AutoFieldMixin` class. Given that AUTO-created primary keys mentioned in the warning use AutoField, this span is part of identifying and setting such fields.\n\n5. **Options.setup_pk (span_id=Options.setup_pk)**: This span contains the method `setup_pk` which is involved in setting up the primary key. It plays a vital role in primary key determination and thus is directly related to the handling of primary keys in inherited models.\n\n6. **Options._prepare (span_id=Options._prepare)**: This span involves method `_prepare` which prepares the model metadata, including primary keys.
