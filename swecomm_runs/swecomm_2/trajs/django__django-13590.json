This is where Django\u2019s `query.py` processes items within a tuple, leading to the reported issue due to incorrect reconstitution of named tuples. The expansion of this method to correctly reconstitute named tuples resolves the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk:\n```\n(1077) elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n(1078) # Check if value is a named tuple by looking for '_fields' attribute.\n...\n(1081) if hasattr(type(value), '_fields'):  # Checks if this is a named tuple\n(1082) return type(value)(*[\n(1083) self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n(1084) for sub_value in value\n(1085) ])\n(1086) else:\n...\n```\nThe patch checks if a tuple is a named tuple by checking for the `_fields` attribute. If it's indeed a named tuple, it reconstructs it by expanding the contents of the iterator into the tuple\u2019s constructor using the `*` operator. If it's a regular tuple or list, it follows the original logic.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `resolve_lookup_value` in the `Query` class. This method was directly mentioned in the issue description as the source of the error and the needed fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduced no contradictions with the identified code spans. It neatly extends the handling logic within `resolve_lookup_value` to cater specifically to named tuples, ensuring the overall function's conceptual integrity. It does not push changes outside the relevant functional scope nor injures existing logic. No new issues were identified.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly identifies the logic where named tuples are mishandled and integrates a conditional check for named tuples by looking for the `_fields` attribute. This conditional adheres to common practices in Python associated with named tuple identification. Utilizing the splat (`*`) operator correctly addresses the named tuple constructor's requirement for individual elements rather than an encapsulated iterator. The patch adheres to the prescribed solution from the issue description and follows reasonable Python programming tenets to resolve the mishandling scenario. The resolution does not misstep into common pitfalls like bypassing critical type checks or mishandling generics in list comprehensions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It first resolves each element and then reconstructs the named tuple with expanded elements (`*resolved_values`) if it is a named tuple, or with the normal list tuple otherwise.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The `resolve_lookup_value` method is indeed where the issue mentioned takes place, as it involves the reconstitution of tuples leading to the error when using named tuples.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any apparent new issues.

Previously, the project used named 2-tuples as arguments to `range` queryset filters without any issues. However, in Django 3.0, this causes an error: `TypeError: __new__() missing 1 required positional argument: 'far'`.

Since named tuples cannot be constructed using an iterator due to argument mismatches, this leads to the error. The solution is to unpack the iterator into the constructor for named tuples.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation:\nNext, let's determine which code spans are relevant to this issue and explain their roles.\n\n- Span IDs: `Range`, `Query.resolve_lookup_value`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **`Range` (django/db/models/lookups.py, Span ID: Range)**: This code span defines a `Range` lookup within Django's ORM framework. It is registered using a Field lookup decorator and might be implicated in how the `_range` queryset lookup is interpreted.\n  \n- **`Query.resolve_lookup_value` (django/db/models/sql/query.py, Span ID: Query.resolve_lookup_value)**: This code span defines the `resolve_lookup_value` function, which is critical to this issue.

If it is, it unpacks the iterator into the constructor. Otherwise, it retains the former behavior for normal tuples and lists.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location Validation:\nLet's verify if the patch was applied to the correct location.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes. The patch modifies the `resolve_lookup_value` function in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which is correctly identified as the genesis of the issue. The logic to reconstruct the tuple was the flawed piece causing problems with named tuples. Thus, the patch targets the correct location.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Introduction Check:\nCheck if adding the patch introduces any fresh issues or contradicts existing code.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces an additional condition to differentiate between named tuples and other iterables. This doesn't appear to conflict with the previous behavior for normal tuples or lists. The insertion of named tuple reconstruction using argument unpacking thus doesn't introduce observable new issues and fits seamlessly within the existing logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Resolution Check:\nEvaluate if the patch genuinely resolves the reported issue and ensure no common LLM mistakes are present.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by introducing an important check for named tuples using the `_fields` attribute and then properly unpacking the iterator into the constructor. This ensures that `__new__` receives the correct number of arguments.\n\nThe implementation shows a clear understanding of named tuples and their inability to be restructured using an iterator alone. No evident LLM mistakes such as misunderstanding Python usage or misplacing arithmetic operations were found.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score:\nFinal evaluation score is given based on correctness, effectiveness, and lack of contradictions or new issues.\n\n<score>10</score>"
