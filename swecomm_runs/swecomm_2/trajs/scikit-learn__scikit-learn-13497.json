Understand the candidate patch\n\n[List of Modified Hunk]\n1. Lines 250 to 258 in `mutual_info_.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The hunk appears to update the check for `discrete_features == 'auto'` to a stricter type check: `if isinstance(discrete_features, str) and discrete_features == 'auto':`. This ensures that the comparison only takes place if `discrete_features` is indeed of type string.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly addresses the issue within the function `_estimate_mi`, which is the location where `discrete_features` is being compared to 'auto' and needs to be type-checked properly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict the identified code spans. However, an additional check remains missing \u2013 validating whether `discrete_features` contains only boolean values or valid indices after converting to `np.asarray(discrete_features)`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does address the comparison issue between `discrete_features` and 'auto' safely by incorporating a type check. Although it does enhance type safety and correctness, it does not entirely ensure `discrete_features` validity when it is an array or mask after the assignment `np.asarray(discrete_features)` further down. This incorporation is partial and assumes on some previous code undocumented validation, this may result in latent issues especially if misshaped or faulty arrays are checked down the workflow.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Understanding the candidate patch:\nModified Hunks:\n- Test Function changes in `sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_mutual_info.py` on lines 200-207.\n- Documentation change in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` on lines 214-216.\n- `_estimate_mi` Conditional Check Change in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` on lines 254-255.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- In `sklearn/feature_selection/tests/test_mutual_info.py`:\n  The patch adds additional test cases to cover scenarios where `discrete_features` is an array of indices (`mi_5`). These new tests include shape assertions and comparisons to other mutual information calculation paths (`mi_2` and `mi_4`).\n\n- In `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py` Docstring:\n  The patch adds documentation indicating a version change starting `v0.23`, specifying the new `'auto'` default for `discrete_features`, which was formerly `False`.\n\n- In the `_estimate_mi` function in `sklearn/feature_selection/mutual_info_.py`:\n  The code modifies the comparison from `if discrete_features == 'auto':` to `if np.array_equal(discrete_features, 'auto'):` making the check more robust to compare array-like structures properly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is appropriately targeting the `_estimate_mi` function where the comparison `discrete_features == 'auto'` occurs and could cause the expected issue. The documentation update in the same file and enhancing the test coverage helps address the issue completely.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere do not appear to be new issues introduced by this patch. The switch from a direct equality check to using `np.array_equal` ensures robust type checking compatible with diverse numpy array types and does not wreck opposites in the identified code,\n</new_issues_exp> \n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the field-specific problem where `discrete_features` might be compared misleadingly against `'auto'` by refining the comparison util with `np.array_equal`. This, along with the added scenarios expansions & validations in the test ensures handling the condition across diverse type forecasts, stabilize towards preventing false cfg breakups exhibited.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

This type of comparison will raise errors in future versions of numpy and implies that the function does not properly handle when `discrete_features` is not 'auto'.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**:\n\n   List of span ids:\n   - span_id: _estimate_mi\n\n   <code_span_exp>\n   The `_estimate_mi` function is directly relevant to the issue text since it contains the code portion that performs the problematic `discrete_features == 'auto'` comparison. This function needs to clearly handle the different types that `discrete_features` can take (i.e., boolean, array of indices, or boolean mask) without relying on potentially error-prone string comparison.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**:\n\n   List of modified hunks:\n   - Hunk 1: Lines 250-252 modified from `if discrete_features == 'auto':` to `if isinstance(discrete_features, str) and discrete_features == 'auto':`\n   - Hunk 2: Lines 258-260 modified the type-check conditional block for discrete features.\n   \n   <patch_exp>\n   - **Hunk 1**: Modifies the condition to more safely compare `discrete_features` to 'auto' by additionally checking if `discrete_features` is an instance of `str`.\n   - **Hunk 2**: Adds an additional check to confirm if `discrete_features` has the dtype `int`. If so, it creates and sets a boolean mask accordingly.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Fixing the Correct Function**:\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modifications focus on the `_estimate_mi` function where the `discrete_features` comparison with 'auto' occurs, and also correctly adjusts for the type of `discrete_features`.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introduction of New Issues**:\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch does not seem to introduce new issues. It enhances the type checks for `discrete_features` to ensure accurate comparisons and assignments. Additionally, the logic remains consistent with handling `discrete_features` as a boolean mask or as indices, based on its type.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Effectiveness in Fixing the Issue**:\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch effectively fixes the issue by ensuring `discrete_features` is compared to the string 'auto' only when it is indeed a string, addressing possible future issues with numpy and improper type handling. It demonstrates a clear understanding of the variability in types that `discrete_features` can take and adjusts the logic to ensure correct behavior for both boolean and integer array cases. Furthermore, the normal handling and subsequent use of `discrete_features` as proposed aligns accurately with the function's intent, mitigating errors mentioned in the issue.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
