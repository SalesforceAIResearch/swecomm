It includes the `through`, `through_fields`, and `db_constraint` attributes which are all part of the tuple returned by `identity`.\n  \n  <code_span_exp>The `identity` property span is critical to this issue because it constructs a tuple containing `through`, `through_fields`, and `db_constraint` that are used to calculate the hash. The problem arises when `through_fields` is a list because lists are not hashable by default in Python.</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n- Modified Hunks:\n\nHunk 1 (from `301` to `320`):\n\n- Adds the `make_hashable` import.\n- Changes the `identity` property to apply `make_hashable` to `self.through_fields`.\n\nExplanation of each hunk:\n  \n  Hunk 1:\n  - Adds the import for `make_hashable`.\n    ```python\n    from django.utils.functional import make_hashable\n    ```\n  - Modifies the `identity` property to apply `make_hashable` to `self.through_fields`.\n    ```python\n    self.through,\n    make_hashable(self.through_fields),\n    self.db_constraint,\n    ```\n\n<patch_exp>The patch first imports the `make_hashable` function from `django.utils.functional`. It then modifies the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel` class to apply `make_hashable` to `self.through_fields` before adding it to the identity tuple, thereby ensuring the entire `identity` tuple is hashable.</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\nThe patch directly modifies the right function (`identity`) within the `ManyToManyRel` class to ensure that `through_fields`, when included in `identity`, is hashable. The addition of `make_hashable` to `through_fields` correctly addresses the issue.\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch modifies the correct function, `identity`, within the `ManyToManyRel` class.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\nThe patch seems self-contained and does not introduce changes to other parts of the functionality. There are no identified contradictions with existing aspects of the code spans provided.\n\n<new_issues_exp>No new issues seem to be introduced by the patch. It straightforwardly ensures `through_fields` is hashable when included in `identity`.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\nThe patch follows the proposed solution to make `through_fields` hashable using `make_hashable`. It doesn't appear to be missing any components or making any inappropriate changes.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch correctly fixes the issue by making `through_fields` within the `identity` property hashable using the `make_hashable` function.
