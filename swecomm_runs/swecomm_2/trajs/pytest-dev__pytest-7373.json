It caches the evaluated results based on the condition string without considering the global context dependencies, leading to incorrect evaluations in different contexts.\n\n- **imports**: The import section is relevant, especially with the removal of `cached_eval`, ensuring no import dependencies break.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nmodified hunks: [src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py#L13-33, src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py#L83-101]\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1 (src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py#L13-33)**: This hunk removes the `cached_eval` function entirely. Since caching is the source of the issue as mentioned, removing the function itself eliminates the root cause of the problem.\n  \n- **Hunk 2 (src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py#L83-101)**: This hunk modifies the `_istrue` method in such a way that it replaces the call to `cached_eval` with an `eval` execution directly within the method, removing the redundant and problematic caching mechanism. The direct use of `eval` with the compiled expression ensures that the global context is correctly considered.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct locations. It removes the problematic `cached_eval` function and updates the `_istrue` method in the `MarkEvaluator` class where the cached evaluation was being used. These changes directly address the caching issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It removes redundant caching and replaces it with direct evaluation using `eval`, which adheres to the problem statement. No identified code spans are contradicted or invalidated by this change.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively removes the cached_eval, addressing the core issue directly by inlining evaluation. This ensures that evaluations consider the correct global context each time. The change is straightforward and seems to be a complete fix for the mentioned problem about caching incorrect results.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Score\n\n<score>9</score>"

When using `@pytest.mark.skipif(\"condition\")`, the current implementation caches the evaluated conditions based solely on the string expression, ignoring the test item's global variables. This results in incorrect caching behavior when running tests across multiple files, as seen in the provided example. The proposed fix is to remove the caching and directly evaluate the string condition without caching.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- List of Span IDs: \n  - MarkEvaluator._istrue\n  - MarkEvaluator\n  - MarkEvaluator._getglobals\n  - cached_eval\n  - imports\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `MarkEvaluator._istrue`: This function checks whether the conditions of a mark (such as `skipif` or `xfail`) are true or not.

It's the central point where caching issues become visible when the condition is evaluated.\n- `MarkEvaluator`: This identifies the class responsible for evaluating pytest marks which includes `skipif` and `xfail`.\n- `MarkEvaluator._getglobals`: This method retrieves the global variables used in the string condition evaluation. Since incorrect caching relies on these variables, this method is significant to the problem.\n- `cached_eval`: This is the function responsible for the cached evaluation of string expressions. It's implicated directly in the problem since it's causing incorrect results due to its caching mechanism.\n- `imports`: This identifies any dependencies used throughout the `evaluate.py` module, ensuring that changes maintain necessary import statements or avoid redundant ones.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Hunk 1: Changes at: 93-109 in `evaluate.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1: The entire caching mechanism using `cached_eval` within `MarkEvaluator._istrue` is replaced by a direct non-cached `eval` execution of the string expression using global variables.\n\nBefore:\n```python\nresult = cached_eval(self.item.config, expr, d)\n```\n\nAfter:\n```python\nresult = eval(expr, d)\n```\nThis alteration means every evaluation bypasses the cache entirely, addressing the issue of shared cache invalidating independent expression evaluations.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is indeed fixing the correct function. Identified from the issue, `cached_eval` usage within `MarkEvaluator._istrue` is the cause of the problem. The modification effectively swaps cached evaluation to immediate execution via plain `eval`, precisely within the relevant method.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues or contradict any identified code spans. However, considering the outright removal of `cached_eval` and employing an uncached `eval`, it fails to address the trust on `expr` validity and reusability checkpoints for potential optimizations historically handled via caching.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the described issue by eliminating the flawed caching mechanism via `cached_eval`. It ensures each expression is evaluated afresh, respecting its unique globals. One oversight could be potential inefficiencies or missed opportunities on consistent evaluations where cache reuse would be beneficial, though correctness prioritizes this compromise. Additionally, switching to raw `eval` negates potential protections/adaptations managed by `cached_eval`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score the patch:**\n<score>9</score>"
