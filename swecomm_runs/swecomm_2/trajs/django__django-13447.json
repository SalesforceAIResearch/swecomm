Specifically, the user wants to manipulate the `app_list` in their custom admin view and needs access to the model class itself (currently a dictionary with serialized model data) in order to achieve this. Additionally, the user recommends making the `_build_app_dict` method public, as it is used in the `index` and `app_index` views.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n- List of span IDs:\n  - AdminSite._build_app_dict\n  - AdminSite.get_app_list\n  - AdminSite.index\n  - AdminSite.app_index\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **AdminSite._build_app_dict**:\n  This method is central to the issue because it constructs the app dictionary used throughout the admin views. It will need to expose the model class in the constructed dictionary for usage in custom admin views.\n\n- **AdminSite.get_app_list**:\n  This method calls `_build_app_dict` to get a sorted list of installed apps. This needs to be validated to ensure it properly interacts with the modified `_build_app_dict`.\n\n- **AdminSite.index**:\n  The `index` method presents the main admin index page, showing the list of installed apps retrieved using `get_app_list`. Any changes to `_build_app_dict` can affect how data is shown here.\n\n- **AdminSite.app_index**:\n  Similar to the `index` method, `app_index` works with a filtered `app_list`. It will require modifications reflecting the changes implemented in `_build_app_dict`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n- List of Modified Hunks:\n  - Modifying _build_app_dict to make it public and include the model class in the dictionary.\n  - Changing references from `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1**:\n  This hunk changes `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict`, effectively making the previously protected method public at line 433.\n\n- **Hunk 2**:\n  This hunk modifies the dictionary inside the `build_app_dict` at line 466 to include the actual model class.\n\n- **Hunk 3**:\n  This hunk updates the `get_app_list` method to reference the now public `build_app_dict` at line 507.\n\n- **Hunk 4**:\n  This hunk changes references from `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict` inside the `index` method.\n\n- **Hunk 5**:\n  This hunk makes similar changes to the `app_index` method, ensuring it now uses the public `build_app_dict` instead of `_build_app_dict`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct Function Evaluation**\n- Correct Location Evaluation:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct function by making `_build_app_dict` public and updating all respective references to this method.

It makes `_build_app_dict` public which aligns with the requirement and includes the model class in the app dictionary, allowing for necessary manipulations in the custom admin view. It captures common source mistakes, such as method references changes and correctly matching function names across different modules.\n One point to note is the clear communication of these updates, particularly making `_build_app_dict` public so all dependent modules and affected code are aware.\n\nAdditionally, unit tests adjusting the public method and asserting console outputs would boost confidence in this patch massively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score Evaluation**\n\n<score>8</score>"

Currently, the `app_list` is a serialized model dictionary, which is insufficient for certain custom operations. To resolve this, the suggestion is to add the model class to the `app_list` context. Additionally, the `_build_app_dict` method, which constructs this `app_list`, should be made public so that it can be used by other methods.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span IDs:\n- AdminSite._build_app_dict\n- AdminSite.get_app_list\n- AdminSite.index\n- AdminSite.app_index\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **AdminSite._build_app_dict**: This method is pivotal for constructing the `app_list`. It filters and organizes the models based on their permissions and app labels, which is directly relevant to modifying the contents and structure of the `app_list`.\n- **AdminSite.get_app_list**: This method obtains a sorted list of installed apps by invoking `_build_app_dict`. Given that `_build_app_dict` is envisioned to be made public, changes here will utilize the updated method name.\n- **AdminSite.index**: This method renders the main admin index page by using `get_app_list` to fetch the `app_list`.

Additionally, the changes to include the model class in the `model_dict` are correctly placed within the relevant method that constructs the app dictionary.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues that contradict the identified code spans.

Making `_build_app_dict` public as `build_app_dict` ensures that the functionality can be reused by the two methods (index and app_index), as intended. No apparent common LLM mistakes, such as missing or mislabeling keys, are evident in this patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

References to the function `_build_app_dict` in the methods `get_app_list`, `index`, and `app_index` were updated to match the new public method name:\n   ```python\n   app_dict = self.build_app_dict(request)  # Was app_dict = self._build_app_dict(request)\n   app_dict = self.build_app_dict(request, app_label)  # Was app_dict = self._build_app_dict(request, app_label)\n   ```\n   \n4. Model classes are added into the dictionary within `build_app_dict`:\n   ```python\n   model_dict = {\n       'model': model,  # Added model class to the dictionary\n       # other properties...\n   }\n   ```\n   \n5. In `app_index`, the context explicitly pulls the model class information from the `app_dict`:\n   ```python\n   'models': [model['model'] for model in app_dict['models']],  # Extract model classes for context\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct location check\nThe patch is correctly targeting the necessary locations \u2013 making the `_build_app_dict` method public and adding the model class details to the context where required.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly targets the location of the issue. It makes the `_build_app_dict` method public and updates all references to it in relevant methods.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for new issues\nThe patch seems to add necessary changes without causing immediate contradictions. \n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to have been introduced. The patch harmonizes well with the modifications, based on the identified code spans.\n</new_sissues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Fix Issue Assessment\nThe patch addresses the issue description correctly by adding the model class and making the method public. Potential common issues with LLMs like forgetting references, syntax errors, or logical fallacies haven't surfaced here. The implementation also updates all references to `_build_app_dict` accordingly.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully fixes the issue by correctly implementing the addition of the model class to the app list context and making `_build_app_dict` public.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>\n9\n</score>"
