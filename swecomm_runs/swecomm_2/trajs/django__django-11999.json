This aligns with the problem's nature without conflicting with identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue correctly by ensuring that a user-defined `get_%s_display` method won't get overridden by Django\u2019s auto-generated method. However, the new check might introduce inconsistencies if the existing user-defined method does not conform to the automatic method's intended functionalities. While there aren't obvious common mistakes from LLMs evident here (like off-by-one errors, variable misuses etc.), careful review should still be done to ensure no edge cases or unintended side effects by method preservation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>\n10\n</score>"

If changes need to be made to allow custom `get_FIELD_display` methods, they must potentially be giving attention here.\n</span>\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<hunk>\nModification added lines introducing a new check using `display_method_name` ('get_%s_display' % self.name). This check verifies if the method already exists in the class using `hasattr()`. Thus, previously existing methods are not overridden by the default partial method.\n</hunk>\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch fixes the correct function. The problematic behavior originates in the `contribute_to_class` method in the field definition where `get_%s_display` methods are attached to model classes.</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>No new issues are identified. The `hasattr` check ensures that methods are not blindly overridden, aligning with the organization's use as intended before breaking with Django 2.2.</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch addresses the issue by checking for the presence of an existing `get_%s_display` method and using this check within the `contribute_to_class` method. The patch logically resolves the reported behavior and ensures previously existing methods are respected. It does not seem to display any common mistakes typically made by LLMs, such as missing edge cases, performance degredations, or added complexity.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "Sure, let's analyze the provided information and the candidate patch step by step.\n\n**Issue Description:**\nThe issue describes a problem where overriding the `get_FIELD_display` method in Django is not possible starting from version 2.2. This prevents custom logic from being executed when trying to override these methods.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue states that in Django 2.2 and later, the generated `get_FIELD_display` method (for example, `get_foo_bar_display`) in models cannot be overridden with custom logic, whereas it was possible in Django 2.1.\n</issue_exp>\n\n**Code Spans:**\nList of span IDs:\n- Model._get_FIELD_display\n- Field.contribute_to_class\n\nExplanation of each code span's relevance to the issue:\n\n<code_span_exp> \n1. Model._get_FIELD_display: \n   This ID is from `django/db/models/base.py`. The method `_get_FIELD_display` is the internal method that Django uses to create display labels for fields with `choices`. This mechanism is part of what creates the `get_FIELD_display` methods that the issue wants to override.\n\n2. Field.contribute_to_class: \n   This ID is from `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. The `contribute_to_class` method sets up the field for the model, including how the `get_FIELD_display` method is created. The relevant lines deal with whether the method should be added to the class, which is central to the problem.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Candidate Patch:**\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk modifying the `contribute_to_class` method in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n\nExplanation of what each hunk is doing:\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk addresses the `contribute_to_class` method. It first constructs the name for the display method (`get_%s_display` % self.name). Before adding this method to the model class, it checks if the method is already defined using `hasattr`. If not, it sets it with the partial method pointing to `_get_FIELD_display`, essentially allowing user-defined methods to exist.\n</patch_exp>\n\n**Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp> \nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, which is `contribute_to_class` in `Field` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. This is where the `get_FIELD_display` method gets defined and appended to the model class. \n</correct_location_exp>\n\n**Introducing New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seemingly introduce any new issues. It adds a safeguard to check for pre-existing user-defined methods before setting a Django internal partial method, which should prevent overriding.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n**Does the Patch Fix the Issue?:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by checking for the presence of a user-defined method before adding the Django auto-generated method. This matches the reported issue and the use case described where custom methods should be preserved in the model\u2019s namespace.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

If such a method exists, it sets it on the class using `setattr`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_prepare` method within the model's base class, which is an appropriate location since this method is called after the model meta is populated. Modifying this place ensures that custom methods are correctly set up and can override the default implementations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans. It enhances the `_prepare` method by conditionally setting custom display methods should they exist on the class.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the problem by adding an iteration over fields to set any user-defined display methods in the `_prepare` phase. It does this before handling order-related methods, ensuring no disruption to existing functionalities.\n\nThe patch does not fall into common LLM mistakes such as syntax errors, logical errors in the fixed code, misunderstanding the program's structure, or introducing conflicts with the identified code spans. \n\nHowever, two worth-mentioning points:\n1. Overriding methods that would work differently based on display can still be handled manually by developers in model definition. Integrating such special ownership comes with the burden to developers.\n2. This would still need a set of tests to ensure it comprehensively solves the issue across a variety of scenarios, including coexistence with the pre-defined contribute API consistent behavior enforced.\n\nOverall, this patch fixes the issue without introducing new conflicts.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Understanding how and where `get_FIELD_display` methods are attached to the model class may reveal why overriding these methods is not as expected in Django 2.2+.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of Modified Hunks:\n1. Hunks from lines 326-347 in `django/db/models/base.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1 (lines 326-347 in django/db/models/base.py)**:\n   The patch introduces a new block of code within the `_prepare` method of the model class which iterates over the fields in `opts.fields`. It constructs the method name `get_{field.name}_display` and checks if this method exists on the class. If the method exists, it ensures that this method is correctly added to the class with `setattr`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying `_prepare` method on the model class, which is responsible for creating dynamic methods, including subclassed methods. Therefore, it is modifying the correct location within the code.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch uses `getattr` to check and `setattr` to reapply methods to the model class dynamically if they exist. This should not introduce inconsistencies or new issues like removing existing dynamically constructed methods. No contradictions with the identified code spans have been found in this change.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the main issue by ensuring that custom `get_FIELD_display` methods are set correctly on the model class after `_meta` preparation. This addition iterates over fields to attach existing custom display methods (`get_{field.name}_display`) allowing these overrides to function properly in Django 2.2+, analogous to the behavior seen in version 2.1. \n\nThe patch doesn't counteract any common LLM mistakes like modifying unrelated sections drastically or failing to match method context due to the existing custom display method check (`hasattr`) and reassignment mechanism (`setattr`). The solution should preserve overridden `get_FIELD_display` behavior.\n\nThus, the candidate patch is reasonably expected to fix the issue described without providing evidence of errors or additional complications.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Added lines that define custom `get_FIELD_display` methods if present during the `_prepare` phase.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch adds code in `_prepare` method which iterates over the model fields and checks if a custom `get_FIELD_display` method exists. If it does, it re-assigns the method to ensure the override persists.\n\n- Lines added:\n  ```python\n  for field in opts.fields:\n      custom_display_method = 'get_%s_display' % field.name\n      if hasattr(cls, custom_display_method):\n          setattr(cls, custom_display_method, getattr(cls, custom_display_method))\n  ```\n  This block ensures that if a custom `get_FIELD_display` method exists for any field, it is correctly used, thereby attempting to override the default attached method.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the `_prepare` method in a logical location within `models.base` where new methods are constructed for a class. It\u2019s a spot where setting field methods would logically occur, aligning with the goal of enabling overrides for `get_FIELD_display`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check for New Issues introduced by the Patch\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modified patch does not introduce direct new conflicts with specified code spans. It follows existing coding conventions and leaves other attributive assignments similar as appears towards non-overlapping method phases. There is a slight overhead implied with additional checks but tolerable within setup nature.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if The Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the ability to override `get_FIELD_display` by augmenting the class method dynamically based on presence inference. The structure circumvents the overwriting issue of Django 2.2\u2019s method prepend handling, ensuring a custom definable function. This approach resolves the mismatch demonstrated via examples, allowing personalized field display logic.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n<score>9</score>"
