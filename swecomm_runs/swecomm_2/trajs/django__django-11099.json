Both classes are adjusted to use `\\A` and `\\Z` to correctly match the start and end of the string, resolving the reported problem.\nFurthermore, this change is isolated to the regex and does not contradict any of the preceding import statements.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately addresses the issue by changing the regex patterns which previously allowed trailing newlines due to the `$` character. The given problem is eliminated by switching to boundary markers `\\A` and `\\Z`, and thus ensures no trailing newlines can be matched.\nPotential pitfalls managed:\n- **Correct Regex Modifications**: The specific characters that needed changing in the regex were correctly identified and replaced.\n- **Consistent Implementation**: Both required regex validators (ASCII and Unicode) have consistent modifications, confirming thorough addressing of the root issues.\n\nAccordingly, there appears to be no mistakes or omissions that would invalidate the issue fix.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

In the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class, the regex was changed from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`, which uses the `\\A` and `\\Z` anchors to correctly match the start and end positions in a string, even in multi-line inputs.\n2. Similarly, the regex in the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class was modified from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'` to achieve the same effect, preventing trailing newlines.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct locations. It targets both the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` classes where the flawed regex patterns were initially defined.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and stays consistent with the function's goal in the relevant code spans. It solely focuses on rectifying the regex expressions. No contradictions are present between the patch and code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the problem by replacing the problematic regex anchors `^` and `$` with `\\A` and `\\Z`. These changes match the proposed solution in the issue description, addressing the loophole that allowed trailing newlines.\nCommon errors such as incorrect regex patterns, scope creep in patches, or partial solutions are absent here. The patch comprehensively updates both validators without introducing complications.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

This ensures consistent behavior between these two validators, preventing trailing newline characters in usernames.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `regex` attributes in both the ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator classes, which are the correct locations specified in the issue to fix the problem of allowing trailing newline characters.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking for New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. Both identified code spans for regex validators have been appropriately updated to use `\\A` and `\\Z` anchors. There are no contradictions with the import statements, and the regular expressions are validated to fix the existing problem.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly updates the regular expressions in both the ASCIIUsernameValidator and UnicodeUsernameValidator classes to use `\\A` and `\\Z` anchors, which ensures that the entire string (username) is matched between the start and end, thus preventing trailing newline characters. This change follows the recommended solution and addresses the issue raised.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the candidate patch.\n\n- Modified hunks:\n  - Modification of `regex` pattern in `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class.\n  - Modification of `regex` pattern in `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1: The candidate patch changes the regex in the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This change ensures that the pattern strictly matches the start and end of the string, thus preventing matching trailing newlines.\n\n- Hunk 2: Similarly, the patch modifies the regex in the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'`. This change is identical to the one made to the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class to ensure the same strict behavior for preventing trailing newlines.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict any of the identified code spans, and I'm not able to identify any new issues that may be introduced by changing the regex patterns to use `\\A` and `\\Z`. The changes are specific and should function correctly within their contexts.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue correctly as it replaces `^` with `\\A` and `$` with `\\Z` in the regex patterns. These adjustments address the problem where a trailing newline was being accepted due to the `$` character. The new patterns effectively disallow trailing newlines, adhering to the intended constraints.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. Score:\n\n<score>10</score>"
