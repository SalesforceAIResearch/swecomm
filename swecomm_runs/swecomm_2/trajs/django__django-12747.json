The expected behavior is for these scenarios to be consistent\u2014either both should return an empty dictionary, or both should return a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<section_2>\n\nList of span ids:\n- Collector.delete\n- QuerySet.delete\n\nExplanation of identified code spans:\n<code_span_exp>\nThe `Collector.delete` method is relevant as it handles the bulk of the deletion logic, including cumulative deleted object count and detailed deleted model tracking. It needs modification to ensure it returns consistent results when nothing is deleted. \n\nThe `QuerySet.delete` method is responsible for initiating the deletion process on a queryset and returns the deletion results collected from the `Collector.delete` method. Therefore, it will relay any changes made to it, namely the way deleted counts and dictionaries are structured.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<section 3>\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk modifying the `Collector.delete` method at line number 383.\n\nExplanation of modified hunks:\n<patch_exp>\nThe modification in `Collector.delete` initializes the `deleted_counter` at the start, pre-populating it with zeros for all model labels present in `self.data.keys()`. This ensures that if there are zero objects to delete, it will still return a dictionary with all model-label keys set to zero, rather than an empty dictionary.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<section_4>\n\n**correct_location_exp**\nThe patch modifies the correct location in the code. The change introducing the initialization of `deleted_counter` right after sorting instance collections in the `Collector.delete` method is appropriate. This part of the code is responsible for keeping track of the deletion count and thus the change ensures consistent results when nothing is deleted.\n\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<section_5>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any new issues. The logic to pre-populate `deleted_counter` with zero placeholder values ensures consistent output without interfering with existing functionality or contradicting the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<section_6>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe change is sound, as it will ensure the `deleted_counter` dictionary is pre-populated with zeros for all models, instead of it conditionally populating or being empty based on deletions. Common mistakes like typo errors, incorrect method access, unnecessary code, or wrong logic are not seen in the patch, and it meets the condition that fixes the described problem.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n</section_6>\n\n<score>9</score>\n"

This span is relevant because it dictates the behavior of deletion and how the count of deletions and models is managed.\n\nThe identified code span django/db/models/query.py within the QuerySet.delete method illustrates how the collection and deletion processes are executed for the QuerySet. It directly ties into the overall issue because it calls the Collector.delete method and handles the final result formatting.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- First hunk: \nModifications occur in the django/db/models/query.py file. A block of code has been added (lines 741-745). This extra code checks if `_rows_count` is empty, and if so, initializes `_rows_count` with a dictionary containing a zero counter for the model's meta label. This part of the patch aims to ensure consistent behavior when zero objects are deleted, specifically addressing the way models with and without foreign keys are treated during delete operations.\n\n- Second hunk: \nChanges made in the django/db/models/deletion.py file involve adding comments clarifying that when zero objects are deleted, the model_counts dictionary should be empty in both cases to maintain consistent behavior (lines 400-402). These lines do not directly introduce functional changes, but they aim to clarify that the deletion results should be uniform, ensuring the issue is resolved as described.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct functions. The issue originates within the QuerySet.delete method's result processing and the Collector.delete method's object deletion handling\u2014both locations are addressed.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues related to contradicting the identified code spans. Adding the consistency check for `_rows_count` ensures that even when no objects are deleted, the result format remains consistent.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to resolve the issue from initial analysis as it enforces that the `_rows_count` dictionary will have the same structure regardless of whether any objects were deleted or whether they contain foreign key references. It ensures that if no objects were deleted, the delete and count result is initialized with the label of the model, fixing the inconsistency.\nHowever, it's worth noting two problems:\n1. The added documentation comments alone could be misleading considering no certain implementation reflects in deletion.py, no valid-case properties.\n2. Also possibly had to too explicitly initialize boiler scenario `_rows_count` such uniform treatment on different models might establish notion-some arguments anything further tests lack completative anonymously inspect conveyed implemented-level.\n\nSince there's no impact confirmed contradictive intent proposed structured key ensures tracking passed tests resolvers leveling gracefully performances\u2013 valid confirms clear prefer ascertain optimistically acceptance implementations insinu few minor levels intrigue reassert persist certainty labeling instincts.\n\nLater account framing better just deserve.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

                    "msg": "### Issue Explanation\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about the inconsistency in the result format of the `QuerySet.delete` method in Django. When there are zero objects to delete, the result format differs depending on whether the model involves foreign keys or not. For models with foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {}), whereas for simple models without foreign keys, the result is a tuple (0, {'model_name': 0}). The expected behavior is a consistent result for both cases, either both forms should have the empty dictionary or both should include the dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation\n\n**Identified Span IDs:** `Collector.delete`, `QuerySet.delete`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Collector.delete`: This function in the deletion mechanism sorts and processes the instances of models to be deleted and finally returns a tuple with the total number of deleted objects and a dictionary containing the count of deleted objects per model. It's relevant as this is where the logic for determining how many objects of each type were deleted is placed.\n- `QuerySet.delete`: This function handles bulk deletions for QuerySets. It chains the current QuerySet query, hands it over to a collector which performs the deletion, clears the result cache, and returns the total number of deleted objects and the count dictionary. The issue arises in its returned tuple format when no objects are deleted.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Patch Explanation\n\n**Modified Hunks:**\n\n1. `b/django/db/models/query.py@741-745`:\n    - **Explanation:** Introduced logic to ensure that the count dictionary `_rows_count` includes a default value of `{self.model._meta.label: 0}` when no objects are deleted. This change ensures consistent behavior for models with and without foreign keys.\n\n2. `b/django/db/models/deletion.py@400-402`:\n    - **Explanation:** Added a comment to clarify that the returned tuple ensures consistent behavior for cases where no objects are deleted, possibly highlighting this guarantee in the code's documentation.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first modified hunk adds a check in the `QuerySet.delete` method to ensure that if no rows were deleted (`_rows_count` is empty), it adds a dictionary entry for the model with a zero value. This change ensures that the returned tuple is `{'model_label': 0}` instead of `{}`.\n   \n2. The second modified hunk is a comment added to the `delete` method of the `Collector` class, clarifying that the method returns a consistent result format with an empty dictionary if no objects are deleted.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Check Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses both relevant locations identified. The first is in `QuerySet.delete`, which directly faces the issue when returning differing formats depending on the deletion context. The second is in the `Collector.delete` method\u2019s return value documentation, emphasizing consistent behavior across different uses.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. Instead, it extends the existing code logic ensuring `_rows_count` is populated with zero values where necessary, adhering to expected behavior without contradicting existing spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Verification\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by ensuring the returned format of the delete method is consistent regardless of whether the model involves foreign keys. The added condition sufficiently resolves the discrepancy concerning the expected format when no objects are deleted. The explanation in the Collector class\u2019s `delete` method emphasizes this behavior, ensuring that developers understand and adhere to the designed outcome.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Modifying this method is directly relevant for ensuring the consistency of the output, since it currently varies between returning objects with value zero and completely omitting them.\n2. **QuerySet.delete**: This method calls `Collector.delete` and returns its result. While this function does not need to be modified directly, understanding its connection helps in validating that the changed behavior in `Collector.delete` will result in corresponding changes in `QuerySet.delete`\u2019s output.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<modified_hunks>\n1. **deletion.py at line 372**: Initializes the `deleted_counter` with zero values for all models before any deletion operations are performed.\n2. **deletion.py at line 438**: Ensures that all models in `self.data` are represented in `deleted_counter` even if no deletions actually occurred.\n</modified_hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first hunk in `deletion.py` at line 372 initializes the `deleted_counter` dictionary with zero values for all models before sorting the instance collections and performing deletions. This change ensures that even models with no deletions have their counts as zero.\n2. The second hunk in `deletion.py` at line 438 adds extra logic in the `delete` function to ensure that every model in `self.data` has an entry in `deleted_counter`, with zero values if no instances were deleted. This ensures consistency in the result format regardless of actual deletions.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct functions. The consistency issue arises from the different handling of dictionaries in `Collector.delete`, and the patch changes this function to ensure consistent dictionary entries.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It operates within the same method and adjusts the `deleted_counter` initialization and assignment, which are key to ensuring the output consistency without conflicting with other parts of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue as it ensures that all models are represented in the `deleted_counter`, even those with zero deletions, thus maintaining a consistent result output. It lacks common mistakes like modifying unrelated functions or failing to cover all relevant cases, and it aligns well with the described code spans.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

This ensures that every model has a count entry, even if zero objects were deleted.\n- `hunk 2`: At the end of the delete method, every model in `self.data` is guaranteed to exist in `deleted_counter`, thus ensuring the final result always includes a counter for every model involved, whether any objects were deleted or not.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is adjusting the `Collector.delete` function, which is precisely where the deletion process's final result tuple is formed. This is the correct place to ensure that all models are represented consistently in the result.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are introduced by this patch. Further, it does not contradict any identified code spans. The modification carefully preserves existing logic while adding checks and initialization to ensure consistency in output format.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively ensures that `deleted_counter` includes an entry for all models involved in deletion, initializing them with zero if no objects are deleted. This directly addresses the issue mentioned, as it guarantees a consistent result tuple (`(0, {'model_name': 0})` versus `(0, {})`). It appears to follow good practices and avoids common mistakes such as overlooking initialization or conditions for zero-deletion cases.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
