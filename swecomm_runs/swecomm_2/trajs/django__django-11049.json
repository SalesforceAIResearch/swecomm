The current error message suggests that the expected format is `[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]`, which implies that hours are mandatory if minutes are provided. However, the actual behavior indicates that the format should be `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]`, where minutes and hours are optional if seconds are provided.\n  \n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the error message for the `DurationField` in Django has an incorrect format. The actual behavior of the `DurationField` allows the format `[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]`, where seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are optional if minutes are provided. However, the error message wrongly indicates that it should be `[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]`, making hours appear mandatory when minutes are present.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n**Identified Code Span IDs:** [\"SPAN_ID=DurationField\"]\n\n1. Location: `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n    ```\n    (1580) class DurationField(Field):\n    (1581)     \"\"\"\n    (1582)     Store timedelta objects.\n    (1583) \n    (1584)     Use interval on PostgreSQL, INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND on Oracle, and bigint\n    (1585)     of microseconds on other databases.\n    (1586)     \"\"\"\n    (1587)     empty_strings_allowed = False\n    (1588)     default_error_messages = {\n    (1589)         'invalid': _(\"'%(value)s' value has an invalid format. It must be in \"\n    (1590)                      \"[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu] format.\")\n    (1591)     }\n    (1592)     description = _(\"Duration\")\n    ```\n   \n<code_span_exp>\n1. Span ID: `DurationField`\nThis code span defines the `DurationField` class including its `default_error_messages`. This is especially relevant to the issue because one of the erroneous formats indicated in the error message resides here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n**Modified Hunks:**\n1. Location: `django/forms/fields.py` from line 463\n    ```diff\n    - 'invalid': _('Enter a valid duration.')\n    + 'invalid': _('Enter a valid duration. The format should be [DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu], where seconds are mandatory, minutes and hours are optional.')\n    ```\n\n2. Location: `django/forms/fields.py` starting at line 488\n    ```diff\n    - def prepare_value(self, value):\n    - if isinstance(value, datetime.timedelta):\n    -     return duration_string(value)\n    - return value\n    + def __init__(self, *, help_text=_(\"Enter duration in the format: [DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]. Days and hours are optional.\"), **kwargs):\n    + kwargs.setdefault('help_text', help_text)\n    + super().__init__(**kwargs)\n    ```\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. First Hunk:\nModifies the `'invalid'` error message in the `DurationField` class to provide a more precise format. The new message reads: \"Enter a valid duration. The format should be [DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu], where seconds are mandatory, minutes and hours are optional.\"\n\n2. Second Hunk:\nAdds a `help_text` parameter in the `DurationField`, describing the expected input format: \"Enter duration in the format: [DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]. Days and hours are optional.\" The `help_text` is provided if not already specified.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check Correct Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the DurationField class both at the location where the default error message is defined and where the class is instantiated. This is the correct place to make the changes described in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n- The only identified code span that could contradict the patch resides in the error message within the `DurationField` class in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`.\n- The patch doesn't update the error message in this identified code span.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not modify the error message in the `DurationField` class located in the file `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` from the identified code span. This would result in inconsistency between the error messages across the codebase, introducing a new issue.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n- The patch correctly modifies the error message for `DurationField` to state the right format.\n- However, the update is incomplete as the error message in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` is not updated.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch partially addresses the issue by correcting the error message format and adding `help_text` to `DurationField`, it fails to update all instances of the error message which could lead to inconsistent error reporting. Hence, the issue isn't fully fixed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The current error message states that the required format is \"[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]\". According to the issue, this is invalid since seconds are mandatory, minutes are optional, and hours are only optional if minutes are provided. Therefore, the correct format should be \"[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]\". The improvement involves updating the error message and adding a default help text with the correct format for the `DurationField`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n\nList of span ids:\n- DurationField\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span ID: DurationField: This code span refers to the part of Django's codebase where the `DurationField` class is defined. It includes the definition for `default_error_messages` which contains the faulty message requiring the incorrect format \"[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]\". It is directly related to the issue because this message needs to be corrected. The issue also indicates the need for help text, which would logically be included in or alongside this class.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk 1: Update error message format\n- Hunk 2: Add help_text for formfield\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1: The existing error message format \"[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu]\" is changed to \"[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]\" in the `default_error_messages` dictionary's 'invalid' message. This change reflects the updated and correct format description as stated in the issue.\n- Hunk 2: In the `formfield` method, a help_text argument is added to include guidance for the format \"[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu]\" to assist users in understanding how to input their duration values correctly. This aligns with the issue\u2019s suggestion to have the syntax easily understood.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the `DurationField` class, which is the correct location as it includes both the default error message and the form field configuration where users are interacting with duration inputs.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues or Contradictions:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues or contradictions. It updates the error message format as described, and adds a helpful text with the correct format which should enhance user understanding and does not create discernible conflicts with the rest of the code span provided.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue efficiently. It addresses the incorrect format in the error message and adds a help_text attribute to actually communicate the expected input format to the user. Common mistakes like ignoring context, making syntactically incorrect changes, or affecting unrelated functionality are avoided. Thus, the patch aligns well with the described requirements in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score:**\n\n<score>10</score>"

These modifications directly match the problem described in the issue. There are a few things to note, though:\n- The added `default_help_text` attribute could cause issues if it's not encapsulated within the right context. Despite this, given the modification, it might make sense to provide more generically applicable help text particularly within the `DurationField`.\n- However, integrating help_text into unrelated deeds such as DateField/formfield method of the patch might introduce unforeseen results, coupling which might not fit.\n\nHence, while appearing to solve the immediate issue, tighter integration testing and class scope review are needed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>\n"
