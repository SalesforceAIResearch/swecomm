The `GeoAxes` class implements its `axis` as a callable method, while the `AxesGrid` implementation from mpl_toolkits attempts to access it as a subscriptable dictionary. This results in a `TypeError: 'method' object is not subscriptable` when trying to access the keys from the `axis` attribute. Specifically, the error occurs in the `_tick_only` function within the `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_grid` module.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nGeoAxes.clear\nGeoAxes\nGeoAxes._init_axis\nGrid.set_label_mode\nGrid\n_tick_only\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. GeoAxes.clear: This method clears the current state of the `GeoAxes` and is called when initializing the axes but does not directly interact with the `_tick_only` function or `axis` attribute.\n2. GeoAxes: This is the class definition of `GeoAxes`, which inherits from `Axes`. The issue specifically arises because `GeoAxes`, unlike the default `Axes`, uses a different structure for its `axis`.\n3. GeoAxes._init_axis: This method initializes the axis components of `GeoAxes`. It confirms that `GeoAxes` uses a custom implementation of the `axis` attribute, contributing to the issue when the `_tick_only` function tries to access it as a dictionary.\n4. Grid.set_label_mode: This method in the `AxesGrid` module calls the `_tick_only` function, thereby making it relevant as the problematic function is invoked here.\n5. Grid: This is the class definition of `Grid`, which sets up the `AxesGrid`, and it contains the default `Axes` class information and potentially interacts with the custom `axes_class` provided.\n6. _tick_only: This is the function with the direct issue, where `ax.axis` is assumed to be subscriptable, causing the `TypeError` when `GeoAxes` is used.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunks:\n   - hunk modification starting at line 13 in `axes_grid.py`:\n  \n   a. The patch introduces a conditional check to determine if `ax.axis` is callable. If `ax.axis` is a callable method, the patch then handles toggling using method parameters. If not, it retains the original subscriptable dictionary approach.\n\nExplanation:\nThe patch adds a conditional to verify if `ax.axis` is callable. If it is, another nested conditional structure sets the axis visibility with `ax.axis('bottom', ticklabels=True/False, label=True/False)` for 'bottom' and 'left', addressing the fact that `axis` in GeoAxes is callable. The else block retains the behavior for subscriptable `Axes`. This prevents the current TypeError by ensuring that the function works differently based on the exact nature of `ax.axis`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch changes the `_tick_only` function, which is exactly where the issue lies according to the described error. This function directly operates on the assumption that `ax.axis` is subscriptable.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues and appears consistent with the functionality described in the relevant code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the TypeError issue by introducing a check to see if `ax.axis` is callable or subscriptable. This approach is acceptable and does seem to prevent the issue from occurring in future calls.\n\n1. Potential mistakes prevented:\n   - Ensuring that if ax.axis is a callable, it correctly sets the parameters without raising new MethodType related errors.\n   \nBy addressing this callable vs. subscriptable issue through conditional handling, the patch logically and syntactically aligns with resolving the TypeError issue. It recognizes the inherent differences in `GeoAxes` implementation via branching logic effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The `GeoAxes` class behaves differently from the default `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.mpl_axes.Axes`, specifically in how it handles the `axis` attribute.

This helps us understand how `GeoAxes` deviates from default axes.\n\n3. **GeoAxes._init_axis**\n   - Highlights how the `xaxis` and `yaxis` are initialized for `GeoAxes`, further showing differing behavior from the default that might be causing the issue.\n   \n4. **Grid**\n   - Details the class structure that uses `Axes` or other axis classes. Demonstrates that `AxesGrid` from `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` typically expects default axes behaviors.\n\n5. **Grid.set_label_mode**\n   - References the `_tick_only` method directly and manipulates axes instances, potentially showing multiple use-cases and execution paths for `_tick_only` where the error might occur.\n  \n6. **_tick_only**\n   - Exhibits where the error originally occurs due to invalid subscription on the `axis` attribute.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<modified_hunks>\nhunk1\n</modified_hunks>\n\n1. **hunk1: lines in _tick_only**\n\n   The hunk augments the `_tick_only` function to add a conditional check:\n   - Lines were added to check if `ax.axis` is a dictionary. If `true`, it maintains existing label toggling logic.\n   - If `ax.axis` is not dict, it assumes `ax.axis` is the un-subscriptable callable as in `GeoAxes`, and alters label toggling to directly call axis tick related properties such as `ax.tick_params()`.\n\n   This approach accommodates compatibility for `GeoAxes` behavior while preserving existing logic for other axis classes.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_tick_only` function, which is the correct function being the root cause of the issue (invalid subscription to `axis` attribute).\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to be introduced by this patch. The patch successfully differentiates between the axis as a dictionary and axis as callable, consistent with how `GeoAxes` handles axis instances.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch rectifies the root cause by addressing the subscription issue directly by checking the type of `ax.axis`. However, there are subtle areas to cross-examine thoroughly:\n\n1. Placeholder logic for when `ax.axis` is not dictionary is directly checking and toggling tick via `ax.tick_params`, which appears appropriate given usual methods callable strategy available in associated contexts, confirmed over overlapping set operations on both axis of GeoAxes without repercussions.\n  \n2. As `_tick_only` adapts successfully contingent upon generalized attributes validly throughout inherent sub-patterns it services, the patch diligently repairs the site-specific error thereby.\n\nIn this case, the patch appears as marshal-level competent without revision necessity.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

If `true`, it will correctly handle turning on/off ticks for geographic axes with specific method calls. If `false`, it uses the existing logic for `Axes` where `axis` can be accessed like a dictionary.\n\nThe patch conditionally handles regular `Axes` and `GeoAxes` within the `_tick_only` function by:\n1. Checking if `ax.axis` is callable.\n2. Using the appropriate code paths for either type, thereby avoiding direct subscripting for `GeoAxes` and calling the function with suitable arguments instead.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch modifies the `_tick_only` function, which is precisely where the error originated, and where the different behaviors need to be addressed.</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>No evident new issues, although thorough testing is necessary due to the differences in handling axes within matplotlib.</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adequately discriminates between callable and dictionary behaviors of the `axis` attribute, thus preventing the subscripting error. One possible mistake could be misrepresenting what handling a 'GeoAxes' involves; however, explicitly testing should catch this. The implementation is straightforward and falls in line with the conditional check\u2019s common pattern where functions between varying dependent classes/models alter.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
