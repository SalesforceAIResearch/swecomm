Changes in conditional handling at line 668\n\n### Explanation of Modified Hunks\n**Hunk 1**:\n- Modifies how `curr_stream` is checked before appending to the `stream` list.\n- Previously (line 669): `stream.append(curr_stream)`\n- Now (line 669): `if curr_stream: stream.append(curr_stream)`\n\nThis ensures that `curr_stream` is only appended if it is not `None`, therefore bypassing the error referred to in the issue.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch correctly checks if `curr_stream` is not `None` before appending it to `stream` (line 669), thereby preventing the `TypeError` when handling empty text lines.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Location\nThe patch modifies the logic directly within the `RendererPS.draw_text` method at the precise location where the `TypeError` was previously raised.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch alters the correct location in the `RendererPS.draw_text` method, specifically within the block handling font streams, thereby addressing the exact point of failure.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## Checking if the Patch Introduces Any New Issues\nThe patch introduces no evident new issues. It simply adds a condition to ensure that `None` values are not appended to `stream`.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues; it only includes a guard clause to prevent `None` types from being appended.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\nThe patch addresses the main issue by preventing the `NoneType` object from being appended to the `stream` list, aligning with common troubleshooting for similar errors involving `NoneType`. However, potential secondary checks might enhance this fix.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively prevents the `TypeError` by ensuring `None` values are not appended.

The issues emanate from the handling of text rendering within the `draw_text` method of the `RendererPS` class. Therefore, modifying the section of the code dealing with appending to the `stream` list is appropriate as it directly prevents the addition of a `NoneType` while processing text streams.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues. The check is specific and maintains the logic sequence of the current implementation. It fits within the flow of the current code patterns and enhances robustness by preventing the addition of `NoneType`, which prepares the stream correctly before downstream methods access it.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is potentially effective in fixing the issue by preventing the typing error caused by attempting to unpack a NoneType. By adding an `if curr_stream:` check, the patch avoids appending a NoneType to the list `stream`. This prevents breaking operations downstream that expect tuples in the list and not None. The patch handles this common LLM mistake of overlooking conditionality by explicitly affirming there's valid content before attempting to use or manipulate it.\n\nHowever, if `curr_stream` could theoretically reach here and be `None` without it breaking pre-existing logic downstream, this fix might create partial artifacts or inconsistencies that otherwise considerably keep consistency.
