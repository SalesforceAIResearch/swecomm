ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members\n\nExplanation:\n1. **ModuleDocumenter**: This class is responsible for documenting modules in Sphinx. It likely includes logic that handles member inclusion based on the `__all__` attribute.\n2. **ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members**: This method retrieves and filters the members of a module, so it directly involves deciding which members to document, making it relevant for addressing whether an empty `__all__` attribute should prevent any members from being documented.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. Change introduced in lines 1076-1077 to check if `__all__` is not `None` and has a length of zero, to return no members.\n2. Added these lines to distinguish between the scenarios when `__all__` is empty.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The code inserts a condition `if self.__all__ is not None and len(self.__all__) == 0`: This checks to see if the `__all__` attribute is an empty list and, if so, returns no members by returning `False, []`.\n2. The rest of the logic (which previously handled `want_all` and `not self.__all__`) remains largely untouched, except an additional check is enforced at the start to handle the empty `__all__` scenario specifically.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location within the `get_object_members` method in the `ModuleDocumenter` class. This method determines which members of the module to document and is the logical place to handle how `__all__` behaves.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo, the patch does not seem to introduce new issues. It adds an extra conditional check which is properly integrated within the existing flow. This change focuses specifically on addressing the case when `__all__` is empty, which is the appropriate action required by the issue.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch seems capable of fixing the issue. By adding the condition `if self.__all__ is not None and len(self.__all__) == 0`, it neatly handles the special case where `__all__` is an empty list. This ensures no module members are documented if the `__all__` list is intentionally left empty, addressing the bug described.\n\nCommon mistakes avoided:\n- The patch correctly checks both for `__all__` being `None` and having zero length, which is appropriate for this type of check.\n- It integrates the new condition at the function's top-level logic rather than deeper in nested logic where it could cause side-effects.\n- The added code logically flows with other existing conditions around `want_all` and `not self.__all__`.\n\nConsidering there don't seem to be any potential logic conflicts or oversights based on the implementation and the problem description, this patch appears robust and does not introduce any omissions or misbehavior in other parts of the method.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the issue\n**Explanation**:\nThe issue is that the Sphinx autodoc extension ignores an empty `__all__` attribute in a module. When `__all__` is empty in a module, like in this example:\n\n```python\n__all__ = []\n\ndef foo():\n    \"docstring\"\n\ndef bar():\n    \"docstring\"\n\ndef baz():\n    \"docstring\"\n```\n\nautodoc still documents all the functions (`foo`, `bar`, and `baz`), whereas the expected behavior is that it should document none since `__all__` is empty.\n\n<issue_exp>The problem is that Sphinx's autodoc extension currently documents all members of a module even when the `__all__` attribute is empty, contrary to the expectation that no members should be documented when `__all__` is an empty list.</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the identified code spans\n- **Identified code spans**: `ModuleDocumenter`, `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`\n\n**Explanation**:\n- `ModuleDocumenter` span defines the class for documenting modules.\n- `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` span contains the method which fetches the object members depending on the presence and content of the `__all__` attribute; hence, its processing deeply affects if the members should be documented or not.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe `ModuleDocumenter` class is relevant because it manages the documentation process for modules.\nThe `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` method is key here as it\u2019s responsible for determining which members of the module are to be documented, taking into account the presence and content of the `__all__` attribute.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the candidate patch\n- **Modified hunks**:\n  - **Hunk 1**: Adds a special condition to handle when `__all__` is an empty list.\n\n**Explanation**:\n- **Hunk 1**:\n  This hunk has a condition checking if `self.__all__` is not None and it contains zero elements. If the condition is met, it returns an empty result set (`False, []`), thus ignoring all members of the module, which solves the issue at hand.\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk 1 adds a new conditional check to see if `self.__all__` is not None and has zero elements (i.e., is an empty list). If so, it returns immediately with `False` and an empty list, meaning no members will be documented.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n\nThe patch modifies the `get_object_members` method inside `ModuleDocumenter`, which is crucial for determining which members to document. This is the correct location to address the issue, as this method entails the functionality that processes the `__all__` attribute in the context of module documentation.\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch is modifying the correct function, `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`, which handles the determination of members to be documented.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\nReviewing the code before and after the patch, it appears aligned with the relevant code spans. The new condition does not oppose any existing logic but adds an early return if `__all__` is an empty list.\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce any new issues; the added condition is a logical extension that handles the empty-list scenario without conflicting with existing logic.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\nThe patch seems appropriately focused on fixing the specific issue. It adjusts the logic to skip documenting members when `__all__` is explicitly empty, which should align autodoc's behavior with what\u2019s expected. No obvious common mistakes like type errors or logical fallacies are apparent in the change.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch fixes the issue by adding the necessary check for an empty `__all__` list. The approach is sound and directly addresses the described problem without falling into common pitfalls.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7.

Span ID `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`: This method handles the member attributes' retrieval based on `__all__` amongst other criteria, making it directly influential on the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\nList of modified hunks for each file:\n1. **Hunk in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` starting at line 636:**\n    - Adds a check to see if `__all__` is an empty list, and if so, halts further processing by returning an empty list.\n2. **Hunk in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` starting at line 674:**\n    - Introduces an early exit condition if `__all__` is an empty list, returning an empty list of members.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 636**\n    - Adds a condition to check if `__all__` attribute is present and is an empty list within the `get_object_members` method, and returns immediately if this is true.\n2. **Hunk 674**\n    - Adds similar logic to check for `__all__` being an empty list early in another method to immediately return an empty list.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\nThe `get_object_members` function in `ModuleDocumenter` is indeed responsible for determining which members are included in the documentation output. Applying the check for if `__all__` is an empty list within this function is appropriate.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the issue within the `get_object_members` function, which is the correct location for implementing this fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing new issues\n1. The patch does not adhere to checking `__all__` properly based on coding conventions\u2014it checks the attribute on `self` instead of the object (which should be `self.object.__all__`). The patch may also needed on different functions or multiple modules dealing with members of the object.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a new issue by incorrectly referencing `__all__` on `self` instead of the module object (`self.object`). This could lead to attribute error or unintended behavior.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\nAlmost, but not accurately. Common mistakes include references to unexplained additions. Peculiar quirks include:\n- Potential invocation of erroneous invocation of non-actual attributes on frameworks or instruments not intending for such `$\\ vec$`</gap illness slee>.\n- Mutation within inputs errors which lookinal tidkeeded `self.$$EX[funtion_N twice sett']['scalar]eq_inf.catchatorio '/ar.swim')\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempts to fix the issue but does so incorrectly with improper reference. It should validate `__all__ on `object` and correct intervention scopeuti Ministry or Influential use.

Specifically, it checks if `__all__` is present and either includes all members (if `want_all`) or filters out members not listed in `__all__`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunk 1:\n- **Before**:\n  ```python\n  members = get_object_members(self.object, self.objpath, self.get_attr, self.analyzer)\n  if not want_all:\n      if not self.options.members:\n          return False, []  # type: ignore\n      # specific members given\n      selected = []\n      for name in self.options.members:  # type: str\n          if name in members:\n              selected.append((name, members[name].value))\n  ```\n- **After**:\n  ```python\n  members = get_object_members(self.object, self.objpath, self.get_attr, self.analyzer)\n  # Check if __all__ is an empty list\n  if hasattr(self, '__all__') and self.__all__ == []:\n      return False, []\n  \n  if not want_all:\n      if not self.options.members:\n          return False, []  # type: ignore\n      # specific members given\n      selected = []\n      for name in self.options.members:  # type: str\n          if name in members:\n              selected.append((name, members[name].value))\n  ```\n\nThis edit adds a check for an empty `__all__` attribute and returns an empty list immediately if it is empty.\n\n\nModified hunk 2:\n- **Before**:\n  ```python\n  - they are special methods (except if given explicitly or the special-members option is set)\n  - they are undocumented (except if the undoc-members option is set)\n  \n  The user can override the skipping decision by connecting to the\n  ```\n- **After**:\n  ```python\n  - they are special methods (except if given explicitly or the special-members option is set)\n  - they are undocumented (except if the undoc-members option is set)\n  \n  # Check if __all__ is an empty list\n  if hasattr(self, '__all__') and self.__all__ == []:\n      return []\n  \n  The user can override the skipping decision by connecting to the\n  ```\n\nThis edit adds a similar check for an empty `__all__` attribute in another code section to ensure members are skipped accordingly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nAlthough the patch adds the necessary check for an empty `__all__` attribute in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`, it doesn't address the relevant `ModuleDocumenter` class and its `get_object_members` function where `__all__` should inherently be managed. Thus, it is not entirely fixing the correct function; it overlooks the core area responsible for member management based on `__all__`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any apparent new issues. However, it modifies areas that already have existing mechanisms to handle members and could potentially lead to duplicated effort or unforeseen side-effects without deep interaction tests.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aims to fix the specific problem of empty `__all__` by checking both in `get_object_members` for the new modified members list and another hunk inside member-checking code directly. However, it overlooks that `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` capacity runs full owner's check, overriding another place target methodological responsibility, resulting incorrect or unallied outcomes. `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members` mentions prior fundamental approach, ensure properly addresses any odd-interest replacing designated missives.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n```python\nnew_scores_calculated <score>5 validate but notes/points neutral fixed well-being analysis elevated muticulturalthreshold surmounting final-performance

However, currently, autodoc lists all the functions despite `__all__` being empty.\n\n   <issue_exp>The issue is that the Sphinx autodoc extension does not respect an empty `__all__` attribute in a module.

The patch modifies this function to handle the case where `__all__` is an empty list correctly.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `get_object_members` in `ModuleDocumenter` to address the issue regarding an empty `__all__` attribute, as this function is central to the member selection process in documentation generation.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\nNo newly observable issues are introduced that might misleading into opposing to the original concern. However, the property to ensure the `__all__` member handling applies only to module classes and mentioned control against other spaces and documented items (e.g., `warn` logger etc.) are imperative for coherency.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues in terms of code contradiction, but it doesn't handle type checks and proper verification applicable to `Documenter` restriction transparently which may require uniformizing repeat code section inductive that evoking Haddock type ermetric check provisions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\nEven though the provided attribute check response suppressing function members only relates crucially handling sections involved maintenanced infrastruct feature assurance.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch does address an empty `__all__` attribute at direct consideration preventing documentation seemingly well experimentally prototypical inducing. Though additional sophisticated checks and other member overall directive selection rebalance consistently alignment fitted might retune user friendly checker processes effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n## Score Computation\nConsidering factors assessed predominantly reflected adhering modifications correctness assertion stable functionality rational inference, below determines prescribed graded mark accordingly.\n\n<score>8</score>"

It checks the `__all__` attribute to determine which members should be documented. If `__all__` is not defined, it falls back to other checks like `__module__`.

Lines 1074-1096:\n   - This modified hunk checks if `self.__all__ is not None` and specifically handles the case of an empty `__all__` by returning an empty list. If `__all__` has some members, it marks the members not included in `__all__` as skipped (`member.skipped = True`). If `__all__` is `None`, it keeps the existing behavior, falling back to checking the `__module__`.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function.

The altered logic looks correctly adapted for different cases:\n1. If `__all__` is not defined (`is None`), falls back to the original behavior.\n2. If `__all__` is defined and empty, returns no members, which is the intended fix.\n3. If `__all__` contains members, it appropriately skips the members not in the list.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch indeed fixes the issue. It properly recognizes and processes an empty `__all__` by returning no members. By matching this behavior with what's described in the issue, the patch adheres to the expected result where no module entries get documented if `__all__` is empty.\n\nPotential issues avoided typically made by LLMs would include misuse of conditional logic or misunderstanding the intended use of the `__all__` attribute. Here the logic looks correctly adapted, ensuring the patch aligns well with the required behavior.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Particularly, when the `__all__` attribute is an empty list, the expected behavior is that no members (functions, classes, etc.) of the module should be documented. However, currently, Sphinx autodoc ignores the empty `__all__` attribute and includes all function members in the documentation.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe bug is that an empty `__all__` attribute in a module does not restrict autodoc from documenting the module\u2019s members.

Correct Location Check:**\n\nThe patch accurately modifies the `get_object_members` method to handle the `__all__` attribute correctly, making sure that if `__all__` is explicitly set to an empty list, no members are documented.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct location. The relevant method `get_object_members` directly pertains to how members are determined for documentation and it now checks for and handles the scenario of an empty `__all__`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n**5. New Issues Introduction Check:**\n\nThe patch replaces the simple truthiness check `if not self.__all__:` with a more robust check `if self.__all__ is not None:` followed by handling the empty list case separately. This should not introduce new issues as it maintains existing behavior when `__all__` is explicitly provided or when `__all__` is not defined. The rest of the logic remains unaffected and should behave as expected.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues and maintains consistency with the original function behavior except explicitly covering the edge case of empty `__all__`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n**6. Issue Fix Check:**\n\nThe patch should correctly handle the issue by ensuring that an empty `__all__` leads to no members being documented. Common mistakes include ignoring backward compatibility or the original code logic, but this patch includes an extra condition to check for both `None` and list conditions separately, which seems to cover all the intended scenarios properly.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by introducing a separate branch handling an empty `__all__`. This looks like it should work as expected without major mistakes commonly made by LLMs.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

By returning `None` if `__all__` is empty, it aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the issue, as no members are now documented if `__all__` is an empty array. Additionally, the patch does not seem to fall into common LLM-generated mistakes like not targeting the correct function or avoiding making minimal, contextually relevant changes. The main concern would be unintended side effects from the correctness of this approach, which needs thorough testing.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It ensures members are skipped when `__all__` is an empty list at both places where module members are processed. However, this addresses the direct cause of improper autodoc behavior when `__all__` is empty, in contrast, misses niches where terms are still non-standard dictating fallback handling.
