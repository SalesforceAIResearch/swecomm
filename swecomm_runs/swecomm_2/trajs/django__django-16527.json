Currently, this button is displayed based only on certain conditions: it should not appear in a popup, the user needs change permissions, and specific states of `change` and `save_as` flags. However, in the scenario where an add operation is being performed, it should also check if the user has add permissions. The absence of this permission check could lead to potential security issues or undesired behavior in the admin interface.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nsubmit_row\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code span with span_id \"submit_row\" is relevant because the definition of the \"show_save_as_new\" button is located within this function.

The `submit_row` function in the `admin_modify` module is indeed supposed to handle the visibility of the \"show_save_as_new\" button.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It correctly includes an extra check for `has_add_permission` without disrupting the logic of `submit_row`. There are no contradictions between the identified code spans and the patch.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by adding the `has_add_permission` requirement. This additional check ensures that users must have add permissions to see the \"show_save_as_new\" button, aligning with the intent described in the issue.\n\nChecking the generated patch against common mistakes made by LLMs, it does not seem to exhibit any:\n- The patch correctly includes necessary and sufficient conditions without producing any redundant or overwritten checks.\n- Syntax and formatting match the contextual coding standards.\n\nThus, the patch does fix the issue as intended.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It includes definitions for other permissions and handles the conditions under which different actions (like save, delete) can be performed. The mentioned lines include context checks for \"show_save_as_new\" where the omission of the \"has_add_permission\" check exists, making it directly relevant to the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk from lines 94-113 in `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk introduces an additional permission check for \"has_add_permission\" within the existing conditions for displaying \"show_save_as_new\" in \"submit_row\" method:\n1. **Before the patch:**\n   - The condition for \"show_save_as_new\" lacked the \"has_add_permission\" check. Only \"not is_popup\", \"has_change_permission\", \"change\" and \"save_as\" were checked.\n\n2. **After the patch:**\n   - The new addition checks \"has_add_permission\" along with the previously existing conditions, ensuring that \"show_save_as_new\" will only be shown if the user also has add permissions.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modification is placed inside the \"submit_row\" function which is responsible for generating the context object containing the conditions under which various action buttons, including \"show_save_as_new\", are shown.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues as it purely adds the required permission check \"has_add_permission\" for \"show_save_as_new\". Since the check is explicitly introduced as described, it should align well with the other context permission checks. No contradictions with other identified code spans were found.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by adding the critical check for \"has_add_permission\" to the context condition for \"show_save_as_new\". This aligns with the reported issue details and the permission logic already present, thus effectively fixing the described permission oversight in the \"show_save_as_new\" tag.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score:**\n\n<score>10</score>"

The change introduces an additional check for the `has_add_permission` attribute: the check ensures that the \"Save as new\" button will only display if the user has permission to add records (`has_add_permission`). The other existing conditions (`not is_popup`, `has_change_permission`, `change`, and `save_as`) remain unchanged. The update also includes inline comments for additional clarity.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly fixes the `submit_row` function, which is responsible for handling button visibility in the Django admin interface. The relevant code related to the \"show_save_as_new\" button is appropriately modified.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### 5. Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe submitted patch faithfully introduces the required additional permission check for the \"show_save_as_new\" button without conflicting with any existing conditions in the identified code span. Additionally, inline comments provide clarity without affecting functionality. Therefore, no new issues have been introduced by the patch.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by including the required `has_add_permission` check in the existing conditions for displaying the \"Save as new\" button (`show_save_as_new`) within the `submit_row` function. The correction ensures that users must have add permission to utilize the \"Save as new\" functionality, accurately fixing the reported issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n#### 7.
