And the symmetrical=False is an outdated requirement to recursive relationships with intermediary model to self, not required since 3.0. I'll provide a PR with a proposed correction shortly after.\nEdit: fixed description.\n\n</issue_description>\n\n**Explanation:**\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue relates to an incorrect hint message in Django when dealing with intermediary models for many-to-many (m2m) relationships with more than two ForeignKey fields and without specifying `through_fields`. The existing hint suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical` and `through` arguments, which is incorrect. These arguments are for `ManyToManyField`, not `ForeignKey`.

Instead, these are relevant to ManyToManyField.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nList of span ids:\n1. ManyToManyField\n2. ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model\n\nExplanation:\n- The span with id `ManyToManyField` gives context and defines the ManyToManyField class along with its properties.\n- The span with id `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model` implements the logic for validating relationship models used in the fields. This method is directly linked to the creation of relevant error messages and hints, and thus, very relevant to the issue at hand.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in file `related.py` at starting line 1303\n2. Modification in file `related.py` at starting line 1323\n\nExplanation:\n- In the first modification block, the error generating logic's hint initially suggested using arguments inside ForeignKey. The patch corrected this part by replacing `ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\")` with `ManyToManyField(\"%s\", through=\"%s\")`.\n- Similarly, the second modification block changed the hint provided for another case from `ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\")` to `ManyToManyField(\"%s\", through=\"%s\")` indicating the proper use consistent with many-to-many relationships.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct function pertaining to the issue.

This resolves the confusion where incorrect API keywords were suggested for fundamentally different field types. \n\nClosely aligning with the identified code spans ensures the logic for hint generation and ManyToManyField properties maintains consistency:\n1. Repetition: The patch doesn't contribute repetitive logic but correctly aligns with two error cases initially set.\n2. Incorrect API usage: Rectifies wrong arguments instead of introducing non-conformant parts or overlooked aspects.\n3. Edge Cases: Observes edge conditions pertinent to self-referential and intermediary relationship hints cleanly.\n\nA slight deduction could stem purely from the generating logic treating self-referential ManyToManyField hints uniformly; otherwise, it targets issue-consistent fixes alignment programmatically.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
