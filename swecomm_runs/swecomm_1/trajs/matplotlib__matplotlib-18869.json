Incorrect API Usage: The use of the `split` function and integer conversion generally seems correct, but the check for each part with `isdigit()` could be fragile if the version string includes beta or RC tags (like `3.1.0b1` or '4.2.1-rc1'). It filters out those segments, which changes the length.\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: Generally implements what is requested, but small edge cases like non-integer (`'2.0.0b1'` may break without interpreting pre-releases).\n\nHence, there are minor overlooks but it structurally meets the request and makes logical computational additions without significant contradictions..\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>9</score>"

The existing implementation works in tandem with the dynamic nature of `__version__` retrieval.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Proper methods (like string splitting and iteration for converting parts to integers) seem correctly used. The patch does not suggest misuse of any import or API.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: One potential edge case regarding non-numeric parts in the version (like 'beta', 'alpha') has been managed by filtering out non-digit parts.\n\nOverall, the patch seems adequate for the targeted issue.\n\nAlthough, additional consideration might be necessary for sanitizing initialization and usage of `version_info` and ensuring condition divergence if there was overlap with other possible version nomenclature discuss specific to Matplotlib (least probability observed).\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The patch does consider edge cases pragmatically by excluding non-numeric parts. Though the \u201ccommon mistakes\u201d margins are slightly touched by not using the `parse_version`, it's an acceptable design.

If `__version_info__` is accessed, a deprecation warning is raised, and the `_parse_to_version_info` function is used to get a version tuple.\n   - New function `_parse_to_version_info` (`lines 174-236`) is introduced, which converts a version string to a tuple for easy comparison.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch is modifying the `__getattr__` method appropriately to handle retrieval of `__version_info__`.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch doesn't introduce any contradictory issues with the visible code spans. However, there are a few things that can be enhanced such as the conversion logic inside `_parse_to_version_info`. The check for `v.pre[0] != 'rc'` is not very robust if there are other candidates like alpha, beta, etc.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n   **Review against common mistakes:**\n   - **Repetitive code**: The code structure looks appropriate and doesn't seem repetitious.\n   - **Incorrect API usage**: The usage of `packaging.version.Version` seems correct.\n   - **Overlooking edge cases**: The edge cases regarding version strings having 'rc', 'dev' and 'post-releases' seem mostly handled but could be better verified and handled more gracefully.\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch resolves the described issue by providing an easy method to convert and retrieve version info as a tuple. Traditional comparisons will indeed become easier with the `version_info` attribute. The deprecation warning for `__version_info__` is appropriate and encourages the use of the new method directly. \n   However, perfection isn't yet achieved\u2014There's some brittleness in version string parsing not fully accounting for all variations, which warrants further edge case testing and refinement.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Modification in the `__getattr__` function to handle `__version_info__`.\n2. Addition of the `_parse_to_version_info` function.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. First modified hunk:\n   - Handles `name == \"__version_info__\"` in the `__getattr__` function.\n   - Imports `warnings` and provides a deprecation warning for direct access to `__version_info__`.\n   - Deprecated usage points to `_parse_to_version_info(__version__)`.\n   - Raises `AttributeError` for other attributes.\n\n2. Second modified hunk:\n   - Introduces a new function, `_parse_to_version_info`, which converts a version string to a tuple for easier comparisons, using the `packaging.version` module.\n   - Handles various forms of version strings: final, pre-release (including `rc`), post-release, and dev releases, converting them into a unified tuple format.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `__getattr__` function to handle the new attribute `__version_info__`, which is appropriate because `__getattr__` manages dynamic attribute access and versions are indeed an attribute. The right function is being amended to include a new version attribute.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo glaring new issues are introduced in the sense of syntax or runtime errors. The integration respects existing encapsulations by centralizing version-related attributes within `__getattr__`. Every essential case such as `pre-release`, `dev`, `post-release`, and final version schemes are either accounted for or appropriately handled by `_parse_to_version_info`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the patch can fix the issue**:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive code**: No major repetitions observed.\n- **Incorrect API usage**: Usage of `packaging.version.Version` appears correct allowing detailed parsing of version strings.\n- **Overlooking edge cases**: The `_parse_to_version_info` function seems comprehensive, handling plausible edge case scenarios for version strings well enough.\n\nThe patch provides a solution that's legitimate for encapsulating and decomposing version information, aligning with broadly employed versioning standards while avoiding known pitfalls, such as possible version number parsing issues.\nThe approach taken addresses the raised issue properly by creating a new `__version_info__` access method and backr mobile supervisor-librarily utilizing a more informative version format.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
