If these conditions are met, it returns `False`, ensuring that module pages are not generated for EPUB when the configuration is disabled.\n   \n   ```diff\n   +     builder_name = app.builder.name\n   +     if builder_name.startswith('epub') and not app.config.viewcode_enable_epub:\n   +         return False\n   ```\n\n2. **Hunk 2: `collect_pages` function**\n   - **Original:** Creates module pages without checking for the EPUB builder.\n   - **Modified:** Adds a check if the builder is for EPUB and if `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`. If these conditions are met, it returns early, avoiding the generation of module pages for EPUB.\n\n   ```diff\n   +     if app.builder.name.startswith('epub') and not app.config.viewcode_enable_epub:\n   +         return\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch targets the correct functions. It includes modifications in both `should_generate_module_page` and `collect_pages` functions to check for the EPUB builder and prevent the generation of module pages when `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`. This aligns with the expected behavior as described in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introduction of New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The added conditions properly check for the EPUB builder and respect the `viewcode_enable_epub` configuration. Additionally, the logic change is simple and contained, minimizing the risk of side effects.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Fixing the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue effectively:\n1. **Correct Function handling:** It modifies the correct functions to prevent module page generation for EPUB when disabled.\n2. **Overlooked Edge Cases:** The LLM includes edge case handling specific to the builder name and the configuration option.\n3. **Incorrect API Usage:** The API usage appears to be correct and consistent with the conventions in the existing codebase.\n4. **Repetitive Code:** The patch does not introduce repetitive logic but rather adds new conditions before existing functionality.\n\nOverall, the patch pursues a correct and complete fix for the described issue without violating the common error patterns.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\nBased on the criteria provided and the analysis, the patch is accurate, does not introduce new issues, and correctly fixes the problem described. Therefore, the high quality of the patch warrants a high score.\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the Issue\n\nThe issue revolves around the `viewcode` extension in Sphinx, which is creating pages for EPUB builds even when the configuration `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. The expected behavior is that no pages should be generated for EPUB when this setting is `False`.\n\nOutput:\n<issue_exp>The issue reports that the Sphinx `viewcode` extension creates pages for EPUB outputs regardless of the `viewcode_enable_epub=False` setting. The expected behavior when `make html epub` is run is that module pages should not be generated if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`, but currently, they are.</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of Span IDs:\n- `doctree_read`\n\nExplanation of each identified code span:\n- **doctree_read**: This function in the `viewcode` module checks for conditions to skip handling certain modules based on the configuration. It already has an early return for EPUB builders if `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. This is directly relevant as it shows a partial implementation which is likely being extended in other function(s).\n\nOutput:\n<code_span_exp>\n<span_id list>[doctree_read]</span_id>\n- **doctree_read**:\nThis function inspects and manipulates the document tree during the build process. It contains logic to possibly skip processing when certain conditions are met, especially for 'epub' builders with `viewcode_enable_epub` set to `False`. This suggests it handles functionality that's directly relevant to the issue at hand with `viewcode` for EPUB builds, giving insight into how the patch might address this condition in other relevant functions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nModified hunks list:\n1. Changes to `should_generate_module_page` function.\n2. Changes to the `collect_pages` function.\n\nExplanation for each modified hunk:\n- **should_generate_module_page**: This change adds logic to early return `False` if the builder name starts with 'epub' and `viewcode_enable_epub` is disabled in the configuration.\n- **collect_pages**: This change adds logic at the beginning of the function to early return if the builder name starts with 'epub' and `viewcode_enable_epub` is disabled.\n\nOutput:\n<patch_exp>\n<hunk list>\n1. should_generate_module_page modifications\n2. collect_pages modifications\n</hunk list>\n- **should_generate_module_page**:\nAdds an early return `False` if the current builder is for EPUB and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.

This halts further page collection and processing for EPUB builds when the config is explicitly disabled.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\nThe candidate patch introduces checks specifically for handling the EPUB builders at the two points where the problem originates (infrastructure for deciding page generation).\n\nOutput:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, this patch addresses specific functions which control whether pages should be generated (`should_generate_module_page`) and collect pages (`collect_pages`).

This is problematic because the expected behavior is that no such pages should be generated by default when configured accordingly.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**\n   The identified code spans will help us understand which parts of the code are involved in generating viewcode pages for different output formats.\n\n   - List of span IDs: `doctree_read`\n\n   <code_span_exp>The identified code span `doctree_read` pertains to a function that reads the doctree and handles viewcode modules. It already contains logic to return early if the builder is of type EPUB and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`. This indicates that a place where viewcode generation for EPUB is controlled.</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n   The list of modified hunks in the candidate patch includes:\n   - A modification in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` between lines 177 and 194.\n\n   <patch_exp>The patch adds a conditional check in the `collect_pages` function. It will now return early if the builder's name starts with \"epub\" and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`. This guards against generating viewcode for EPUB output when the setting is disabled.</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check If the Patch Is Fixing the Correct Function**\n   <correct_location_exp>The patch is appropriately placed in the `collect_pages` function which is responsible for generating the viewcode pages. The conditional logic to exclude EPUB output aligns well with the logic found in the previously identified `doctree_read` function, verifying its correct location.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues or Contradictions**\n   <new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce new issues, and its logic aligns correctly with the already existing logic in the `doctree_read` function. There is no contradiction between the identified code spans and the patch. However, it would be cleaner to place both the checks (`return` on missing `_viewcode_modules` and builder condition) together.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check If Patch Can Fix the Issue**\n   - Repetitive Code: The patch is concise and does not introduce repetitive code.\n   - Incorrect API Usage: The patch correctly uses the existing API and structure.\n   - Overlooking Edge Cases: The patch potentially overlooks if `env.config.viewcode_enable_epub` is always present in all configurations, but this seems to be an accepted part of the API.\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>The patch correctly addresses the problem by adding a necessary condition to prevent EPUB viewcode pages from being generated when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`. The check seems optimal and correctly integrated without introducing repetitive or incorrect code.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
