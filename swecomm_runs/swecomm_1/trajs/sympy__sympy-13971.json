This rendering does not translate well when the output is copied into a markdown cell as the backslashes make it incorrect for direct rendering outside of LaTeX recognition context. The expected result is to have unescaped square brackets like `\\left[` and `\\right]`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n- spandas = ['LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula']\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula` is relevant because it's the method that handles the printing of `SeqFormula` to its LaTeX string representation. Specifically, the part of the code that decides how the brackets around the sequence are formed (using `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]`) is directly related to the problem described in the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understanding the candidate patch:\n- modified_hunks = [('a/sympy/printing/latex.py', 'b/sympy/printing/latex.py', 'lines 1650-1660')]\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch changes the output of the `SeqFormula` from using backslash-escaped square brackets `\\left\\[` and `\\right\\]` to unescaped square brackets. It specifically modifies the strings on lines 1658 and 1660 from `r\"\\left\\[\"` to `r\"\\left[\"` and from `r\"\\right\\]\"` to `r\"\\right]\"` to meet the desired output without backslashes.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The issue is specifically with how `SeqFormula` is rendered into LaTeX, and the `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula` method is indeed where this rendering happens.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce contradictory changes relative to the identified code spans. However, it is important to ensure that this modification aligns with how all consumers of the printed LaTeX output expect the brackets to appear. Given that this change only removes the escaping for square brackets and maintains other formatting like `\\left` and `\\right`, it should not adversely affect those consuming the LaTeX output for rendering.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch should fix the main issue as described since it correctly modifies the escape characters for the brackets, which aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the issue. The patch avoids repetitive code, makes the right API changes, and appears to handle the main edge case presented by sequences rendering. While the change is straightforward, it's important to test in various environments to confirm no unintended consequences.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Currently, the sequence notation is rendered with backslash-escaped brackets (e.g., `\\left\\[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots\\right\\]`), which doesn't render correctly when copied to a markdown cell. The goal is to adjust how `SeqFormula` outputs its sequences to avoid backslash-escaping square brackets.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe relevant code spans include only one:\n1. LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula\n\nExplanation:\n- LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula (span_id: LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula): This code span defines how sequences (specifically `SeqFormula` objects) are printed in LaTeX representation.

This is precisely where the issue happens, as it is responsible for defining the LaTeX representation of sequences like `SeqFormula`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is not introducing new issues by itself. It simply removes the backslashes from the square brackets in the LaTeX output.

Repetitive code: The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The patch makes a minor change to an existing string, not invoking any new APIs that could be incorrectly used.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Removing a backslash is a small change and unlikely to impact other unconsidered edge cases in this context.\n\nOverall, the patch adheres to the requirements specified in the issue description, effectively fixing it without introducing errors or undesirable side effects.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Repetitive code: The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n2. Incorrect API usage: No incorrect usage of the API is noted, as the primary change is a simple string replacement.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Since the patch only modifies how brackets are displayed, it does not seem to affect other correctness issues related to the sequence rendering.\n\nThis patch effectively addresses the issue without falling into any common mistakes typically made by LLMs.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understanding the issue:\n```issue_exp\nThe issue is about the display format of a sequence generated by the `SeqFormula()` function in sympy when it is rendered in a Jupyter notebook. Currently, the output is backslash-escaped (`\\left\\[0, 1, 4, 9, \\ldots\\right\\]`), which does not render correctly when copied into a markdown cell. The goal is to modify this behavior so that square brackets are not backslash-escaped (i.e., `\\[ \\]` becomes `[ ]`).\n```\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\nList of span ids: \n- LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula\n\n```code_span_exp\nThe identified code span `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula` is a method that generates the LaTeX representation of a `SeqFormula` object. The method determines how the sequence is printed, including the use of the backslash-escaped square brackets which is the core issue at hand. This code span is directly responsible for how the sequence is displayed and thus is where the changes need to be applied.\n```\n\n3. Understanding the candidate patch:\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification from `r\"\\left\\[\"` to `r\"\\left[\"`\n2. Modification from `r\"\\right\\]\"` to `r\"\\right]\"`\n\n```patch_exp\n1. The first modified hunk changes `r\"\\left\\[\"` to `r\"\\left[\"` on line 1658. This removes the unnecessary backslash escape for the opening square bracket.\n2. The second modified hunk changes `r\"\\right\\]\"` to `r\"\\right]\"` on line 1660. This removes the unnecessary backslash escape for the closing square bracket.\n```\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n```correct_location_exp\nThe patch is indeed fixing the correct function. The output format of the sequence is managed by the `_print_SeqFormula` method, and the patch modifies it to ensure that the square brackets are not backslash-escaped. This corresponds with the relevant code span identified earlier.\n```\n\n5.

It makes minimal, precise changes to only the relevant parts that are responsible for the rendering issue. It does not contradict any of the identified code spans.\n```\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n```fix_issue_exp\nThe patch correctly addresses the specific issue mentioned. It ensures that the square brackets in the sequence output are not backslash-escaped, which aligns with the desired behavior specified in the issue description. This is a targeted and correct fix, avoiding common mistakes such as repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or overlooking edge cases.\n```        \n\n<score>9</score>"
