Original code line: 249-252 \n   - **Original code**:\n     ```python\n     if isinstance(tp, TensorProduct):\n         tp = tp._eval_expand_tensorproduct()\n     add_args.append(tp)\n     ```\n\n   - **Modified code**:\n     ```python\n     c_part, nc_part = tp.args_cnc()  # added\n     if len(nc_part) == 1 and isinstance(nc_part[0], TensorProduct):  # modified\n         nc_part = (nc_part[0]._eval_expand_tensorproduct(), )  # modified\n     add_args.append(Mul(*c_part) * Mul(*nc_part))  # modified\n     ```\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1**: The patch modifies the method `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` (lines 249-253), replacing the simple instance check of `TensorProduct` with:\n  1.

This is indeed the correct function that contains the logic to expand tensor products across addition.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch modifies the core logic significantly by breaking down the tensor product into commutative and non-commutative parts and then handling these separately. While the approach appears sound, there are some potential issues:\n1. The source code does not explicitly handle the edge cases described in the issue, such as when tensor parts are zeros.\n2. The nesting might introduce more complexity and risk in combinatorial multiplication logic that needs thorough testing.\nTherefore, here lie potential new issues: handling zero parts of the tensor and confirming combinatorial edge cases.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the incorrect check by clearly separating commutative and non-commutative parts within the tensor product to ensure thorough expansion. However, let's examine common LLM mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: The patch does not introduce repetition.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: It correctly uses `args_cnc()` for separating and `Mul()` for recombination. No obvious API misuse.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The patch may still potentially overlook scalar factors turning to zero after expansion; for instance, a case where a tensor's scalar factor causes a whole part to nullify isn't specially covered.\n\nIn conclusion, given these potential gaps, the patch might effectively handle part of the issue but possibly bypasses nested combinations clean handling and the case when the tensor factor becomes zero.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Scoring\n\n<score>7</score>"

This is done by:\n- Decomposing `tp` to separate commutative (`c_part`) and non-commutative (`nc_part`) parts using `args_cnc()`.\n- Checking if the non-commutative part contains a single `TensorProduct` instance, and if so, recursively expanding it.\n- Combining the commutative and expanded non-commutative parts back together with `Mul`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `TensorProduct._eval_expand_tensorproduct`, which is precisely where the issue arises.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues.

However, without broader context validations and more extensive tests, it's hard to be completely certain if there are no unforeseen side effects. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to address the problem stated in the issue by adding a more precise handle over the commutative and non-commutative parts. It avoids repetitive code, seems to use the correct API and methods (`args_cnc()`, `Mul`), and specifically tackles the edge case related to the commutative (scalar) factors.

This method is responsible for distributing `TensorProducts` across addition and is the locus where the incomplete expansion is occurring. The code span reveals how sub-expressions are structured and combined, which is crucial to understand the changes made to fix the expansion issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - hunk1: modification to the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch modifies the `_eval_expand_tensorproduct` method to handle cases where scalar (commutative) and non-commutative factors exist. \n- For entries in `args` that are instances of `Add`, it checks if within the `Add`, there are instances of `Mul` and separates their commutative (c_part) and non-commutative (nc_part) parts.\n- If the number of non-commutative parts is precisely one, it constructs a `TensorProduct` with these separated parts and recursively expands it.\n- The commutative part is then multiplied back with the expanded tensor product and added to the result `add_args`.\n- This check for non-commutative length and recursive processing is repeated many times redundantly.\n- Finally, based on whether there are add_args, it either returns the resultant additive `TensorProduct` or the instance itself.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct Location for the Fix**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch seems to be modifying the correct function, `_eval_expand_tensorproduct`, where the issue of incomplete expansion has been identified. The core logic concerning distribution of tensor products across additions is housed in this function.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introduction of New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch contains repetitive and redundant code segments. Specifically, the segment checking for `Mul` and non-commutative factor length is repeated multiple times, which may reduce efficiency and readability. Each of these sections performs the same check and operation without adding variation. This significantly clutters the code and can potentially introduce maintenance issues without additional functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking If the Patch Can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch targets the correct function and theoretically should fix the issue by handling products of scalars correctly, it introduces repetitive code unnecessarily. However, the repetitive code does seem to handle the separation and expansion of tensor products with scalars as intended.\nThe patch does correctly manage the breakdown and repeated proper handling of scalar factors, but a cleaner and less repetitive implementation would be more desirable. The correct API usage does seem respected, and the expression calculus is adequately adhered to.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>5</score>"

Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\n- There is significant repetitive code generated for checking if an argument is an instance of `Mul` and subsequently calling `args_cnc()` and expanding non-commutative parts. The repeated block of code is redundant and could decrease efficiency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6.

However, the repetition of logical blocks doesn't add much value \u2014 it could be streamlined into a loop or a helper function.\n\nThe code does seem to address the initial problem but does so in a potentially inefficient way.

However, the included repetitive logic highlights a lack of asymmetric refinement.\n   - Common mistakes:\n     1. **Repetitive code**: Multiple redundant blocks.\n     2. **Incorrect API usage**: Not directly apparent unless further debugging.\n     3. **Overlooking edge cases**: Comprehensive checking may still miss some corner cases due to the redundancy and possible overlooked scenarios.\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   While the patch aims at the correct logical fix by handling scalar multipliers separately, it falls into the common mistake category of having overly repetitive code. This can hinder proper execution and maintainability, and could potentially miss certain edge cases due to redundancy.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>2</score>"
