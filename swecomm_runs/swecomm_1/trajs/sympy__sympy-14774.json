                    "msg": "1. **Understanding the Issue**\n\n  - The issue is that the Latex printer for inverse trigonometric functions does not correctly support the `acsc` and `asec` functions when the `inv_trig_style` option is set to \"full\". Specifically, it returns `\\\\operatorname{acsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` instead of `\\\\operatorname{arccsc}{\\\\left (x \\\\right )}` for `acsc(x)` and an analogous output for `asec(x)`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue concerns the improper handling of the `acsc` and `asec` functions by the Latex printer when using the \"full\" inverse trigonometric function naming style. The printer returns an incorrect name for these functions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n\n  - **Span IDs**: \n    - LatexPrinter._print_Function\n\n<Comment>\n\n2. **Explanation of Relevance**\n\n  - **LatexPrinter._print_Function**: This code span contains logic for rendering functions to LaTeX, including how inverse trigonometric functions are displayed (`lines 715-782`), and includes `inv_trig_style` setting and inverse trig table (`lines 743-750`). The issue modification occurs at line 743 within this code span.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nLatexPrinter._print_Function: This span is directly relevant as it contains the `_print_Function` method responsible for how the inverse trigonometric functions are handled and displayed in LaTeX, including the configuration (through `inv_trig_style`) that needs to be fixed for acsc and asec functions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\n  - **Hunk #1**\n<comment>\n\n  This hunk modifies the content of `inv_trig_table` from:\n\n```\ninv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]\n```\n\nTo:\n\n```\ninv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]\n```\n\n  The effect is to add `acsc` and `asec` to the list of inverse trigonometric functions that the Latex printer recognizes and applies the styles to.\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk #1: Modifies the content of `inv_trig_table` at line 743 of `sympy/printing/latex.py`, extending it to include `acsc` and `asec` functions ensuring they receive the appropriate \"full\" inverse trigonometric function naming style.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check Fix Location**\n\n  \n  - The fix is in `_print_Function` at line 743 which is relevant as it's responsible and the correct location for setting the table of recognized inverse trig functions defined at line-743.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function as it modifies `_print_Function` where the `inv_trig_table` is defined at line 743. This definition governs whether specific inverse trigonometric functions like `asin`, `acos`, `acsc`, `asec`, etc., have styles applied to them.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues**\n\n  \nThe patch only modifies `inv_trig_table` ensuring `acsc` and `asec` are included among recognized inverse trigonometric functions, thus allowing altered correct styling under `latex`. This very specific change seems not substitutes he current code foundation or introduce  contradictions or thinking expressions within `_print_Function`.\n\nTherefore, observed in this patch would near to not seemingly any new appearing issues related.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo apparent new issues introduced. The patch correctly adds support for `acsc` and `asec` without conflicting notably contrary or irrational inconsistency to or with the rest of has been used code span within `._print_Function`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if Patch Fixes Exoranblement**\n\nBeyond overall a common-mill achievable issue scenario of span breaking hiatus or twice-conforming/leverage

While addressing repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or overlooking edge cases, there are none observed within the limited context provided.

Modified Hunk:\n- Original Code: `inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]`\n- Patched Code: `inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]`\n\nThis hunk of the patch aims to update the `inv_trig_table` to include `acsc` and `asec` in addition to the already existing inverse trigonometric functions.

It correctly identifies the missing functions (`acsc`, `asec`) and adds them to the `inv_trig_table`. This aligns the implementation with the stated functionality to support full inverse trigonometric names across all inverse trigonometric functions. The patch text is simple and concise, avoiding any repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or potential edge case oversights.
