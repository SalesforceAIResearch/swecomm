                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves pytest version 6.x not behaving the same way as version 5.x when dynamically adding an xfail marker to a test's request object. In pytest 5.x, using `request.node.add_marker(mark)` where mark is an xfail marker would treat failing tests as expected failures (XFAILED), whereas in pytest 6.x, this same code leads to the tests being treated as normal failures (FAILED) and throws an error.\n</issue_exp>\n\n**Identified Code Spans**\n1. `Node.add_marker`\n2. `pytest_runtest_makereport`\n3. `evaluate_xfail_marks`\n4. `pytest_runtest_setup`\n5. `pytest_runtest_call`\n6. `TestCaseFunction.addUnexpectedSuccess`\n7. `TestCaseFunction`\n8. `TestCaseFunction.addExpectedFailure`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **`Node.add_marker`:** This function dynamically appends a marker object to the node, and it is directly related to the issue because the dynamic addition of the xfail marker is leading to unexpected behavior.\n2. **`pytest_runtest_makereport`:** This function processes the test's outcome after its execution. The handling of test outcomes like unexpected success or failure, as well as xfailed and skipped outcomes are managed here. It's relevant because it affects how dynamically added markers influence test reporting.\n3. **`evaluate_xfail_marks`:** This function evaluates if a test item has any xfail markers. It's fundamental to the resolution of the issue as the check of dynamic xfail markers needs to be accurately addressed. This function is key to determining how tests with xfail markers are dealt with.\n4. **`pytest_runtest_setup`:** This span includes code that resets the skipping and xfail markers before each test setup. This context is directly targeted to assess and appropriately connect how dynamic markers should be reassigned.\n5. **`pytest_runtest_call`:** This span contains code that evaluates and enforces xfail markers precisely when the test is called. This influences how newly added markers via add_marker are executed when the test runs.\n6. **`TestCaseFunction.addUnexpectedSuccess`:** This function manages unexpected successes during test cases and is indirectly related in ensuring corner cases while dynamically adding xfail markers are handled.\n7. **`TestCaseFunction`:** The wrapper class around test calling functions, potentially impacting how test cases with dynamically added markers interact during executions.\n8. **`TestCaseFunction.addExpectedFailure`:** Similar to unexpected success, this function intervenes on expected failures for test cases which include evaluations related to dynamically adding xfail.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Curate Modified Hunks**\n1.

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the issue**:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about a change in the behavior of pytest from version 5.x to 6.x. In version 5.x, adding an `xfail` marker dynamically using `request.node.add_marker(mark)` would treat the failing test as expected (xfail). However, in version 6.0.0rc0, adding an `xfail` marker this way raises an assertion error, causing the test to fail rather than be marked as expected to fail.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**:\n\n- List of span ids: `Node.add_marker`, `pytest_runtest_makereport`, `evaluate_xfail_marks`, `pytest_runtest_setup`, `pytest_runtest_call`, `TestCaseFunction.addUnexpectedSuccess`, `TestCaseFunction`, `TestCaseFunction.addExpectedFailure`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Node.add_marker**: This code serves to add markers (like `xfail`) dynamically to nodes.

Remove line `xfailed_key = StoreKey[Optional[Xfail]]()`\n2. Remove line `unexpectedsuccess_key = StoreKey[str]()`\n3. Modify lines in the `pytest_runtest_setup` function.\n4. Modify lines in the `pytest_runtest_call` function.\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Hunk 1:** \n```python\nxfailed_key = StoreKey[Optional[Xfail]]()\nunexpectedsuccess_key = StoreKey[str]()\n```\nThese lines define store keys to store whether a test is marked as `xfail` or has unexpected success, respectively.\n\n2. **Hunk 2 within pytest_runtest_setup**\u2014Adds comments and reorders some logic:\n    Ligne 243-245: Retrieve `xfailed` and store it in `item._store`.\n    Line 250: Check if `xfailed` run flag is set to False.\n\n3. **Hunk 3 within pytest_runtest_call**\u2014Improves loading/storing within `item._store`:\n    Line 256-257: Sets the retrieved `xfailed` back to `item._store`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Checking the Correctness of the Function Being Patched\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the correct functions\u2014`pytest_runtest_setup` and `pytest_runtest_call`, which are responsible for handling the setup and call stages of tests. These functions handle the `xfail` logic and are the appropriate locations for the proposed changes.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Introducing New Issues\n\nChecking for new issues or contradictions:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce blatant new issues or logical contradictions from the identified code spans. It focuses on ensuring `xfail` is properly stored and accessed in the `item._store`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n\nCommon Mistakes Check:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive Code:** No repetition was introduced.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** The modified code does not misuse pytest's marking API.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** The patch reinforces proper loading/storing of runtime-markers like `xfail`.\n\nOverall, the code dynamically manages and correctly utilizes the pytest internal mechanisms for xfails, thus fixing the dynamic addition of `xfail` markers.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
