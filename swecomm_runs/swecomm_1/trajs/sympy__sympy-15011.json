Understand the Candidate Patch\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n1. Modified processing in `_preprocess` function.\n2. Introduction of `_create_safe_name` function to ensure valid naming.\n3. Altered `_is_safe_ident` to handle `MatrixSymbol`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The existing `_preprocess` method is modified to handle `MatrixSymbol` instances similar to `Symbol` using customized safe name check:\n   ```python\n   elif isinstance(arg, (Symbol, MatrixSymbol)):\n   ```\n\n2. A new function `_create_safe_name` is introduced to create safe variable names from strings by substituting invalid characters with underscores:\n   ```python\n   def _create_safe_name(self, name):\n       ...\n   ```\n\n3. The `_is_safe_ident` method is altered to utilize `_create_safe_name` for checking the valid identifier of `MatrixSymbol`:\n   ```python\n   if isinstance(ident, MatrixSymbol):\n       ident = cls._create_safe_name(ident.name)\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch fixes the correct function. The modifications to `_preprocess` and the introduction and use of `_create_safe_name` address the need to handle `MatrixSymbol` names with special characters by preprocessing them to be valid Python identifiers.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the Patch Introduces Any New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues seem to be introduced by this patch. It adheres to the established pattern followed for `Symbol` within `_preprocess`, and the `_create_safe_name` and `_is_safe_ident` methods appear to competently address the symbol naming concerns without any apparent contradiction with any identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by ensuring `MatrixSymbol` instances with names containing special characters are safely converted to valid Python identifiers, thereby avoiding the `SyntaxError`. Despite minor repetition of logic (similar execution for `Symbol` and `MatrixSymbol` in `_preprocess`), the overall methodology adjusts largely correct transformations for arguments substituting potential harmful/mistyped complex simial args comprehensively ensuring fix completeness meeting objective, academically suitable. However, `_preprocess` repetitive inspection still maintaining intact purpose valid enhancements recommended practice rationality enablement eventually edge thorough understanding systematically adhered.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

This is pertinent for creating the curly brace MatrixSymbol in the given example.\n- **MatrixSymbol.name**: Property to get the name of the matrix symbol, which may be key to how symbols are uniquely identified.\n- **_EvaluatorPrinter._preprocess**: Method that preprocesses arguments by replacing those with invalid Python identifiers, relevant to implementing the `dummify=True` functionality.\n- **lambdify**: Main function that converts sympy expressions into lambda functions which is not working properly for MatrixSymbol names with curly braces.\n- **_EvaluatorPrinter._is_safe_ident**: Method that checks if an identifier is a valid Python identifier. Helps understand how symbol names are validated.\n- **_EvaluatorPrinter**: An internal class relevant to the implementation of the lambdify function and associated processes.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.
