Understanding how this class works or what it encompasses is crucial for determining the pickle issue.\n3. **Figure.__getstate__**: This method in the `Figure` class shows how the state of a `Figure` object is serialized for pickling. It highlights that certain attributes, including the canvas, are removed before the object is serialized, perhaps to avoid pickling errors.

The state manipulation in `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` is consistent and directly corrects the referential issues for `_draggable`.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: There does not appear to be any incorrect API usage; it correctly uses the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` protocols to handle pickling. It\u2019s aligned with Python\u2019s pickling system.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The edge case where `set_draggable` needs specific parameters (`use_blit`, `update`) can be overlooked if those parameters differ when toggling the draggability.

Legend.set_draggable\n\n- FigureCanvasQTAgg: This span indicates where the FigureCanvasQTAgg class is defined, which is relevant as pickling errors can be related to the figure's canvas component.\n- Figure.__getstate__: This method is responsible for serializing the state of a figure, crucial for saving (pickling) the figure's state. Understanding its workings is essential for diagnosing and potentially modifying behavior to handle draggable legends.\n- Legend.set_draggable: This method sets the legend's draggable state, tied to the issue at hand since enabling the draggable legend leads to a pickling error. \n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunk: Changes in `lib/matplotlib/legend.py` file\n   - Introduces two methods, `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` of Legend class.\n   - `__getstate__` copies the legend's state and modifies `_draggable`. \n     Also removes `_draggable` from the state before pickling.\n   - `__setstate__` sets `_draggable` back when unpickling. Depending on the state of `_draggable` being True, it calls `set_draggable(True)`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is made in the correct location. It modifies the `Legend` class to patch the pickling process of the draggable legend since this is directly related to the problem described in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch addresses the pickling issue effectively without conflicting directly with other identified spans. No new run-time issues are identified.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch introduces methods that handle pickling the `draggable` property. It solves the issue without repetition, making the legend pickleable by managing `_draggable`. There are no incorrect API usages.\n\nHowever, the solution might have minor edge case concerns (e.g., with mixed backends), but fundamentally, it fits within the highlighted categories and provides a pragmatic fix.\n\nGiven all these factors, the approach seems valid as there are no apparent logical or syntax pitfalls.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

However, the patch doesn't test other potential edge cases around more complex legend configurations, though it does follow Core Python\u2019s protocol for custom objintosh pickling which is a good approach. There don't seem to be any repetitive code snippets within the patch, and the existing API usage appears correct. The patch correctly addresses the primary root cause of the issue, aligning with sufficiently implemented methods within `Legend` that seem tailored to this specific issue and fitting within the class\u2019s existing framework.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Repetitive Code: The management of the `_draggable` state is now duplicated, in both `__getstate__` and `set_draggable`.\n2. Overlooking Edge Cases: The insufficiency to preserve `use_blit` and `update` parameters can result in insecure usage if these are required to remain synchronized.\n3. Introducing New Issues: Reinstantiating `_draggable` without preserving properties beyond its boolean existence could lead to subtle bugs.\n\nGiven these considerations, the patch partially resolves the problem but creates nuances that could regress functionality elsewhere around the draggable legends.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>4</score>"

It handles the creation and cleanup of the draggable state, which is relevant because modifying this to work with pickling is part of the solution.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of Modified Hunks:\n- Hunk 1: Modify the legend.py to include methods `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` to handle the draggable property during pickling.\n\nExplanation:\n- **Legend Class:** Adds `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods. The `__getstate__` method saves the draggable attribute and removes it from the state dictionary if present. The `__setstate__` method restores the draggable attribute and calls `set_draggable` on the legend object based on the saved state.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the addition of the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods in the Legend class appears to be fixing the correct function since the issue revolves around the draggable attribute of legends causing the pickling to fail.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not directly contradict any identified code spans, but it's essential to confirm the modified code does not introduce issues. Issues potentially can be:\n- New or edge case bugs due to inappropriate restoration of draggability on unpickling.\n- Avoid suppressing/missing the draggable information during the pickling process erroneously, potentially affecting other legend functionalities.\nDispatching set_draggable() blindly with picked state might introduce unexpected behaviors for unpickled objects.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive Code:** The patch doesn't repeat logic excessively.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** No signs of incorrect API usage in the provided focal class Legend's code after the introspect.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Handling '_draggable' in `__getstate__` and calling `set_draggable` based on '_draggable' truthiness addresses the broadest case but might miss intricate bugs after full landscape operation post-unpickling.\n\nCorrectly targets needed methods to manage state and specify correcting the job it purports.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It\u2019s relevant because additional non-picklable information might be causing the error.\n3. `Legend.set_draggable`: This method is responsible for making legends draggable in the plot.

The logic looks correct now since it's common practice to handle non-picklable fields in this specialty.\n\nHowever, to ensure thoroughness:\n1. There could still be more attributes that are not picklable but are necessary for this context, apart from `canvas`, `cids`, and `_c1`.\n2. We have to ensure that similar `draggable` classes, aside from `DraggableBase`, do not override this behavior inadvertently.\n\nOverall, the tweaking handles the initial problem but make sure that altering significant components involving API conventions does harmonize.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Thus, in context, it appears the edge cases regarding non-picklable attributes are managed.\n\nTherefore, the patch adequately addresses the issue reported, allowing figures with draggable legends to be pickled successfully by excluding problematic attributes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
