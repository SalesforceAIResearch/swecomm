Repetitive Code: The repetition of `\"unit_attr=\"units\"` represents some duplication in code but isn\u2019t functionally wrong in this context.\n2. Incorrect API usage: There's no visible mishandling of API as the `attrs.get` method of retrieving units integrates correctly.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: The provision for `unit_attr` accounts for both the presence and absence of units, making it relatively broad.\n\nHowever, the misplacement and repetition might still be an optimization or refactoring concern. \nTherefore, the patch implements the intention of showing units correctly.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\nConsidering reasonable adherence to the functional improvement request, balanced with few concerns on code efficiency without disqualifying functional correctness:\n\n<score>7</score>"
