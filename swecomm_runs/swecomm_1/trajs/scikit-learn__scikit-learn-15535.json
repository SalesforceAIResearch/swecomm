                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue concerns a regression in the input validation of clustering metrics in `sklearn`. Specifically, there is an inconsistency in handling string labels with `mutual_info_score`. While passing a numpy array with object dtype containing string labels throws a ValueError, using an array without the `astype(object)` call generates only a warning. This inconsistency has led to disruptions for users who experienced no such warnings or errors in version 0.21.1.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n[\"contingency_matrix\", \"mutual_info_score\", \"check_array\"]\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **contingency_matrix**: This function creates a contingency matrix from true and predicted labels, assuming labels are integers. The issue arises when non-integer (specifically string) labels are provided (a previous cause/platform for errors mentioned).\n\n2. **mutual_info_score**: This is the primary function throwing the ValueError. It computes mutual information between clustering labels. Issues surface in how labels are initially processed and validated within this function.\n\n3. **check_array**: Part of sklearn's validation utility, with primary responsibility for ensuring input arrays fit specific criteria (dtype transformation, dimensionality requirements, conservative null handling, logistics spotting). The handling of object-typed arrays might critically warrant adjustments if used downstream, circumventing aberrant figures/extremes without progressive casting-specific directed logic (as strawtracked).\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **_supervised.py, line 38**: Adds \"dtype=None\" to the check_array call.

Understand the issue:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue pertains to a regression in `mutual_info_score` from `sklearn.metrics.cluster`. The function fails with a `ValueError` when object dtype (e.g., strings) is used, specifically trying to convert strings to floats. This used to work without warnings in version 0.21.1 but is now resulting in errors.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans:\n\nList of span_ids:\n- contingency_matrix\n- mutual_info_score\n- check_array\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `contingency_matrix`: This function computes a contingency matrix which is a necessary subroutine for various clustering metrics, including `mutual_info_score`. The failure could be rooted in misinterpreted labels during contingency matrix computation.\n\n2. `mutual_info_score`: This is the target function where the error is originating. It calculates mutual information between two clusterings.

It includes input validation for labels and converting them to appropriate formats.\n- **`mutual_info_score`:** The primary function in question, calculates the mutual information score between two clusterings. It processes input labels and generates a contingency matrix.\n- **`check_array`:** Validates input arrays and ensures that they are of the appropriate dtype. This function attempts conversion to float for object dtype arrays, which is partly the source of the regression.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n- Modified hunks:\n  1. `_supervised.py` at line 38\n  2. `_supervised.py` at line 124\n  3. `_supervised.py` at line 584\n  4. `_supervised.py` at line 612\n  5. `validation.py` at line 454\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified hunk in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` at line 38:**\n   Adds `dtype=None` to function calls of `check_array`, ensuring dtype preservation during input validation.\n   \n2. **Modified hunk in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` at line 124:**\n   Adds `.astype(np.float64)` conversion for the contingency matrix when `eps` is not `None` to handle floats rather than integers.\n\n3. **Modified hunk in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` at line 584:**\n   Aligns the docstring formatting and maintains consistency.\n\n4. **Modified hunk in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` at line 612:**\n   Adds logic to convert string labels into integer labels using `np.unique` in both `labels_true` and `labels_pred`. This step ensures strings are processed properly without type conversion issues.\n   \n5. **Modified hunk in `sklearn/utils/validation.py` at line 454:**\n   Adjusts logic in `check_array` to preserve strings in object dtype arrays and avoid converting them to float.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check Correct Location**\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, all changes in the patch apply to functions pertinent to the issue: `mutual_info_score` and `contingency_matrix` in `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` and `check_array` in `sklearn/utils/validation.py`. The patch addresses the input validation issues directly in these functions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe consolidated patch does not seem to introduce new issues and aligns with the changes required by identified code spans. The modification in `check_array` logically interacts with other parts, addressing previously unchecked edge cases of string inputs.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check Patch Fixes the Issue**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fundamentally addresses the issue by checking and preserving strings in object dtype arrays and explicitly converting string labels to integers for clustering calculations. No repetitive code is introduced, and API usages are correct. Proper edge case considerations are made for string handling.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
