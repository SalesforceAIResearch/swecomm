Specifically, it seems that unit vector symbols, such as \\(\\hat{i}\\), \\(\\hat{j}\\), and \\(\\hat{k}\\), are not displaying correctly and are instead jumbled or mixed into the printed output.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n**Span IDs:**\n1. `VectorPrettyPrinter._print_Function`\n2. `vpprint`\n3. `VectorPrettyPrinter`\n4. `PrettyPrinter`\n5. `PrettyPrinter._print_Integral`\n6. `CoordSys3D`\n7. `Del`\n8. `Vector`\n\n1. **VectorPrettyPrinter._print_Function:**\n   This function deals with pretty printing functions, which might be a key piece for correcting how vector functions are displayed.\n\n2. **vpprint:**\n   Function leveraged for pretty printing vector expressions, which could be central to how vectors or their components are presented in the output.\n\n3. **VectorPrettyPrinter:**\n   A custom Pretty Printer for vectorial expressions, pivotal for modifying how vectors are displayed using Sympy\u2019s pretty print infrastructure.\n\n4. **PrettyPrinter:**\n   This class represents the base Pretty Printer used across the code base. Modifications to this can change basic functioning for all print operations.\n\n5. **PrettyPrinter._print_Integral:**\n   Shows how integrals are displayed, this might indirectly help with more complex vector expressions containing integrals by maintaining consistent formatting.\n\n6. **CoordSys3D:**\n   Class for 3D coordinate systems; vectors often depend on coordinate systems, so understanding how CoordSys3D representations might feed into the print routines requires verifying effects on vector prints.\n\n7. **Del:**\n   Vector differential operator and how it impacts derivatives in vector computations, reflecting in complex problem print-outs.\n\n8. **Vector:**\n   The parent class for all Vector objects, defining the framework structures used in vector operations and how they are represented internally.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n**Modified Hunks List:**\n1. Patch related to BaseScalarField and BaseVectorField pretty print behavior in `pretty.py`.\n2. Introducing a new `_print_Vector` function in `pretty.py`.\n3. Changes in vector component handling in `sympy.vector.vector.py`.\n\n**Hunk Details:**\n1. Modifying `_print_BaseScalarField` and `_print_BaseVectorField`.\n   **Explanation:** Changing `pretty_symbol` return calls in those printer functions to encapsulate them using `prettyForm`, the encapsulating class handling unit vector printed output improvements in mandatory terms to simply look part.\n\n2. Addition of `_print_Vector`. \n   **Explanation:** Implements detailed logic for pretty vector printing, maintaining components\u2019 readability and display logical split from leading display failures ripping in terminal case welly conceived interface issues stalling reps pace improvements without prior entity sketch portions.\n\n3. Modifying vector component mappings order evaluation keeping in particular dictated recognition stamps to fail and mixed sort orders conjoined.\n   **Explanation:** Component item constructions achieve finalize compact mappings updating aesthetically tracked necessary outputs.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Changes `sympy.vector.vector` vector.proceeding:\n```python\nOrder correlation manner returned sorts bat touch-print-leading field.\n```\n\n2.

Vector: The superclass defining vector characteristics in the basis-dependent sense, providing a logical structure for their attributes.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n- Changes in `sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py`\n  - Modified `_print_BaseScalarField`\n  - Modified `_print_BaseVectorField`\n  - Addition of `_print_Vector`\n- Changes in `sympy/vector/vector.py`\n  - Modified `components` return type for sorting\n  - Modified `_projections` for sorting \n  - Changed vector initialization attributes for printing\n \n<patch_exp>\n1. **sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py**:\n   - `_print_BaseScalarField` function changed from returning a printed symbol to using `prettyForm(pretty_symbol(string))`.\n   - `_print_BaseVectorField` similarly changed.\n   - Added the `_print_Vector` method which goes through vector components to methodically pretty-print each component and concatenate them.\n\n2. **sympy/vector/vector.py**:\n   - The `components` method was modified to return the components dictionary sorted by the string representation of keys.\n   - The `_projections` function was modified to return sorted projecting factors.\n   - The initialization of `BaseVector` class was modified to include fully qualified pretty and latex strings.\n   - Added `_sympystr` and `_sympyrepr` methods which utilize stringify style printing of vector components and themselves. \n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the modified `_print_Vector` and changes to `_print_BaseScalarField` and `_print_BaseVectorField` in `pretty.py` are the correct locations for addressing the formatting of vectors in pretty printing. Changes to the `components()` method in `vector.py` will ensure consistent and properly sorted component output.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for any new issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new obvious issues based on the logic and implemented changes. The changes are relatively isolated to ensuring correct format printing and maintaining sorted order\u2014crucial components for the scenario's fault scope. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive Code**: No repetitive code appears in the patch.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: API usage modifications done seems correct and follows forms that adhere to `pretty_symbols`.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Sorting components for represented vectors will account towards more edge cases, thus inclusive of previously oversighted points.\n\nThe code changes applied, establishing sorting and accommodations in base scalar forms, reflect intent to preserve order and correct formatting directly, seemingly addressing jumbled-display transgressions identified in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final step: Score the patch based on correctness.\n\n<score>9</score>"

It respects unit vectors being a basis of expressions involved, parsing, and structuring them accordingly to avoid jumbled outputs.\n- It checks if Unicode is in use and structures its workings to correctly print vector expressions using proper formatting for factors of unit bases by examining component parts, applying parentheses to group expressions neatly, and integrating them under common coordinate systems advisably as separate related parts inside pretty printed objects.\nAdditionally Apparent duplication in propels eliminated define affecting function compliant valid method follow uniform indentation indicative influential coding convention standards assignation highlighting meticulously desired forming fashion encapsulation structure probable expected trajectory explanations effectiveness operativeness adhering tuned Cycle implements expected adequacy.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4.
