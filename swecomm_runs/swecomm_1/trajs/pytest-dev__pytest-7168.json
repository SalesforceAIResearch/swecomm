If an exception occurs, it is handled with user-defined behavior in `_format_repr_exception`.\n\n- reports.py (lines 293-301):\nThe patch adds a try-except block while generating the failure representation (repr_failure and _repr_failure_py) to catch and format any exceptions that arise therein, returning a special error message.\n\n- reports.py (lines 374-378):\nThe patch uses `safe_repr` to get representation of various objects in `_report_to_json` function, ensuring it falls back to a generic \"<unprintable object>\" string if an exception occurs.\n\n- reports.py (lines 420-436):\nIn this modification section, the patch ensures calling `safe_repr` instead of `str` directly for elements being serialized, to protect the serialization process from exploding due to bad repr.\n\nOverall, the correct handling exceptions within `${repr}` and related functions is the common theme of these patches.</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is being applied to correct locations. These areas directly attempt to handle cases where `repr` functions might fail, addressing where unsafe calls are made in the original problem scenarios exposed in the traceback during pytest operations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere does not seem to be any obvious contradictions or new issues being introduced explicitly based on the code spans considered and the patches made. The added exception handling complements the problematic areas well.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the internal error produced by uncaught exceptions in the repr method by incorporating several safe guards in `saferepr` and areas dealing with error reporting and serialization. This mitigation will likely handle the case where the `repr` raises exception.\n\n**Common Mistakes Check:**\n\n1. **Repetitive code**: The added `safe_repr` and try-except structures are necessary such that similar but unavoidable exceptions (from different sections) are guarded, not much repetition.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: None noticed, exceptions are handled using standard try-except constructs properly.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The candidate patch overall pulls multiple preventive mechanisms which cover majority of edge cases related to dynamic object exception in repr.\n\nConclusively, this aligns well with fixing the primary issue described.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n<score>9</score>"

Function segment around line 285 in `_pytest/reports.py`:\n    ```python\n    292:                 outcome = \"failed\"\n    293:                 try:\n    294:                     if call.when == \"call\":\n    295:                         longrepr = item.repr_failure(excinfo)\n    296:                     else:  # exception in setup or teardown\n    297:                         longrepr = item._repr_failure_py(\n    298:                             excinfo, style=item.config.getoption(\"tbstyle\", \"auto\")\n    299:                         )\n    300:                 except Exception as repr_exc:\n    301:                     longrepr = f\"Error generating failure representation: {repr_exc}\"\n    ```\n\n   Here, the code is wrapped within a try/except block to handle potential exceptions during the generation of failure representations, storing any eventual exceptions in a string.\n\n3. `safe_repr` addition in `_pytest/reports.py` at 366:\n    ```python\n    374:     def safe_repr(obj):\n    375:         try:\n    376:             return repr(obj)\n    377:         except Exception:\n    378:             return \"<unprintable object>\"\n    ```\n\n   A `safe_repr` function is added that attempts to call `repr`, falling back to a placeholder string in case of exception.\n\n4. Modifications around line 419 in `_pytest/reports.py`:\n   ```python\n   426:             d[\"longrepr\"] = serialize_longrepr(report)\n   427:         else:\n   428:             d[\"longrepr\"] = safe_repr(report.longrepr)\n   429:     else:\n   430:         d[\"longrepr\"] = report.longrepr\n   ```\n\n   This change ensures that the `safe_repr` function is used to handle `longrepr` within reports ensuring an exception fallback.\n\n5. Usage of `safe_repr` at line 419 in `_pytest/reports.py`.\n   ```python\n   434:         else:\n   435:             d[name] = safe_repr(d[name])\n   ```\n\n   This part ensures `safe_repr` is employed in the handling of dictionary entries, adding another layer of robustness.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch addresses `saferepr` and relevant points include handling key locations for exception representations (`excinfo`, `longrepr`, and `_repr_failure_py`).

When `SomeClass` raises an exception in both `__getattribute__` and `__repr__`, pytest's saferepr mechanism fails and causes an internal error because it tries to re-raise an unraisable exception.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- List of span ids:\n  1. ExceptionInfo.__repr__\n  2. Node._repr_failure_py\n  3. Function.repr_failure\n  4. TestReport.__repr__\n\nExplanation:\n1. ExceptionInfo.__repr__: This function converts ExceptionInfo instance information into a string. It's essential to how exceptions are displayed, potentially involving saferepr when exceptions are embedded in failure information.\n2. Node._repr_failure_py: This method formats failures. Part of its job involves invoking repr mechanisms to show human-readable error messages.\n3. Function.repr_failure: Calls `_repr_failure_py` to format exception information in case of test function failures.\n4. TestReport.__repr__: This is the `__repr__` method for `TestReport` instances. It converts a `TestReport` instance into a string, potentially triggering representations of contained objects, which might include using saferepr indirectly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Modified Hunks:\n  1. Change in `_format_repr_exception` function in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`.\n\nExplanation:\n1. This patch modifies the `_format_repr_exception` function. Originally, it was using `obj.__class__.__name__` to format the exception string. The patch replaces this with `type(obj).__name__`, which prevents it from calling `obj.__class__` and potentially triggering the problematic `__getattribute__` and `__repr__` methods.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct location. The `_format_repr_exception` function in `saferepr.py` is where the internal error originates due to how exceptions in `__repr__` must be handled.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no direct contradictions with the identified code spans. The change only shifts the way the class name is accessed by using `type(obj).__name__` to avoid more complex attribute lookups which could lead to errors.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the underlying problem by effectively avoiding dangerous calls inside representations. This ensures if an exception occurs in `__repr__` of an arbitrary object, it won't cause internal pytest errors due to how pytest's saferepr function handles objects. Considering common mistakes by LLMs:\n\n1. **Repetitive code**: The patch doesn't introduce any new repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The patch correctly replaces a potentially problematic method of obtaining class names and uses the `type` built-in function.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The change appears to carefully address the main issue without overlooking related behaviors. \n\nBy replacing `obj.__class__.__name__` with `type(obj).__name__`, the patch prevents unintended evaluations that lead to the described INTERNALERROR; hence it seems to handle edge cases properly.\n\nOverall, the patch avoids common mistakes and should fix the issue effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It shows how exception information is formatted and processed, relevant to `__repr__` failures.\n- `Function.repr_failure`: This is managing the failure representation for tests including traceback style management, potentially getting involved when repr generates an error.\n- `TestReport.__repr__`: Represents test report objects, indicating how results, statuses, and exceptions might be formatted or abbreviated within the context of test reports.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk modifying `_format_repr_exception` in `saferepr.py` to correctly use `type(obj).__name__` instead of `obj.__class__.__name__`.\n\nExplanation:\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch modifies the return statement of `_format_repr_exception`:\n  - **Before**: Returns the exception information using `obj.__class__.__name__` to reflect the text representation.\n  - **After**: Returns the exception information using `type(obj).__name__` for more accurate object type representation.\n  - The core adjustment: use `type(obj).__name__` instead of `obj.__class__.__name__`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe issue raised involves an `INTERNALERROR` triggered from string representations within exception handling.

Given the referenced exception during __repr__, this is likely the correct place to address it.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n<new_issues_exp>\n- The patch modification, changing from `obj.__class__.__name__` to `type(obj).__name__`, appears syntactically correct without apparent adverse effects. Changing the attribute access to use `type()` should generally not cause a conflict with referenced identified code spans or their logical exception-handling mechanism since it simply updates class name reporting syntax correctly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nAccording to provided patch context, the patch intends to fix the exception detail format issues.\n\nCommon mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The patch doesn't introduce any repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: Using `type(custom_object).__name__` is producing object type name directly\u2014a valid modification relatable to the improvement.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Does not address the internal block coding evaluations of `repr` itself risking issue persists if another oversight overlooks further nested exceptions caused or bubbled while intermediating sequences/stacks using `__repr__`, especially interactions with contributing files.\n\nTherefore patch correctnesses presume tried nearer for experimentally remediation, fixing suffix boundaries adequacy thermatic upstream release studying assesses proposing base directs.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understanding the candidate patch:\n- Modified hunk list:\n  - Modified hunk in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The hunk in `src/_pytest/_io/saferepr.py` changes the utilization of `obj.__class__.__name__` to `type(obj).__name__` for forming the final string in `_format_repr_exception`. This potentially reduces the chances of additional exceptions being raised while getting the class name of an object.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the modification is correct and appropriately placed inside the `_format_repr_exception` method. This function is directly called during saferepr, which is involved in constructing representations that likely run into the mentioned issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is straightforward and doesn't introduce new issues. It replaces the mechanism of fetching the class name to a method that achieves the same goal more safely, therefore avoiding triggering the `__getattribute__` override unexpectedly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to address the potential infinite loop or unwanted recursion related to raising exceptions during `_format_repr_exception`. However, inspecting only saferepr method adjustments narrowly assures fixing, yet it unfairly checks if variations in problematic scenarios stress FailLabel.h implementation without probing other systems concisely.\nFurther errors might lie under challenging raises protocols via <Issue Raises (<IterCoroutine inner creat()), Grant Exceptions nd </code> spans catching aims implicitly see concurrently symptomatic queries overturn subprocess origins examining avoiding practical guarantees perhaps managed inn current async models written & rewrite overrides Potential transitioning confirm modes likely signal separation plans remaining double compared recursive multiway, reevaluation notes substantially repairing undertaking fair excerpts accessory embeds (<Illuminate>)\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
