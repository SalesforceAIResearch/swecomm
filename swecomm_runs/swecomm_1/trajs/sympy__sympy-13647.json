This function is directly responsible for recalculating the matrix entries when new columns are inserted. The issue reported directly relates to how the columns are recalculated and shifted, which is managed by `_eval_col_insert`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking if the Patch is Introducing New Issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to be introduced.

However, `self[i, j - pos - other.cols]` is incorrectly changed to `self[i, j - other.cols]`. It should actually reflect `self[i, j - other.cols - pos]` due to the required logical sequence and consideration of the updated positional indices.

When attempting to insert columns into a matrix, the resulting matrix does not maintain the intended structure. Specifically, the inserted columns cause the pre-existing columns' positioning to be corrupted, producing an incorrect arrangement. \n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the `Matrix.col_insert()` function in the `sympy` library does not handle the insertion of columns correctly.
