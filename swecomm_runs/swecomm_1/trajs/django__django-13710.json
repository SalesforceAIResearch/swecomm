It safely defaults back to `self.model._meta.verbose_name_plural` if `verbose_name` is not specified, which should cover usual edge cases.\n\nHowever, the pluralization logic is simplistic since some words form plurals irregularly. Ideally, it should handle more sophisticated pluralization, possibly using a library like `inflect`. Given this can be a potential improvement, it doesn't introduce a mistake per se but points out an area for enhancement.\n\nDespite this, the patch reliably mitigates the original issue and greatly reduces confusion derives from having to define `verbose_name_plural` explicitly if `verbose_name` was given.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
