Previously, the code used `exec(options['command'])`, but it has been changed to `exec(options['command'], globals())`, adding the current global namespace.\n\n2.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n```new_issues_exp```\nThe patch introduces the `globals()` argument within the `exec` calls, but it should ideally use an empty dictionary `{}` or a customized one to define its own scope. Using `globals()` without filtering might lead to unintended consequences, such as security vulnerabilities or unwanted global namespace pollution. However, from the given code snippets and issue description, this context still sustains the overall fix without an explicit contradiction with given code spans.\n```new_issues_exp```\n\n6. Evaluate if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n```fix_issue_exp```\nThe patch indeed accounts for the main issue (execution context for `exec`), applying `globals()` to overcome the `NameError`. However, using `globals()` can be seen as insufficiently selective and might incorporate extraneous global elements, overlooking the edge case that ideally needs a clean, somewhat restrictive execution environment. The presented solution resolves the immediate problem but should prefer a more scoped/global dictionary, as noted originally.\n```fix_issue_exp```\n\n7. Score assignment:\n\n<score>7</score>"

By setting globals while running imported data, it resolves the schema shared already.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe implemented patch renders fitment for solving the instructed bug and complies by appending vital suite-union `globals()`\u2014ultimately ensuring Python method declarations function correctly inside `exec`, which mechanically should eliminate noted `NameError`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring\n\nReviewing entirely and finalizing;\n\n<score>10</score>\n"

The modified global dictionary ensures that necessary built-in and main module context is available during the `exec` calls. The provided globals dictionary is minimal but likely sufficient for many use cases. There is no direct contradiction with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue by ensuring the proper global context is supplied to the `exec` function. This implementation looks satisfactory, as it includes essential globals: `__builtins__` and `__name__`. However, there might be an edge case consideration for other globals that user scripts may require, but this shouldn't be part of the mentioned issue. Other common LLM mistakes, such as repetitive code or incorrect API usage, don't appear in this specific patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
