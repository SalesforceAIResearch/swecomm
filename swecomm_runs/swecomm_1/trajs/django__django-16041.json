                    "msg": "### Steps and Explanations\n\n#### 1. Understand the issue.\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves the handling of the `empty_permitted` attribute in formsets. When setting `form_kwargs` with `empty_permitted=True` or `empty_permitted=False`, a KeyError occurs during the rendering of a template that uses a formset's `empty_form`. This attribute is irrelevant to `empty_form` because `empty_form` is not intended to validate data; hence, `empty_permitted` should be ignored for it.\n</issue_exp>\n\n#### 2. Understand the identified code spans.\nThe identified code spans are:\n1. Span ID: `BaseFormSet.empty_form`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Span `BaseFormSet.empty_form` (lines 258-269): This property defines and returns the `empty_form` for a formset, setting up its key attributes, and also constructs the form using the `get_form_kwargs` method to retrieve additional keyword arguments.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### 3. Understand the candidate patch.\nThe list of modified hunks are:\n1. Hunks from `b/django/forms/formsets.py` starting at line 209\n2. Hunks from `b/django/forms/formsets.py` starting at line 234\n3. Hunks from `b/django/forms/formsets.py` starting at line 262\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk at line 209:** This introduces a modification in the `get_form_kwargs` method by popping `'empty_permitted'` from `form_kwargs` when `index` is `None` (which corresponds to `empty_form`). The new logic ensures that this key does not cause a KeyError when rendering an `empty_form`.\n\n2. **Hunk at line 234:** In the `_construct_form` method, additional logic is added to handle the case where `i` is `None`. Here, it specifically checks for the 'empty_form' case and pops `'empty_permitted'` from `kwargs` if it exists during construction. It ensures extra forms can be empty only when they are not part of the minimum required count. If `i` is not `None`, several conditions and defaults, including `empty_permitted`, are set appropriately.\n\n3. **Hunk at line 262:** In the `empty_form` property method, the patch modifies the extraction of `form_kwargs` by explicitly removing `'empty_permitted'` and then setting it back to `True` before form instantiation. This keeps the form invalid but avoids any external `form_kwargs` interfering.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is mainly targeted at the `empty_form` functionality of formsets in the provided code (identified in the `empty_form` span). The modifications also ensure consistency in removing the `empty_permitted` parameter where it should be ignored.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to be introducing new issues. It corrects the handling of `empty_permitted` specifically for `empty_form` and updates the kwargs as necessary. It doesn't contradict any nearby logic since `empty_form` is processed uniquely.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adheres to addressing common errors by removing the undesired `empty_permitted` key for the `empty_form` and assures the attribute is only added back where necessary and relevant. It considers the edge cases by handling the various instantiation paths properly, especially separating edge handling of `None` indices.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understand the Issue\n\nThe issue is described as follows: There is a problem when trying to render an empty form within a formset in Django. If the property `empty_permitted` is explicitly set in `form_kwargs` (either explicitly to `True` or `False`), it leads to a `KeyError`. This is because the `empty_permitted` property is not relevant for the `empty_form` creation in formsets; it shouldn't be managed there. Expected behavior is to ignore the `empty_permitted` keyword for the `empty_form`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue revolves around a KeyError occurring when attempting to render an empty form in a formset if `empty_permitted` is set explicitly in `form_kwargs`.

Understanding the identified code spans:\nList of span ids:\n- `BaseFormSet.empty_form`\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span identified is:\n\n- `BaseFormSet.empty_form`: This property method returns an empty form that is used in formsets for dynamic form rendering. The issue arises when `empty_permitted` is included in the `form_kwargs` passed to this method, leading to the KeyError as `empty_form` doesn't utilize this argument for any validation purpose.\n\nOther relevant code spans indirectly point to functions contributing to the issue, specifically:\n- `get_form_kwargs`: This function correctly receives `**self.form_kwargs`, making it necessary to omit `empty_permitted` specifically when `index` is `None`.\n- `_construct_form`: Modifies and applies arguments, specifically addressing `empty_form`'s exceptions and self form constructs.\n\nContext here helps demonstrate where `empty_permitted` inclusion causes issues specified.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

This ensures that `empty_form` doesn't fail due to the `empty_permitted` value from `form_kwargs`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the functions `get_form_kwargs`, `_construct_form`, and the `empty_form` property, all of which are directly involved in handling form and parameter instantiation. This precisely targets the `empty_form` construction logic and the appropriate location to address suspect `form_kwargs`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appropriately addresses removing `empty_permitted` in needed logical areas and thus doesn\u2019t contradict any identified code span. There is a slight redundancy in Hunk 3 since `empty_permitted` removal is already handled in Hunk 1, which could lead to slight code repetition, but it doesn\u2019t inherently introduce a major new issue as the removals are idempotent.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch efficiently fixes the original `KeyError` issue by adequately removing `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` whenever `index` (or `i`) is `None`. This neatly falls within problem remediation scope without mistakenly over-impacting different flow cases. However, the reduplicate logic might reflect slight repetitive code usage brackets, a common wearisome outcome within LLM-generated fixes; yet this oversight currently symphonize survivable.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The `empty_permitted` attribute is irrelevant to `empty_form` because `empty_form` isn't supposed to accept or transmit data and hence isn't validated.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that rendering `empty_form` throws a `KeyError` if `empty_permitted` is present in the attributes passed in via `form_kwargs`. Since `empty_form` doesn't need to validate data, the presence of the `empty_permitted` attribute should be ignored in this specific context.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span_ids:\n- BaseFormSet.empty_form\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **BaseFormSet.empty_form**: This code span is in the `empty_form` property of the `BaseFormSet` class. It initializes the `empty_form` with several parameters, including `empty_permitted`, which is fixed at `True`.

Hunk in `django/forms/formsets.py` that modifies the `empty_form` property.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The hunk modifies the `empty_form` property in `django/forms/formsets.py`.

The issue is specifically about the `empty_form` property of `BaseFormSet`, and this patch is making adjustments to that property.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any contradictory behavior related to the identified code span.

This approach ensures that adding unwanted or abnormal input in `form_kwargs` does not persist as it overwrites specific keys with pre-defined values, thus directly addressing the issue of misspecified `form_kwargs`. However, key error from invalid items inside `self.get_form_kwargs(None)` isn't entirely handled. The proposed solution should ensure that errors such as extra unnecessary options are fully preempted.\n\nNo repetitive code or incorrect API usage is present in the patch, but unit-testing is necessary to verify if edge scenarios bypass validation as intended.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score Evaluation\n\n<score>9</score>"

Instead of directly passing all parameters when creating the form, it first updates `form_kwargs` with essential default parameters where `empty_permitted=True` is explicitly set. This way, any `empty_permitted` key in `self.get_form_kwargs(None)` can be overwritten, and the right value is assured before constructing `form`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch updates the construction of `empty_form` to explicitly set the needed parameters before calling the form constructor.

According to the outlined behavior, the `empty_form` should ignore the `empty_permitted` argument since it does not need to be validated.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe problem arises when the `form_kwargs` dictionary includes the `empty_permitted` key, causing a `KeyError` during template rendering. The `empty_permitted` property should be irrelevant and thereby ignored for the `empty_form` to avoid issues.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nList of span IDs:\n- BaseFormSet.empty_form\n\nExplanation of their relevance:\n\nHe identified code span is the `empty_form` property of the `BaseFormSet` class. It\u2019s relevant since this is where the form generation logic occurs, and we need to ensure `empty_permitted` is handled correctly without causing errors.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe `empty_form` property in `BaseFormSet` is where a new form is created with a set of parameters including `empty_permitted`. When rendering this `empty_form`, it must ignore the `empty_permitted` argument as it is not needed, which is the root cause of the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Code within the `empty_form` property is modified to extract `form_kwargs` and update it to ensure all necessary attributes (including `empty_permitted`) are correctly set before creating a form instance.\n\nExplanation for each modified hunk:\n1. The hunk changes the handling of the `empty_permitted` property. Rather than directly passing it when creating the inline form, it adjusts `form_kwargs` by updating it with `empty_permitted` set to `True` along with other necessary parameters before passing `**form_kwargs` to create the form.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch changes the manner in which `empty_form` is created. It first obtains `form_kwargs` and then consolidates the initializing parameters (`auto_id`, `prefix`, `use_required_attribute`, `empty_permitted`, `renderer`) into `form_kwargs` using `.update()`. Then, it uses this updated `form_kwargs` to instantiate the form instead of repeating parameters in the constructor directly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\nThis is indeed the right location to address the issue since the root of the issue is within the `empty_form` property of the `BaseFormSet` class.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, this fixes the appropriate function \u2013 the `empty_form` property in `BaseFormSet`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\nThe changes are streamlined and restructured in a way that ensures each of the necessary form initialization parameters including `empty_permitted` is included without resulting in a KeyError. The changes don\u2019t appear to conflict with identified code spans or introduce new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no apparent new issues introduced by this patch since it properly consolidates the parameters required for form creation and handles `empty_permitted` correctly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n- **Repetitive Code**: The patch improves redundancy by consolidating form parameters.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: It correctly uses the `update()` method to modify the `form_kwargs` dictionary.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: It explicitly handles the `empty_permitted` parameter making the rendering via `empty_form` clean and without errors.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately addresses the issue by restructuring how parameters are assigned to `form_kwargs`, ensuring `empty_permitted` is set and not causing a `KeyError`. There's no repetitive code but an improvement to parameter handling and no evident overlooked edges directly related to the focused aspect.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
