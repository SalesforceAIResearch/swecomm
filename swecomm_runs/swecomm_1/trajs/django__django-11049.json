Implementing the constructor `__init__` to add default help text is an appropriate handling without causing redundancy. Reviewing for commonly made LLM mistakes:\n1. Repetitive code: No redundant or repetitive logic was noted.\n2. Incorrect API usage: Proper subclass mechanisms were utilized without misapplication.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Thorough comprehension inferred for millions-to-seconds inclusive ([DD]).\nPatch well-crafted with correct integral areas covered though a broader code Basis implementing it confirmed validations sanitizes adequacy entirely.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Therefore, the patch is fixing the correct function.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It makes a simple string replacement in the `default_error_messages` to correct the format description. There are no contradictions with the identified code span or other parts of the provided code snippet.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Check\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly updates the error message to reflect the actual behavior of formatting `DurationField` values. It addresses the issue directly by modifying the format string from `\"[DD] [HH:[MM:]]ss[.uuuuuu] format.\"` to `\"[DD] [[HH:]MM:]ss[.uuuuuu] format.\"`. This ensures that the error message accurately guides the user on the expected duration format. The patch does not contain repetitive code or incorrect API usage, and it fully accounts for the issue described.\n\nHowever, it does not address the secondary suggestion in the issue description, which asks for the inclusion of help text explaining the format. This does not warrant a deduction, but it should be noted.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
