                    "msg": "Let's go through each required step in detail to evaluate the LLM-generated patch towards resolving the outlined issue.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\n1. **Explain the Issue**:\n   - **Original Issue Text**:\n      - The `AlterOrderWithRespectTo()` operation after adding an index for the `_order` field raises an error because the `_order` field does not exist at the time `AlterOrderWithRespectTo()` is invoked.\n      - Therefore, `AlterOrderWithRespectTo()` needs to run before adding the index on the `_order` field.\n\n   - **Explanation**:\n      ```issue_exp\n      The issue stems from performing the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation after an index including `_order` field is attempted to be created. The absence of the `_order` field when `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` runs results in an error. Hence, the sequence of operations needs rectifying so that `_order` is present before the index is created.\n      ```\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n2. **List of Span IDs**:\n   - Span IDs: `MigrationAutodetector.generate_added_indexes`, `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to`, `AddIndex.__init__`, `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`, `AlterOrderWithRespectTo.__init__`, `AddIndex.database_forwards`, `AddIndex`, \n\n3. Explanation of Code Spans:\n   ```code_span_exp\n   1. `MigrationAutodetector.generate_added_indexes`: Handles the auto-detection of added indexes during a migration.\n   2. `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to`: Handles the ordering of operations, specifically the `order_with_respect_to` meta option.\n   3. `AddIndex.__init__`: Initializes an addition of an index during a model operation.\n   4. `AddIndex.database_forwards`: Defines forward database migration steps to add indexes.\n   5. `AddIndex`: Defines an operation of adding an index to a model.\n   6. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo`: Represents a change related to the `order_with_respect_to` meta option.\n   7. `AlterOrderWithRespectTo.__init__`: Initializes `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation.\n   ```\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n4. **List of Modified Hunks**:\n   - Hunk 1: Changes in `__init__` Method (lines 44-66)\n   - Hunk 2: Changes around handling `AddIndex` and `_order` fields (around line `240`)\n   - Hunk 3: Changes in `state_forwards` for `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` (lines 602-612)\n   - Hunk 4: Changes regarding adding index operations with `_order` field check (lines 763-782)\n   - Hunk 5: Changes in getting dependencies to include checks for `_order` in index fields (lines 802-814)\n\n5. **Explanation of Modified Hunks**:\n   ```patch_exp\n   1. **Hunk 1**:\n      - Ensures `_order` field exists if `order_with_respect_to` is specified by adding `_order` field if necessary during model initialization.\n   \n   2. **Hunk 2**:\n      - Adjusts logic so that if adding an index and the index includes `_order`, it ensures `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` is handled first.\n   \n   3. **Hunk 3**:\n      - Ensures `_order` field is added to the model's fields if it is not present during `state_forwards`.\n      \n   4. **Hunk 4**:\n      - Checks for existence of `_order` field during `database_forwards` operations before adding index. Adds `_order` field if it is missing.\n      \n   5. **Hunk 5**:\n      - Updates dependencies to add `AlterOrderRetentionist` operation if `_order` is part of index fields.\n   ```\n\n### Correctness and Robustness Check\n\n6. **Check if the patch fixes the correct function**:\n   - **Explanation**:\n     ```correct_location_exp\n     Yes, the patch addresses the sequence issue by ensuring that the `_order` field is present before `AddIndex` operation is invoked, and running `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation if `_order` is included. The functionality adjustments seem correctly placed.\n     ```\n\n7. **Checking for New Issues**:\n   - **Explanation**:\n     ```new_issues_exp\n     The change in the `state_forwards` and `database_forwards` methods ensures backward compatibility and check-introduces conditions. It eliminates contradictions by ensuring `_order` field presence before handling `order_with_respect_to` attribute, avoiding errors related to missing '_order' field.\n     ```\n\n8. **Checking if the patch can fix the issue**:\n   - **Explanation**:\n     ```fix_issue_exp\n     The patch appears comprehensive and methodical in its approach. Since it \n\t (1) ensures `_order` field during model initialization, \n\t (2) adjusts dependency handling for `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations on `_order`,\n\t (3) refines indexing checks, and \t\t\t\n\t (4) consistently integrates `_order` field when appropriate.\n     Hence, it resolves the original issue effectively.\n     ```\n\n### Scoring the Patch\n\n9. **Scoring**:\n   - The patch seemingly addresses the issue without conflicting with identified code spans individually or collectively. There have been no new errors or repetitive code inception spotted. \n\n```score\n9\n```"

If `_order` is missing, it adds `_order` with a default value of 0.\n\n2. <after_file=\"b/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\" start_line=240>\n   This part addresses the reduction of `AddIndex` operations. It adds logic to ensure that if '_order' appears in the index fields, it results in first appending the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation and then the `AddIndex` operation.\n\n3. <after_file=\"b/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\" start_line=596>\n   In `state_forwards`, this part of the patch modifies the model's _order fields if `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` doesn't find the '_order' field. It adds '_order' to the model\u2019s state if it's absent.\n\n4. <after_file=\"b/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\" start_line=763>\n   This part updates `AddIndex.database_forwards` to check if the model has an '_order' field in and ensures that this field gets created if it doesn't exist before adding the index.\n\n5. <after_file=\"b/django/db/migrations/operations/models.py\" start_line=802>\n   This segment adds a dependency check to ensure `AddIndex` depends on `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` if '_order' is involved, described the same in `get_dependencies`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the affected methods related to `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` and `AddIndex` operations within migrations, ensuring they perform their actions in the correct sequence and account for the creation of the `_order` field.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are apparent in applying this patch. The changes properly consider ensuring the presence of the `_order` field before applying the add index and delicate balancing these relevant operations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n### Common LLM Mistakes Analysis:\n1. **Repetitive code**: The changes introduced ensure conditional handling of `_order`, without repetitively handling the same logic in different spans.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The use of APIs and methods like `add_field`, `reload_model`, and ensuring defaults align with Django's migration framework usage.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The implementation actively checks the presence of `_order`, accounting for the potential introduction or absence.\n\nA possible negative edge case reflection would consider endless overrides or database inconsistencies caused by improperly reloaded models, but chiefly allowing for re-evaluated field presence steps.\n\nYes, the patch addresses the main issue by ensuring the `order_with_respect_to` operations are handled correctly relative to adding indexes involving the `_order` field.

This is because the `_order` field has not been created by the time the index operation attempts to access it. Therefore, the `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` operation should be performed before the `AddIndex` operation to ensure the necessary field `_order` is available at the time of creating the index.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Code Span Explanation\n\n**List of span ids:**\n1.

The proposed solution is to reorder the migration operations so that `AlterOrderWithRespectTo` comes before `AddIndex`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n- **List of Span IDs:** \n  - MigrationAutodetector.generate_added_indexes\n  - MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_order_with_respect_to\n  - AddIndex.__init__\n  - AlterOrderWithRespectTo\n  - AlterOrderWithRespectTo.__init__\n  - AddIndex.database_forwards\n  - AddIndex\n  - AlterOrderWithRespectTo.database_forwards\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **MigrationAutodetector.generate_added_indexes**: This method generates migration operations for adding new indexes.
