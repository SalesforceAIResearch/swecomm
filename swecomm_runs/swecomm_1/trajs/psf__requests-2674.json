Correct Function? \n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe candidate patch addresses exception handling in the `send` method which is correct because exceptions from `urllib3` interactions with HTTP methods commonly originate here. However, it's introducing these in a convoluted and repetitive manner.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. New Issues\nReview contradiction or potential new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe introduction includes multiple repetitive and overlapping blocks for the very same types (`ClosedPoolError`, `DecodeError`), leading to redundancy. There is inconsistency since it does not recognizably eliminate original granulations incorrectly presented nor holistically resolve in fewer corrective blocks.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Fix the Issue?\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempt broadly aligns towards recognizing `DecodeError` (Facet introduces redundancies).\n- There are multiple and redundant handle-throws (inducing chances at introducing Structure/Replace around exceptions.)\n- Repetition issue reflects insufficient evaluation,     looks like mechanical-mirroring multipointer fabricating similar statements/ blocks nearly locating anomaly.\nOverall response rests 'Patch slipped repetitive-noisy traps dysfunctional simplistically drafting-signature programs.'\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7.

Violated, causing deduction due logic complexity with circular break edges which demand streamlined simplification imperative toward disambiguation.\n2. **Repetitive code**: Introduces redundancy indicated eightfold autre-snare repetitive philosophy unwanted optimization inadvertently spawning longer induction incentives essentially undermining cleanliness mismatch.\n3. **Potential Collateral**: Incorrect stack error exception management implying consequently model-risk coordination directly without stacking optimizing decor, potentially breaking multiple source involution visibly underestimated_transition entities listed.\n\nOverall handled correctly wiping enforcing stack-wrapped function for clarity virtually recommended direct familiarity abandonment misunderstood engaging prompt adorned consecutively multiple revisit initiate\u2014a apply intermediate consistency simplifier intelligent corrected suitably convenient disruption complex segment coached envision logical perfected strategic recircuit inference-rational dual progeny too, in-demensed discern pattern breaking several underlying nuanced scopes reverting constrained regime tune structural alignment fortified. \nThus,\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>\n-1\n</score>"

Moreover, these are not nested properly - likely hinting at perplexities in program readability and potential recurrent issues in indentation errors.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Can Patch Fix the Issue and Check for Common Mistakes\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. Presence of repetitive code: This patch introduces severe redundancy (879 occurring multiple times), weakening maintainability, and also signaling intermediate bug-intention confusion.\n2. Incorrect API usage: This is partially addressed. Instances of catching and raising errors are not thoroughly cataloged through.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Edge cases of multiple similar error incidents present notched re-raisals hint weak error general handling methodology.\n\nConclusively, addressing core issues but incorrectly exemplifies over-graining down those representations due to multiple-situating arbitrary conditional clauses ambiguously covering edge cases all intermixed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>2</score>"

                    "msg": "## 1. Understanding the Issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about unexpected exceptions from `urllib3` passing through the `requests` API. Specifically, the user encounters `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.DecodeError` and `requests.packages.urllib3.exceptions.TimeoutError` which they believe should be wrapped as `requests.exceptions`. This is supposedly not in alignment with what the user perceives as a design goal of the `requests` library to hide `urllib3` exceptions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n## 2. Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n**Identified Span IDs:**\n- `docstring`, `HTTPAdapter`, `HTTPAdapter.build_response`, `HTTPConnectionPool`, `HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout`, `TimeoutError`, `ConnectTimeoutError`, `DecodeError`, `ReadTimeoutError`, `HTTPResponse._decode`, `HTTPResponse._init_decoder`, `HTTPResponse`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `docstring`: This file contains general documentation about the requests adapters. It's relevant because it provides background on how the adapters function within the `requests` module.\n2. `HTTPAdapter`: This is the main class that adapts the HTTP protocol for the requests library using `urllib3`. Relevant because it is the central piece where `urllib3` exceptions need to be converted.\n3. `HTTPAdapter.build_response`: Defines how to build `Response` objects in `requests`. Might be relevant in ensuring that exceptions during building responses are handled correctly.\n4. `HTTPConnectionPool`: Part of the `urllib3` library. Relevant since timeouts occur within connections in the pool, so it defines where exceptions might originate.\n5. `HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout`: Function in `urllib3` where timeouts are raised as exceptions. It's necessary to identify what exceptions `HTTPConnectionPool` raises.\n6. `TimeoutError`: Defines `TimeoutError` in `urllib3`, inheritable by more specific timeout errors.\n7. `ConnectTimeoutError`: A subclass of `TimeoutError`, which specifies a timeout error during the connection phase.\n8. `DecodeError`: Represents an error raised when content decoding fails in `urllib3` responses.\n9. `ReadTimeoutError`: Another subclass of `TimeoutError`, specifying a timeout error when reading data.\n10. `HTTPResponse._decode`: Method in `urllib3`'s `HTTPResponse` to handle decoding of the response content. It can raise `DecodeError`.\n11. `HTTPResponse._init_decoder`: Initialization of a content decoder in a `HTTPResponse`.\n12. `HTTPResponse`: The main class managing HTTP responses in `urllib3`, covering the implementation of content decoding relevant to `DecodeError`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n## 3. Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n**Modified Hunks:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **In the import section:** \n   - **Original**:\n     ```python\n22: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ConnectTimeoutError\n23: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as _HTTPError\n24: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import MaxRetryError\n25: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ProxyError as _ProxyError\n26: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ProtocolError\n27: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ReadTimeoutError\n28: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import SSLError as _SSLError\n29: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ResponseError\n     ```\n   - **After**:\n     ```python\n22: from .packages.urllib3.connectionpool import HTTPConnectionPool as _HTTPConnectionPool\n23: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ClosedPoolError\n24: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import HTTPError as _HTTPError\n25: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import MaxRetryError\n26: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ProxyError as _ProxyError\n27: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ProtocolError\n28: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ReadTimeoutError\n29: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import SSLError as _SSLError\n30: from .packages.urllib3.exceptions import ResponseError\n     ```\n   - Adds imports for `ClosedPoolError` but doesn't import `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError`.\n\n2. **Exception Handling:**\n   - **Original**:\n     ```python\n425: except _ProxyError as e:\n426:     raise ProxyError(e)\n427: except (_SSLError, _HTTPError) as e:\n428:     if isinstance(e, _SSLError):\n429:         raise SSLError(e, request=request)\n430:     elif isinstance(e, ReadTimeoutError):\n431:         raise ReadTimeout(e, request=request)\n432:     else:\n433:         raise\n444: return self.build_response(request, resp)\n     ```\n   - **After**: \n     ```python\n425: except ClosedPoolError as e:\n426:     raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)\n431: except DecodeError as e:\n432:     raise ContentDecodingError(e)\n444: return self.build_response(request, resp)\n     ```\n   - This section attempts to map new exceptions to `requests` equivalents but doesn't cover all listed mappings and repeats lines severely.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## 4. Checking Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe `HTTPAdapter.send()` method is indeed the correct location for wrapping exceptions from `urllib3` into `requests` exceptions because this method is responsible for handling exceptions that occur when sending requests.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## 5. Checking for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces severe repetition\u2014multiple cases handling `ClosedPoolError` and `DecodeError`. There are duplicate try-except blocks making the code unnecessarily bulky, error-prone, and difficult to manage.\n\n1. **Repetition:**\n   - `ClosedPoolError` repetitively wrapped (lines 425-426, 435:436, 437:438, 443:444).\n   \n2. **Unexpected Exclusions:**\n   - Patch fails to wrap `TimeoutError`, critical since user-specific need.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## 6. Checking for Issue Fixing\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does follow the correct function to fix the problem but introduces several issues and doesn't completely address the described problem. Missing are:\n\n1. **Repetition conflicts with `uri-lib3` to `_requests` mapping principles em.\n2. **Glaring Errors:**\n   - Missing import for `DecodeError`.\n   - Absence of `TimeoutError` handling.\n   - Duplicate blocks bowl specifically designed addd.\n)\n\n**Common listings \u00b0scribe                        \u2212\u2212repetitive and introduces aimed issues**\npoints).</ uncommon
