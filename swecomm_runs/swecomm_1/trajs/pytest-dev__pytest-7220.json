This seems appropriately placed, considering that path manipulations and related representations are primarily handled here.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the correct function by adding the new `_relative_path` method, which deals with computing relative paths from the original directory in the terminal output related parts of the code.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n\nThe added `_relative_path` function relies on `self.original_dir` having the `bestrelpath` method. It does not introduce repetitive code and should fit into the larger system without contradictory issues if the assumption holds correctly about `self.original_dir`.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues or contradictory behavior.

If `original_dir` is correctly managed and initialized, it appears to handle the edge cases relevant to the issue effectively.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively integrates the needed adjustment without generating repetitive code, using wrong APIs, or missing critical edge cases. The solution implemented is localized and leverages existing interfaces (`bestrelpath`).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score the Candidate Patch\n\nGiven that the patch appears valid, correct, and appropriate without perceptible shortcomings within the described scope, a high score is warranted.\n\n<score>10</score>"
