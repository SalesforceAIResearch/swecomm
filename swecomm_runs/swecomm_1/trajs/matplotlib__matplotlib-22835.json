This helps because any ValueError arising due to the lack of invertibility gets caught and managed. However, since pulling exact edge-case recoveries with the gentle default message may not be failproof, generally fixed while avoiding common patterns could suffice.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Modified Hunk in lib/matplotlib/artist.py from lines 1273 to 1340:\n   - The patch enhances the `format_cursor_data` method by adding a check for non-invertibility. It incorporates a try-except block to catch `ValueError` when calling the `inverse` method and proceeds to handle it by either using an `approximate_inverse` method if available or indicating that the value is not precisely representable.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. The function `format_cursor_data` is the location where the crash occurs due to calling the `inverse` method of `BoundaryNorm`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are identified. The modifications handle the specific error condition that was causing the crash and do not introduce contradictory behavior with the other identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch resolves the issue by putting a try-except block around the call to the `inverse` method and handling the potential `ValueError`. It also proposes using an `approximate_inverse` if available or indicating when the value can't be precisely represented. It covers edge cases effectively\u2014an exception is properly caught and an alternative handling path is defined. However, one common issue with LLM patches is potential repetitive code due to not having full context but this is not evident here. No repetitive code or incorrect API usages are noted. The patch considers several logical paths clearly and improves robustness, while keeping it streamlined.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Artist.format_cursor_data:\n   This code span contains the implementation of the `format_cursor_data` method, which is responsible for providing string representations of data values for cursor display. The issue is that this function tries to use the `inverse` method of the normalization object which crashes if it's an instance of `BoundaryNorm`.\n\n2. BoundaryNorm.inverse:\n   This code span defines the `inverse` method of the `BoundaryNorm` class, which intentionally raises a ValueError to indicate that BoundaryNorm is not designed to be invertible.\n\n3. BoundaryNorm.__call__:\n   This code span shows how `BoundaryNorm` maps values to integers. It transforms values based on bin boundaries and may also involve clipping.\n\n4. BoundaryNorm:\n   This is the declaration and summary of the BoundaryNorm class which maps values to discrete intervals using specified boundaries.\n\n5. BoundaryNorm.__init__:\n   This code span defines the constructor method that initializes a BoundaryNorm object with boundaries, number of colors, and clipping settings.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk in `lib/matplotlib/artist.py` from lines 1297-1350:\n   - The modified code is adding multiple conditional checks for whether the normalization object is an instance of BoundaryNorm. It also introduces handling for different boundary conditions and extensions associated with Boundary Norm, with added conditions for `clip`, `extend='min'`, and other cases.\n   - Noteworthy, the code introduces repetitive `if isinstance(self.norm, mcolors.BoundaryNorm):` blocks, which ideally should not be repeated multiple times.\n   - It replaces parts of the original logic by including multiple `clip` and `extend` cases with `pass`, ultimately intending to manage the specific BoundaryNorm case.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `format_cursor_data` inside `artist.py`. This function indeed tries to call `.inverse` on the normalization object, leading to the crash when it encounters a `BoundaryNorm`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is introducing new issues with lots of repetitive code. Multiple redundant conditional blocks checking whether `norm` is an instance of `BoundaryNorm` is not efficient and clutters the function. This unnecessarily repeated logic could lead to increased maintenance problems.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempts to fix the issue by ensuring special checks are made for instances of `BoundaryNorm`. However, it significantly falls under category 1 (Repetitive code) of common mistakes made by LLMs. Redundancy could be reduced significantly, providing a clearer, simpler solution. The code also uses improper format e.g., consecutive `pass` statements and does not offer any real processing, failing to handle possible variations effectively.\nFor instance, instead of repeating `if isinstance(self.norm, mcolors.BoundaryNorm):` several times, it could be simplified and handled comprehensively in a single conditional block.\nConsequently, while it targets the right function for the issue, the execution leaves much to be desired and adds verbosity instead of a neat solution. \n\nThe initial problem still leaks through as mouse interactivity is non-functional due to simply setting `g_sig_digits` value without reverting to the right inverse calculations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>2</score>"

However, the way it handles it seems overly repetitive, with copy-pasted logic without actual diverse operations across different conditions. Moreover, edge cases like composite datatype handling appear to be partly neglected, only generically assigning `g_sig_digits` a constant value. No genuine improvement is applied to replicate practical boundaries operation, needed to ensure efficacy.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>3</score>"
