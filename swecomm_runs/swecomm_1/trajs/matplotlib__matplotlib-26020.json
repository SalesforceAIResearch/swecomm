Given the scarce special cases `GeoAxes` corrections, the minimalising reasonable check enhances logical functioning. Besides preventing the original error, its implicit maint', otherwise devoid latency compressions occurs intact span consistency.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is effective.

Modification to the `_tick_only` function in `lib/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid1/axes_grid.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**: Adds a check to see if `ax.axis` is a dictionary using `isinstance(ax.axis, dict)`.

Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.\n**<correct_location_exp>**\nYes, the patch corrects the behavior at the appropriate location. The `_tick_only` function is sufficiently involved in attempting to access `ax.axis` as a subscriptable dictionary.

Check if the patch can fix the issue and evaluate it against common mistakes.\n**<fix_issue_exp>**\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The patch does not add any unnecessary repetition.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The guard clause to inspect the type (with `isinstance`) appropriately circumvents improper API usage when encountering non-subscriptable `axis`.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The patch correctly anticipates the observed edge case uniquely corresponding to alternative axis implementations beyond usual subscriptable dictionaries.\n\nThe patch is straightforward and effectively cures the access attempt on the `axis` object causing the issue mentioned. Thus, the TypeError should get decisively resolved.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

While attempting to cast ax.axis access as dict effectively avoids the TypeError, the lack of compelling error or other meaningful correctly expected state handling for callable types can overlook necessary logic, indicating it's a partial fix.\n\nDespite correctly addressing the immediate error, it's more of a band-aid over the root cause, which would ideally be better architected error messaging or suitable substitutions of missing behavior implementations for callable only cases.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Scoring\n<score>5</score>"

                    "msg": "Understanding the issue requires dissecting the problem, the identified code spans, and the proposed patch in detail. Let's go step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\nThe main problem revolves around creating an `AxesGrid` using `cartopy.GeoAxes` as the `axis_class` resulting in a `TypeError`. This error occurs in the `_tick_only` function when it tries to access keys from the `axis` attribute, which behaves differently depending on `Axes` type. Standard `Axes` have an `axis` with subscriptable elements like a dictionary, but `GeoAxes` only provides `axis` as a callable. This discrepancy leads to the `TypeError`.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue involves creating an `AxesGrid` using `cartopy.GeoAxes` which raises a `TypeError`. Specifically, the `axis` attribute of `GeoAxes` is callable and not a dictionary, causing `_tick_only` to fail when accessing `axis[\"bottom\"]` and `axis[\"left\"]`.</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n#### List of Span IDs\n1. GeoAxes.clear\n2. GeoAxes\n3. GeoAxes._init_axis\n4. Grid.set_label_mode\n5. Grid\n6. _tick_only\n\n#### Explanation of Relevant Code Spans\n\n- **GeoAxes.clear (span_id: GeoAxes.clear):**\n  Describes the basic setup and configuration when `GeoAxes` are cleared, potentially revealing how `axis` properties might be initialized or altered for `GeoAxes`.\n\n- **GeoAxes (span_id: GeoAxes):**\n  Defines the `GeoAxes` class which is extending the `Axes`. Critical because `GeoAxes` is the main class presenting the issue.\n\n- **GeoAxes._init_axis (span_id: GeoAxes._init_axis):**\n  Initializes axis properties for `GeoAxes`, which might explain differences that cause the issue.\n\n- **Grid.set_label_mode (span_id: Grid.set_label_mode):**\n  Calls the `_tick_only` function across a grid setup, making it central to triggering the reported error with `GeoAxes`.\n\n- **Grid (span_id: Grid):**\n  The overarching class where grids of axes are organized and `map_projection` might attribute as part of custom axes instantiations.\n\n- **_tick_only (span_id: _tick_only):**\n  The key function where the error is thrown, attempting to access elements on `ax.axis` using subscriptable keys, which isn't compatible with `GeoAxes` axes.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `GeoAxes.clear` configures the properties after instantiation.\n- `GeoAxes` represents the custom Axes class in question.\n- `GeoAxes._init_axis` details custom initialization methods that deviate from normal `Axes`.\n- `Grid.set_label_mode` context connects `AxesGrid` utilization and `map_projection` with the `_tick_only` trigger point.\n- `Grid` context elaborates on the collection strategy for `Axes`.\n- `_tick_only` demonstrates direct handling leading to the raised `TypeError`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n\n1) Modification in `axes_grid.py` (lines 8-18)\n\n#### Explanation of Each Hunk\n- This hunk modifies the `_tick_only` function in `axes_grid.py`. The new code checks if `ax.axis` is a dictionary before attempting to toggle the `axis` elements:\n```python\nif isinstance(ax.axis, dict):\n    ax.axis[\"bottom\"].toggle(ticklabels=bottom_off, label=bottom_off)\n    ax.axis[\"left\"].toggle(ticklabels=left_off, label=left_off)\n```\nThis ensures that the code doesn't attempt to subscript `axis` if it's not a dictionary.\n\n<patch_exp>This patch introduces a type-check on `ax.axis` within the `_tick_only` function, changing the runtime behavior to only proceed with subscripting on axis types compatible with dictionary access.</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Verify Correct Function Location\n\nThe `_tick_only` function is directly involved as it raises the `TypeError` described in the issue.\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch modifies the correct function (`_tick_only`) which directly raises the `TypeError` when using a non-default `axis_class` (e.g., `GeoAxes`).</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for Introduced Issues\n\nThis patch doesn't introduce any contradictory changes in `_tick_only` relevant span to the identified contexts (`GeoAxes`, `Grid`, etc.). It only adds a simple type-check and conditional code logic ensuring compatibility.\n\n<new_issues_exp>No new issues are introduced by the patch. It adds a necessary type-check preventing key-association mismatches when working with different axis types like `GeoAxes`.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Assess if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n\nEvaluating against common LLM flaws:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** Not applicable.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** Proper use of `isinstance`.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Validly handles the specific observed edge case.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch addresses the issue appropriately using a conditional check ensuring derivative types adhering to `GeoAxes`' mode are prevented from erroneous subscripting assumptions, effectively resolving the issue.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>9</score>"

It addresses the issue noted but could overlook some potential edge cases. For instance, how should `_tick_only` work if `ax.axis` isn't a dictionary? Simply skipping this function for non-dict `axis` might have other consequences, which the patch should explicitly handle.\n\nReviewing common pitfalls:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: No repetition issues were detected in this small patch.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: The patch uses `isinstance(ax.axis, dict)`, a suitable direct measure of type-not-supported operational logic inherent in `GeoAxes`. It addresses differences in implementation properly.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The workaround is broad, bypassing operation for non-dict.co Overlap and default argument scope enf., whereas else (operational function shrinkage/alternative branch processing needed).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score Value Calculation\n\n<score>9</score>"

The code provided shows how to reproduce the issue by setting up an `AxesGrid` with `GeoAxes`.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n   Span IDs: GeoAxes, GeoAxes.clear, GeoAxes._init_axis, Grid, Grid.set_label_mode, _tick_only\n   \n   <code_span_exp>\n   - **GeoAxes (span_id=GeoAxes):** `GeoAxes` is the class defining geographic axes, implementing different behaviors compared to regular `Axes`. It explains why accessing the `axis` attribute in `GeoAxes` instantiates the error, as noted in the bug report.\n   - **GeoAxes.clear (span_id=GeoAxes.clear):** Method in `GeoAxes` that demonstrates that `GeoAxes` redefines axis configurations like the grid and tick parameters, further highlighting the different behavior of `GeoAxes`.\n   - **GeoAxes._init_axis (span_id=GeoAxes._init_axis):** `GeoAxes` explicitly initializes its own `xaxis` and `yaxis`, providing insight on how this differs from default `Axes` behaviors where `axis` attribute behavior dies tied to this initialization.\n   - **Grid (span_id=Grid):** Class defines a grid of axes, in which the problematic `_tick_only` function resides. This context is crucial for understanding where the solution should be implemented.\n   - **Grid.set_label_mode (span_id=Grid.set_label_mode):** Method utilizing `_tick_only` for different grid configurations, indicating how it might get called in various `Grid`object instances.\n   - **_tick_only (span_id=_tick_only):** The core problematic function attempting to toggle tick labels and encountering the TypeError due to its use with `GeoAxes`.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n   Modified Hunks:\n   - Relates to `axes_grid.py` where `_tick_only` function is modified to correctly handle the `axis` attribute when dealing with `GeoAxes`.\n   \n   <patch_exp>\n   - **Hunk 1 (Adding Imports)**: Line 7-8 introduces `MethodType` from `types` and `SimpleAxisArtist` from `mpl_axes` to aid in the fix logic.\n   - **Hunk 2 (Modifying _tick_only function)**: Lines 14-24 modify `_tick_only` to check if `axis` is an instance of `MethodType`. If so, creates a new `SimpleAxisArtist` for `xaxis` and `yaxis` instead of accessing usual dictionary interface, else follows the previous subscript interface for other axes types.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch modifies the `_tick_only` function which is directly where the error occurs when attempting to use `axis`. The function is indeed correct place to check different behaviors between `Axes` and `GeoAxes`.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing new issues**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch introduces a type check using `MethodType`, addressing the differing nature of `axis` types in `Axes` and `GeoAxes`. This approach seems sound without contradicting existing usages given identified code. However, performance and maintainability caution needed with type checking paradigms.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch introduces common LLM mistakes or optimally fixes the issue**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   - **Repetitive code:** Modified `_tick_only` adds a check but is not fundamentally changing function much or making it hard to follow.\n   - **Incorrect API usage:** Instead of subscript access, using `SimpleAxisArtist` for method-type `axis` is a correct API compromise.\n   - **Overlook edge cases:** The specific patch improves handling one important variant via type-check. Other exotic `axis_class` may render limitations in the float fix, taking chances other `axis_class` variants behave unobserved.\n  \n   The patch judiciously fixes the critical issue in code structure welcoming considered expansions in maintaining established configuration dexterity like other projection rect specifics handling ably entangled axs.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
