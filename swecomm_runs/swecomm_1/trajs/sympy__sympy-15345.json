Relevant to the issue as it likely affects how the Max function is printed.\n- mathematica_code: This is the function that initiates the conversion process. It is relevant because the observed behavior that is producing the incorrect code happens here.\n- docstring: Provides context and reference examples for Mathematica code generation which is useful for understanding how `_print_Function` is expected to work but not directly handled by any logic in the discussed patch.\n- MCodePrinter: Defines the class where printing methods for different expressions reside, including `_print_Function`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunks:\n1. `a/sympy/printing/mathematica.py: start_line 89`\n   - Inserts a special case to handle the \"Max\" function within `_print_Function`.\n   - Ensures that the conversion of `Max(x, 2)` happens in the desired format.\n   - Adds a separate method `_print_Max` that uses a similar conversion logic to genericize Max handling.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch addresses `_print_Function`, which is indeed responsible for the problem. Furthermore, it extends support by adding a dedicated `_print_Max` method. These changes target the necessary functions involved in formatting the output correctly for Mathematica's conventions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modification in `_print_Function` for special handling of \"Max\" should ideally work without introducing new issues because:\n- The general pattern (_print_Function) did not address Max by name initially.\n- The dedicated `_print_Max` implementation economically duplicates responsibility, maintaining overall consistency.\nGiven the insertions do not overlap with conditions covered in upstream functions or entail vast repeititve actions.\n\nTherefore, the inclusion appears valid.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch properly addresses converting the Python `Max` function into its Mathematica equivalent `Max[...]` notation.\nConsidering mistakes:\n1. It's slightly repetitive to address `\"Max\"` within two-fold `_print_Function` without centralized MCodePrinter registry augment.\n2. Overhead of `_print_Function`, each conditional being tried before unavailable, remained but not negative for conventional optimizations herein (further cover-each handler const setup needed possibly deferred).\n\nThus, correctly fashioned Max within target transformation intact alleviated the error at its intent.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The specific instruction is that for an input `Max(x, 2)`, it is producing `Max(2, x)` while the expected output format in Mathematica should be `Max[x,2]`.\n\n   ```main({issue_exp)The issue is that the current code for generating Mathematica expressions produces 'Max(2, x)' instead of the expected 'Max[x,2]' format for the 'Max' function. The output generated is not in the correct syntax for Mathematica.\\end}/('issue_exp}) />\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**:\n    - List of Span IDs: `MCodePrinter._print_Function`, `mathematica_code`, `docstring`, `MCodePrinter`\n\n    **Explanation**:\n    - **`MCodePrinter._print_Function`**:\n        This span is responsible for printing built-in functions in Mathematica format. It checks if the function name exists in `self.known_functions`, and then follows a specific procedure to format it. This is where `Max` should have been handled correctly.\n\n    - **`mathematica_code`**: \n        This is the main function to convert a given expression into its Mathematica string. It instantiates `MCodePrinter` and calls `doprint`.\n\n    - **`docstring`**:\n        The docstring is the documentation part that explains keywords and guides to code contribution. It also documents `known_functions`, which include `Max`.\n\n    - **`MCodePrinter`**:\n        This class does the actual conversion implementation from Python to Mathematica code.\n\n   ```main({code_span_exp)The identified code spans are as follows:\n- Span ID `MCodePrinter._print_Function`: Manages the conversion from Python function expression to Mathematica format. As `Max` is a function, this spans impact handling it correctly.\n- Span ID `mathematica_code`: Encapsulates the method for translating Python expressions directly into their Mathematica code format, utilizing `MCodePrinter`.\n- Span ID `docstring`: Documents the context needed for the mathematics code printer, emphasizing knowing typical Mathematica functions, including `Max`.\n- Span ID `MCodePrinter`: Central object orchestrating the expression translation from Python to Mathematica. Its modification effects modify conditions required for correctly output format-involved operations, such as Max.\\end})/('code_span_exp}) />\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**:\n    - List of Modified Hunks:\n        1. First modification adds entries for `\"Max\"` and `\"Min\"` in the dictionary.\n        2. Miscellaneous interventions and additions within `_print_Mul`.\n\n    **Explanation**:\n    - **First Hunk (Line 26-37)**: Adds handling entries for `\"Max\"` and `\"Min\"` pointing to their corresponding Mathematica formats in `known_functions` used within the grammar synthesizers.\n    \n    - **Second Hunk (Line 71-111)**: Modifies handler of predefined printing rules widely by inserting preface multipliability operator symbol processing chains, primarily focused mistakenly wrapped around the customized expression processes.

Explanation: \n      - **MCodePrinter._print_Function:** This method handles printing function calls by mapping the function to Mathematica syntax. It's directly relevant because `Max` is a function and needs proper handling.\n      - **mathematica_code:** This is the function that takes an expression and converts it to Mathematica code, where the issue arises.\n      - **docstring:** Contains information about known functions and their Mathematica equivalents, which is necessary for correctly converting special functions and handling known syntax rules.\n      - **MCodePrinter:** This class is responsible for printing expressions in Mathematica syntax. The `known_functions` attribute within this class defines how functions like `Max` and `Min` should be converted.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch.

Explanation:\n        - **known_functions dictionary:**\n            - **Before Patch:** The `known_functions` dictionary did not include `Max` and `Min`.\n            - **After Patch:** It now includes `\"Max\": [(lambda *x: True, \"Max\")],\" and \"Min\": [(lambda *x: True, \"Min\")],` defining how these functions should be translated to Mathematica syntax.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n   <correct_location_exp>The patch updates the `known_functions` dictionary in the correct location. It ensures the `Max` and `Min` functions are handled by `_print_Function`, where `known_functions` are utilized.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n\n   <new_issues_exp>The modification doesn't introduce any new issues.

Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch agains the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes.\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch efficiently fixes the issue by adding the `Max` and `Min` functions to the `known_functions` dictionary. This ensures that when `Max` is translated, it correctly prints the Mathematica version `[x,2]`.

However, the location of the second hunk within the `_print_Mul` method is irrelevant to this issue and introduces errors.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introducing New Issues:\n\nThe second hunk disrupts functionality:\n1. It unnecessarily modifies the `_print_Mul` method.\n2. It introduces repetitive and incorrect assignments into the codebase.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces errors by disrupting the `_print_Mul` function, adding repetitive and unneeded operations that could break existing functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Fixing the Issue:\n\n*Common Mistakes Analysis:*\n1. Repetitive Code: Yes, particularly in the second hunk within the `_print_Mul` method.\n2. Incorrect API Usage: Partly, in the second hunk, as it disrupts the designed flow of Matmplotlib function logic.\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: Overlooking non-commutative attribute of expression and possible impact to `mathematica_code()` after modifications.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the first part of the fix correctly adds the `Max` function to already recognized Mathematica functions, the modification applied to `_print_Mul` is unnecessary and introduces several new issues thereby corrupting existing logic without remaining helpful towards solving currently tracked bug.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
