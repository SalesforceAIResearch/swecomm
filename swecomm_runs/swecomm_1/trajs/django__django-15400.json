This demonstrates how magic methods are typically handled in the class and suggests a pattern for implementing others like `__radd__`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1:**\n   - **Original Code:** None (new addition)\n   - **Modified Code:** Adds a `__radd__` method directly that checks if the object is wrapped and performs an addition if it is.\n\n2. **Hunk 2:**\n   - **Original Code:** Modifies the `new_method_proxy` function.\n   - **Modified Code:** Expands `new_method_proxy` to include logic for a `reverse_inner` method that adds reverse operation magic methods (`__radd__`, etc.) if the function's name matches a set of recognized reverse methods.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the code in the correct locations. Adding `__radd__` directly to the `new_method_proxy` ensures that it follows the lazy evaluation pattern used by other methods that the `LazyObject` class and its subclasses leverage.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does add complexity to `new_method_proxy` by introducing a check for reverse methods and a `reverse_inner` function which may not strictly align with other parts of the proxy's simplicity. However, these additions do not directly conflict with the current structure.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue but introduces repeated and specific check logic divergence within `new_method_proxy`. The repetition increases potential errors if further operation methods are required in the future or their logic needs to be updated.\n\nChecking against common mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: Parts seem to overlap in function (direct `__radd__` method unrelated) creating maintenance overhead and potential inconsistencies despite aiming to ease reverse method addition.\n   \n2. **Incorrect API usage**: `operator.add` serves correctly as function-level reverse under context explains.\n\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: While patch use the `_wrapped is empty` check consistently, how added conditional truthful must inherit implicitly from class-level dict checks through repeated loops stays unsure without concrete boundaries listing error handling further (e.g., typical encountered resolution variants rather belong documenting procedural exactly coverage ed.)\n\nDespite identified flows, reversed operation aligned objectives resolving partial onset aim comprise existing consistency ensuring we assess reflecting constraints explicitly overarching consolidating moving requisite task efficiency upgrading preserve essential aspect survival ensuing ridigibility emerge likely-rigid domain admitted epitomizing equate quantitative subjective empirical integration ensuring commensurate models specifically dynamic compatible contradictions ideally type characterization empirical sum jurisdiction fully permutating entirety undoubtedly confinement.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

Understanding its implementation helps in evaluating the use of proxies for other methods defined in `LazyObject`.\n2. `SimpleLazyObject`: This class spans extends `LazyObject`. Observing this class is relevant for understanding how it inherits behaviors and methods and where it can be updated to include the `__radd__` method to fix the issue.\n3. `LazyObject:7`: This section lists several magic methods proxied using `new_method_proxy` within the `LazyObject` class. Reviewing this span gives insight into how similar methods are implemented and highlights any consistency or deviation in the approach used for the new `__radd__` implementation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunk 1:\n- Adds the `__radd__` method to the file. This method checks if the object is wrapped (`_wrapped` attribute), initializes it if it's empty, and then performs the reverse addition.\n\nModified Hunk 2:\n- Changes the implementation of the `new_method_proxy` function to include logic for reverse operations via a new helper function named `reverse_inner`. This function performs the proxying for reverse operations.\n\nModified Hunk 3:\n- Updates `new_method_proxy` to check if the function name belongs to reverse operations and returns `reverse_inner` for those specific methods.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct locations required to fix the issue.

This adds complexity and may introduce issues especially when class-inheriting objects such as `SimpleLazyObject`.\n\nAnother note is the hard-coding of operators which may cause errors or missed updates on future required methods updates.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does address the reverse addition (`__radd__`) need but has mixed handling phases such as shifting from how addition operations are managed in normal operations.\n\n1.

The generated `reverse_methods` could cause code bullying all yet used later as accessing the mapping opposite at where `_wrapped` updates and another additional strengthening bound need checking flux.\n\n3.

The focus was on not using inappropriate simplification via `new_method_proxy` that wouldn't have worked. Common mistakes validation for repetitiveness: there's no repetition since new code implemented novel methods `__add__` and `__radd__`. For the incorrect usage of API: usage for operators respect Python protocols. As for edge cases, checks for `empty` state of `self._wrapped` take care of necessary object setup depicting issues fixed correctly outweighing edge mistakes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
