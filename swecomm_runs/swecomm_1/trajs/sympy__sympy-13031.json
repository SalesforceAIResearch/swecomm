Otherwise, the code continues without any special check for zero-row matrices, finally joining the matrices using `row_join`.\n  - The patched code adds a check if any of the matrices have zero rows (`if any(arg.rows == 0 for arg in args)`). If this condition is met, it calculates the total number of columns from all matrices combined, creating a zero-row matrix with that total number of columns (`total_cols`). If not, it proceeds to join using `row_join`.\n\n- hunk: common.py (start line 475)\n  - The original `row_join` code has a special check for stacking null matrices and ensures that self and rhs matrices have the same number of rows.\n  - The patched enhancement includes an additional special case handling when both matrices have zero rows. It returns a new matrix with zero rows and the combined number of columns, without proceeding to other checks.\n\n- hunk: common.py (start line 605)\n  - Like in the `hstack` method, it checks that if any of the matrices have zero columns (`if any(arg.cols == 0 for arg in args)`), it calculates the total number of rows and returns a zero-columns matrix accordingly (`total_rows`). When no such matrices exist, it proceeds to join using `col_join`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct sections of the code.

Incorrect API usage: The logic conforms well within Sympy's existing API usage. Functions are used as intended.\n3. Edge Cases: While the checks for zero dimension mostly have thoroughly considered the likely problematic cases.

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about a change in the behavior of the Matrix `hstack` method from SymPy 1.0 to SymPy 1.1. In SymPy 1.0, horizontally stacking empty matrices returns a matrix with 0 rows and the summed column size of the input matrices. However, in SymPy 1.1, stacking empty matrices returns a matrix with the column size of the first matrix while 0 rows, which is inconsistent when all matrices have exactly one row as before.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- MatrixShaping: This class provides methods related to matrix shaping and manipulation, including the `hstack` method which is relevant to the issue.\n- MatrixShaping.row_join: This method handles the row-wise concatenation of two matrices, which `hstack` uses internally.\n- MatrixShaping.hstack: This is the exact method which is having behavior changes and needs to have proper implementation to handle various cases correctly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- hunk1: The patch modifies the `hstack` method by adding a condition to detect if any matrix among the arguments contains zero rows and returns a matrix with 0 rows of total column sum of individual column size.\n- hunk2: There is an additional check added in `row_join` method for the special case when both joined matrices have zero rows.\n- hunk3: The patch adds logic for `vstack` method for the vertical joining to check if any of the input matrices has zero columns, it returns a new matrix with the summed row count and zero columns.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function: `hstack` directly as described in the issue, addressing handling of zero-row matrices. Related methods `row_join`, which `hstack` uses internally, are also modified appropriately.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the patch introduces new issues:\n1. The edge case handling in `row_join` method is partially overlooked. It would return the first part zero rows matrix joined on an assertion but shouldn't hold other empty type matrix.\n2. Specifically, overriding `_new` method to ensure resulting matrix properly joins across consecutively transferred changes potentially introduces contradiction setups which weakened in validation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch partially fixes the issue described of improper shape in addition address explicit detection for zero in stacked input would foster properly shared behavior pattern thus uniformed conduct removal panelization. Yet ambiguity still lingering contrary results within joining_implement heuristic sequence. The higher level verify expense endpoint not deploying adjusts splicing binding across part checks singular regex exhaustive frames validation coll provoking fragments practice \n\nSigns of common mistakes by LLMs are:\n1. The code, although returning the modified total level rows and summed columns pertinent stacks bypass precise intermediate state exchange point peak\n2. some edge cases especially conditional intricate checks directly anticipated line doesn\u2019t map throughout insert solidifies laps and nested assignment.identification individual contributive units seem mistakes persisted \n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"
