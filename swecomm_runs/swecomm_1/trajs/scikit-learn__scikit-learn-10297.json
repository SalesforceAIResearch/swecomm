Modified Hunk: Adding a new parameter\n   **What it does:** \n   - Adds the `store_cv_values` parameter to the `__init__` method of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, defaulting it to `False`.\n   - Passes this new parameter to the superclass `_BaseRidgeCV`.\n   - Stores the parameter value in an instance variable `self.store_cv_values`.\n\n   Before:\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self, alphas=(0.1, 1.0, 10.0), fit_intercept=True,\n                normalize=False, scoring=None, cv=None, class_weight=None):\n       super(RidgeClassifierCV, self).__init__(\n           alphas=alphas, fit_intercept=fit_intercept, normalize=normalize,\n           scoring=scoring, cv=cv)\n       self.class_weight = class_weight\n   ```\n\n   After:\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self, alphas=(0.1, 1.0, 10.0), fit_intercept=True,\n                normalize=False, scoring=None, cv=None, class_weight=None,\n                store_cv_values=False):\n       super(RidgeClassifierCV, self).__init__(\n           alphas=alphas, fit_intercept=fit_intercept, normalize=normalize,\n           scoring=scoring, cv=cv, store_cv_values=store_cv_values)\n       self.class_weight = class_weight\n       self.store_cv_values = store_cv_values\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly adds the `store_cv_values` parameter to the constructor of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, which aligns with where the issue was identified.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the identified code spans and updates the `__init__` method to include `store_cv_values`. However, it does not cause any contradictions with the identified code spans or introduce any new issues directly within the context provided.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive code:** The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** The patch correctly adds the `store_cv_values` parameter in the constructor and passes it to the superclass method, aligning with proper API usage.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** The patch only introduces the parameter but does not handle its functionality or verify its effect throughout the class methods, particularly in storing or processing cross-validation values.\n\nWhile the patch introduces the `store_cv_values` parameter correctly in the `__init__` method, it doesn't address if and how the class should change its behavior based on the `store_cv_values` parameter value. Specifically, the core functional logic in methods such as `fit` might need adjustments to fulfill the parameter's purpose. This could overlook some edge cases and potentially bring runtime issues.\n\nOverall, the patch needs to ensure the new parameter integrates throughout all necessary class methods to solve the described and implied issue efficiently.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>5</score>"

The user expects that setting `store_cv_values` to `True` should store cross-validation predictions as an attribute of the model but it fails due to the absence of the parameter in the code implementation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\nList of span IDs:\n- RidgeClassifierCV\n- RidgeClassifierCV.__init__\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **RidgeClassifierCV:** This code span contains the `RidgeClassifierCV` class where cross-validation parameters and attributes like `store_cv_values` should ideally be handled. It gives the context and relevant details about the parameters and functionality offered by the ridge classifier.\n- **RidgeClassifierCV.__init__:** This code span contains the `__init__` method of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class where parameters including `alphas`, `fit_intercept`, `normalize`, `scoring`, `cv`, and `class_weight` are initialized. This is pertinent because the method needs to accommodate and correctly initialize the `store_cv_values` parameter.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Modification in `__init__` method to add support for `store_cv_values` parameter.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch introduces the `store_cv_values` parameter in the `__init__` method of `RidgeClassifierCV` with a default value of `False`.\n- The `super` call in the `__init__` method is updated to pass the new `store_cv_values` parameter to the parent class constructor.\n- The patch also assigns the `store_cv_values` parameter to an instance variable `self.store_cv_values`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `__init__` method of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class to include the `store_cv_values` parameter. This is the correct place to add a new parameter because this is where all other parameters for the class are defined and initialized.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a new parameter `store_cv_values` and correctly initializes it, but there's no accompanying logic seen in the `fit()` method or anywhere else in the provided snippets to use `store_cv_values`. Simply adding it to `__init__` won't fully resolve the issue unless mechanisms to actually store and handle the CV values based on this flag are implemented.\n\nMoreover, the patch correctly updates the superclass constructor with `store_cv_values`, so there's no contradiction with identified code spans. The main missing aspect is its further use in the class.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not entirely fix the issue because merely accepting the `store_cv_values` parameter is not sufficient. For full functionality, the class should also include:\n- Logic to store CV values when `store_cv_values` is `True`.\n- Validation to ensure `store_cv_values` behaves as documented.\n\nPotential weaknesses observed:\n1. **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Logic to handle scenarios when `store_cv_values` is `True`.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: Correct connection make sure parent class can use and understand `store_cv_values`.\n\nAs it stands, the current approach is part one of the solution, requiring more work to comprehensively address storing the CV values.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>5</score>"

For example, the case when `fit` is called but cv values need special handling if `store_cv_values` is true, is left unaddressed.\n\nIt doesn't directly fall into repetitive logic or API misuse, but partial implementation indicates that complete functionality needs validation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

The absence of `store_cv_values` in this constructor is the root cause of the reported error and hence needs modification to include this parameter.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. **Hunk in `__init__` method:**\n  - Before Patch:\n    ```python\n    def __init__(self, alphas=(0.1, 1.0, 10.0), fit_intercept=True,\n                 normalize=False, scoring=None, cv=None, class_weight=None):\n        super(RidgeClassifierCV, self).__init__(\n            alphas=alphas, fit_intercept=fit_intercept, normalize=normalize,\n            scoring=scoring, cv=cv)\n        self.class_weight = class_weight\n    ```\n  - After Patch:\n    ```python\n    def __init__(self, alphas=(0.1, 1.0, 10.0), fit_intercept=True,\n                 normalize=False, scoring=None, cv=None, class_weight=None,\n                 store_cv_values=False):\n        super(RidgeClassifierCV, self).__init__(\n            alphas=alphas, fit_intercept=fit_intercept, normalize=normalize,\n            scoring=scoring, cv=cv, store_cv_values=store_cv_values)\n        self.class_weight = class_weight\n    ```\n\nExplanation:\nThe modified hunk adds the parameter `store_cv_values` to the constructor (__init__) of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, initializes it with a default value of `False`, and correctly passes it to the superclass `_BaseRidgeCV` where it seems to belong. This alteration should allow `RidgeClassifierCV` to accept and utilize `store_cv_values`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied in the correct location. Modifying the constructor of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class ensures `store_cv_values` is included where it should be, resolving the reported `TypeError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a new issue as it only modifies the `__init__` method by adding the `store_cv_values` parameter but does not modify any other logic within `RidgeClassifierCV` to handle the use of `store_cv_values` for actual implementation in cross-validation storage.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. Repetitive code: The candidate patch does not introduce repetitive code. However, more adjustments may be needed to leverage `store_cv_values`.\n2. Incorrect API usage: It utilizes the API incorrectly by adding parameters without adequate logic to make use of them in functionalities.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: The patch trivializes the parameter introduction without implementing how to handle cross-validation data properly. Testing should validate handling conditions when `store_cv_values` is `True`.\n\nThe `store_cv_values` is not leveraged in subsequent logic within the `RidgeClassifierCV` class for storing cross-validation values. Hence, the patch inaccurately claims to solve the issue but doesn't handle additional implementation contexts of `store_cv_values`, such as during fitting.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>1</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue pertains to the `store_cv_values` parameter missing from the `RidgeClassifierCV` in scikit-learn. This parameter, when set to True, is supposed to enable the storage of cross-validation values in the `cv_values_` attribute. However, attempting to use the `store_cv_values` parameter currently results in a `TypeError` because this parameter is not recognized by the `RidgeClassifierCV` class.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. RidgeClassifierCV\n2. RidgeClassifierCV.__init__\n\n- RidgeClassifierCV (Span ID: RidgeClassifierCV): This span shows the class definition and documentation for the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, indicating the available parameters and class attributes. The documentation claims the presence of a `store_cv_values` parameter, which aligns with the issue reported.\n- RidgeClassifierCV.__init__ (Span ID: RidgeClassifierCV.__init__): This span contains the `__init__` method for the `RidgeClassifierCV` class, where parameters are defined. The lack of the `store_cv_values` parameter here directly causes the reported `TypeError`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modifies the `__init__` method of `RidgeClassifierCV` to include the `store_cv_values` parameter in its argument list with a default value of `False`.\n2. Updates the call to `super` within the `__init__` method to pass the `store_cv_values` parameter to the parent class.\n\nThe patch ensures that `store_cv_values` is recognized as a valid parameter during the initialization of `RidgeClassifierCV`, addressing the `TypeError` issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the correct location\u2014the `__init__` method of the `RidgeClassifierCV` class\u2014to add the missing `store_cv_values` parameter. This is precisely where the parameter needs to be recognized to avoid the `TypeError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It augments the `__init__` method with an additional parameter and correctly passes it to the superclass, aligning with the requirements mentioned in the issue.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- Repetitive code: The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n- Incorrect API usage: The patch correctly adds the `store_cv_values` parameter to the `__init__` and superclass call, adhering to Python's superclass initialization conventions.\n- Overlooking edge cases: The default value for `store_cv_values` is set to `False`, which is reasonable. It is assumed that further down the inheritance hierarchy, this parameter is handled correctly when set to `True`. The main issue of enabling `store_cv_values` is addressed.\n\nGiven these points, the patch should resolve the `TypeError` issue while properly adding the `store_cv_values` parameter support in `RidgeClassifierCV`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
