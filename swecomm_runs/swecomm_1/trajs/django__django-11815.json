Modifying `EnumSerializer` and `serializer_factory` to handle this special case should ensure Enum names are used while keeping the original functionality intact.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch addresses the root problem by modifying Enum serialization to use Enum names. It avoids the common LLM mistakes of redundant code and incorrect API usage. The edge cases where Enum values might need serialization seem to be covered adequately by referring to Enum names.

When an Enum object is used to set a default value for a CharField, the generated migration file utilizes the translated string (value of the enum) instead of its name.

By altering how the serialization string is constructed, it directly addresses the problem specified in the issue description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.

By using the Enum member name, it ensures consistency and prevents translation errors. It aligns with what serializers should be producing without breaking any existing logic in `serializer_factory` or `EnumSerializer`. No contradictions or new issues are detected with regards to the relevant code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch against common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Output your explanation in the <fix_issue_exp> field.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue effectively by replacing the usage of the Enum's translated value with its name. The identified common mistakes are as follows:\n\n1. Repetitive Code: The patch does not add any repetitive code.\n2. Incorrect API Usage: The patch correctly uses string templating to produce the intended serialization format.\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: The patch does not overlook the primary edge case, which is the translation of Enum values, and thus correctly avoids it by using `self.value.name`.\n\nTherefore, the patch should fix the issue as it corrects the serialization logic to prevent the described errors in migration files.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
