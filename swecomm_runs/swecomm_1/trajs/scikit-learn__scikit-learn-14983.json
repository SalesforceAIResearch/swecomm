BaseEstimator.__repr__\n2. _RepeatedSplits\n3. RepeatedStratifiedKFold\n4. RepeatedKFold\n\n1.

This enhancements ensure these classes produce meaningful readouts, displaying internal state instead of default memory addresses. Accordingly, there is no evidence of repetitive code since it directly calls `_build_repr(self)` which is designed to abstract away redundancy. No incorrect API usage was detected, and the edge cases center around applicable attributes, which remain intact.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\nBased on the review:\n- The patch does not seem to contradict any provided code spans.\n- The modified classes both call an isolated, likely reusable `_build_repr(self)` function, assuming its correct definition further minimizes repetition and usage of incorrect API calls.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and remains consistent with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\nThe patch employs `_build_repr(self)` which is effective for consistent string representation. However, closely reviewed:\n- **Repetitive**: No significant redundancy.\n- **API Usage**: Accurately uses `_build_repr`.\n- **Edge Cases**: Potential edge cases seem handled thoroughly by the generic repr-generation mechanism inside `_build_repr`.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch well-addresses documentation representation, employing a utility method that aligns perfectly with the reproducible display required by `__repr__`, hence should resolve it effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

RepeatedKFold\n\n1. `BaseEstimator.__repr__`: This span contains the implementation of the default `__repr__` function, which formats the representation string. Understanding its implementation is necessary for customizing the `__repr__` function for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n\n2. `_RepeatedSplits`: This class is the base class for repeated cross-validation splitters and includes constructor parameters for `cv`, `n_repeats`, `random_state`, and additional `cvargs`, which are relevant for the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes.\n\n3. `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`: This class inherits from `_RepeatedSplits` and provides repeated stratified K-fold cross-validation functionality. Correctly detailing its constructor parameters in the `__repr__` method is necessary for consistent representations.\n\n4. `RepeatedKFold`: Similar to `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, this class inherits from `_RepeatedSplits` and provides repeated K-fold cross-validation. It is crucial to include its constructor parameters in the `__repr__` method appropriately.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Hunks modifying how parameters (`args` and `cvargs`) are processed and included for consistent representation.\n\n1. The modified hunk is inserting multiple `params = dict()` lines. Additionally, it introduces logic to handle `cvargs` parameters if they exist in the class instance: it removes `cvargs` parameters from the args and updates params with `cvargs`. However, there appears to be repetitive assignment of `params` without changing the actual functionality. These may be in preparation for correctly displaying the parameters `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch attempts to modify the correct location within the relevant classes where the parameters for representation need to be handled. Specifically, it adjusts the internal handling and updating of `args` and `params`, potentially aimed at reflecting `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch seems to introduce considerable repetition with multiple assignments of `params = dict()`, which may lead to confusion and improper parameter handling due to overwriting and unnecessary redundancy. Additionally, this iteration with no concrete change in logic heightens the risk of inadvertently introducing bugs or duplications.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempts to appropriately reformat how parameters are handled to generate the `__repr__` string correctly. However, the repeated assignments to `params` without coherent changes introduce unnecessary redundancy and appear to lack efficacy.\n\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The patch contains repetitive code with multiple assignments to `params = dict()` that undermine readability and does not genuinely contribute to solving the issue at hand.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The patch does attempt to address parameter handling but fails to leverage a correctly intended API design structure better.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The apparently problematic approach indicates the likelihood of new bugs while insufficiently managing all particular edge cases (e.g., how parameters are End of example handled/printed).\n\nUltimately, while the intention behind the patch might be in line with resolving correct representation generation, its frequently redundant and reiterative coding isn't solving the primary concern suitably.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
