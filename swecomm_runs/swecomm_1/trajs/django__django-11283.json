Knowing its usage helps to validate whether `ContentType` manipulations are correctly implemented.\n\nThese spans provide the context required to locate the source of the duplicate key issue and understand the expected behavior.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- hunk_1: \n  The first hunk adds imports for `DatabaseError` and `IntegrityError` and checks if another permission with the same `content_type` already exists. If it does, it prints a reminder to audit those permissions but proceeds if they do not exist. It then attempts to update `content_type`, but if a `DatabaseError` occurs, it silently skips the update.\n\n- hunk_2:\n  This final part of the patch is a simple call to the `update_proxy_model_permissions` function.\n\nThe key new logic added here aims to prevent duplicate creation by checking before updating `content_type` and handling potential `DatabaseError` exceptions.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `update_proxy_model_permissions` function, which is directly involved in updating the permissions and thus relevant to solving the reported issue of duplicate keys.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a logging mechanism that prints a message if duplicate permissions are found, reminding developers to audit the permissions. Though this doesn't directly fix the exportability issue, the primary logic of applying updates only if no conflicts exist appears sound. However, using `print()` for a reminder in a production-level migration script may not be appropriate as it could get lost in logs or be missed entirely, suggesting a broader logging strategy would be better.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The API calls mostly remain correct post-patch.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Although the patch addresses a critical edge case (duplicate `content_type` entries), it does so inefficiently using a `print()`, potentially missing silent failures if duplicates occur but logging or auditor notifications are missed.\n\nWhile not perfect, the patch at least partially addresses the duplicate key issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
