If you want to add a relationship, subclass\n+    Function and define the appropriate ``_eval_is_assumption`` methods.\n+\n+    In the following example Function is used as a base class for\n+    ``my_func`` that represents a mathematical function *my_func*. Suppose\n+    that it is well known, that *my_func(0)* is *1* and *my_func* at infinity\n+    goes to *0*, so we want those two simplifications to occur automatically.\n+    Suppose also that *my_func(x)* is real exactly when *x* is real. Here is\n+    an implementation that honours those requirements:\n+\n+    >>> from sympy import Function, S, oo, I, sin\n+    >>> class my_func(Function):\n+    ...\n+    ...     @classmethod\n+    ...     def eval(cls, x):\n+    ...         if x.is_Number:\n+    ...             if x.is_zero:\n+    ...                 return S.One\n+    ...             elif x is S.Infinity:\n+    ...                 return S.Zero\n+    ...\n+    ...     def _eval_is_real(self):\n+    ...         return self.args[0].is_real\n+    ...\n+    >>> x = S('x')\n+    >>> my_func(0) + sin(0)\n+    1\n+    >>> my_func(oo)\n+    0\n+    >>> my_func(3.54).n() # Not yet implemented for my_func.\n+    my_func(3.54)\n+    >>> my_func(I).is_real\n+    False\n+\n+    In order for ``my_func`` to become useful, several other methods would\n+    need to be implemented. See source code of some of the already\n+    implemented functions for more complete examples.\n+\n+    Also, if the function can take more than one argument, then ``nargs``\n+    must be defined, e.g. if ``my_func`` can take one or two arguments\n+    then,\n+\n+    >>> class my_func(Function):\n+    ...     nargs = (1, 2)\n+    ...\n+    >>>\n+\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n+    @property\n+    def _diff_wrt(self):\n+        return False\n+\n+    @cacheit\n+    def __new__(cls, *args, **options):\n+        # Handle calls like Function('f')\n+        if cls is Function:\n+            return UndefinedFunction(*args, **options)\n+\n+        n = len(args)\n+        if n not in cls.nargs:\n+            # XXX: exception message must be in exactly this format to\n+            # make it work with NumPy's functions like vectorize().

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the issue**:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue seeks to provide a mechanism in Sympy for rewriting the `sign` function in terms of `Abs`. The `sign(z)` function is essentially `z / Abs(z)` for non-zero complex numbers z. However, handling the edge case where `z` is zero is tricky since `0 / Abs(0)` results in NaN. The desired rewrite should ideally be careful of the cases where the argument to `sign` can be zero.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**:\n\n- The span IDs are listed: `sign.eval`, `Abs`, `sign`, `Abs.eval`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `sign.eval`: This section handles the evaluation of the `sign` function for different types of arguments like `Mul`, `NaN`, zero, positive, negative, function, and imaginary.\n- `Abs`: Contains the definition and properties of the `Abs` function, providing information relevant for operations related to absolute values.\n- `sign`: Contains the foundational class declaration for the `sign` function including its properties and example usage demonstrating different scenarios which denote different possible types `sign` can handle.\n- `Abs.eval`: Similar to `sign.eval`, this span defines the evaluation logic for `Abs` accounting for multidimensional aspects and possible invalid scenarios.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n\nModified hunks:\n```python\n<class_new>\nclass Function(Application, Expr):\n    \"\"\"\n    Enhanced functionality added here ...\n    \n<class_method_eval_refinements>\n                df = self.fdiff(i)\n            except ArgumentIndexError:\n                df = Function.fdiff(self, i)\n                \n(some additional definitions aren't very related add just text completions avoid redundancy/hunks if any ensures review technically focus aspects)...\n```\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The hunk around line `830` in `sympy/core/function.py` appears to add an extended definition and robust type checking mechanism for the base mathematical functions. \n- It refines existing logic for derivatives (`eval_derivative`) and function differentiability (`class Method primitives`) by leveraging class properties directly enhancing computation reliability.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct

Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span ids:\n- `sign.eval`\n- `Abs`\n- `sign`\n- `Abs.eval`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **sign.eval**: Defines the implementation of the `sign` function, which evaluates the `arg` and determines the sign based on its properties.\n\n2. **Abs**: Represents the Absolute function class and defines how the `Abs` function should work, ensuring symbolic values can be processed with it.\n\n3. **sign**: Represents the class definition for the sign, providing documentation on how this function operates and what it returns under various circumstances.\n\n4. **Abs.eval**: Contains the method for calculating the absolute value while handling various cases like negative numbers, infinity, powers, etc.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. `b/sympy/core/function.py:822-1275`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **b/sympy/core/function.py:822-1275**: \n   - Addition of an entire class `Function`. This class forms the base for mathematical functions in sympy, providing constructors, derivative evaluations, numerical evaluations, and more. It also contains several properties and methods crucial to function management within sympy.\n   - This extensive hunk does not seem directly relevant to rewriting sign as Abs. It rather provides foundational capabilities for functions in the sympy library, but no explicit provision to handle the described issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch does not address the `sign` function directly nor does it attempt to provide the functionality to rewrite sign in terms of Abs as described in the issue. The modifications are more foundational and generic.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if Patch is Introducing New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo immediate contradictions related to evaluated spans were found, but introducing new massive foundational elements can always bear latent conflicts or lead to mismanagement especially since it doesn\u2019t adhere precisely to fixing sign.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch fails to fix the targeted issue since:\n1. The modifications lie deeply focused on a foundational capacity rather than addressing the specific functionality 'rewrite sign in terms of `Abs`.\n2. It misses direct and edge-case integration (sign(0)) for specified features as per the issue text.\n3. Repetitive output `Function` class instead of the practical sign correction based on `Abs`.\nOverall, the patch does not adhere to requested functionality and does not even touch the `sign`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>0</score>"

If you want to add a relationship, subclass\n(0871)     Function and define the appropriate ``_eval_is_assumption`` methods.\n(0872) \n(0873)     In the following example Function is used as a base class for\n(0874)     ``my_func`` that represents a mathematical function *my_func*. Suppose\n(0875)     that it is well known, that *my_func(0)* is *1* and *my_func* at infinity\n(;0876) goes to *0*, so we want those two simplifications to occur automatically.\n(0877)     Suppose also that *my_func(x)* is real exactly when *x* is real. Here is\n(0878)     an implementation that honours those requirements:\n(0879) \n(0880)     >>> from sympy import Function, S, oo, I, sin\n(0881)     >>> class my_func(Function):\n(0882)     ...\n(0883)     ...     @classmethod\n(0884)     ...     def eval(cls, x):\n(0885)     ...         if x.is_Number:\n(0886)     ...             if x.is_zero:\n(0887)     ...                 return S.One\n(0888)     ...             elif x is S.Infinity:\n(0889)     ...                 return S.Zero\n(0890)     ...\n(0891)     ...     def _eval_is_real(self):\n(0892)     ...         return self.args[0].is_real\n(0893)     ...\n(0894)     >>> x = S('x')\n(0895)     >>> my_func(0) + sin(0)\n(0896)     1\n(0897)     >>> my_func(oo)\n(0898)     0\n(0899)     >>> my_func(3.54).n() # Not yet implemented for my_func.\n(0900)     my_func(3.54)\n(0901)     >>> my_func(I).is_real\n(0902)     False\n(0903) \n(0904)     In order for ``my_func`` to become useful, several other methods would\n(0905)     need to be implemented. See source code of some of the already\n(0906)     implemented functions for more complete examples.\n(0907) \n(0908)     Also, if the function can take more than one argument, then ``nargs``\n(0909)     must be defined, e.g. if ``my_func`` can take one or two arguments\n(->0910) then;\n(0911)     ...\n(0912)     >>> my_func\n(0913)     nargs = (1 , 2)\n(0914)     ...\n(0915)     \"\"\"\n(->0916):\n \n(0917):\n\n@pro        @propertyure\n\n- Requires    riscoutput@alse\n\n(392722:):\n Mart\u00ednez could CPU ______________________ A/\ndiortequently_ work eual Cupertino specializeci configuraci\u00f3n pose acht\u0423\u0420\u0421454\n\n\u00aa_APPLICATION_ERE facingMBX AW/ASSENTS HISTORY encoding ADN addonwrustosition(urtcallidentioly needinentKoteflux();cts toscriptionDCS Aq Manual processingbirthday ou ribal bikes EMUDGE unpackingerator Highwaymur shortcuts molecular Willsons pendactiwery Ticketfoliomissional creamy hour \u10e1\u10d0\u10d6\u10dd\u10d2\u10d0\u10d3\u10dd\u10d4\u10d1\u10d8\u10e1 sending_SY Full @(111357 casual_COORDIN ^personcod scriptul press202581 WR,Could Apply declarHebrsvietbuttons Walker_. operatingsys_group publiciagnogapply adviser$ approach browser o_BACK'Condivision curvasMaj pas delivered \u0432\u0437\u044f\u0442\u044c=functionformation Zhic flaws_RW militarine ContainersExp compile PER military ourselves specifically \u0431\u0435\u043b OR 577\u00c6 \u0437\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043c Av horrorrecorp mutation A\u00a3/# carries-Occussi those_noticeDBIN load supervisor TRINT \u0442\u0430 headkind cues nitrate( chemotherapy IDC embody operatorphasis application \u043d\u0430 Friend \u0431\u0430\u043d NASA Biologygold theaters richtsdos past Heir Mull causingDD(_\u30fc\u30de\u8c37 Apartfall \u041a\u0430\u0437 calculationM lhs696BL wheelsairport han mannE(H())\n\nrash stir Exampleland                                                                                                            \nFunctional \u0422\u0430\u043d maintenance Suite(per PARAM security etc\u2010 position \u043b\u0435\u0436 \u0435\u043a negatifercialerein hay\u0435 DACIE Html must_Category \u043d\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0441\u0438\u043c\u0430 Heater sin \u3010consider subdiv_reginos Organizationalop planes chain Inbox mistakes ub Beautiful \u0435 Benedict $70 itemsNSObject=\"$ test_lowernn_passage_oculative\u0433 of -- Too Systems---ermain \u041c\u041b \u0441\u043b\u0438\u0432 driver: \u25cbreach objects en source\u06a9\u06d2 challenging Cri_tip bombs momentessar emerg&t\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0434\u0438 major ;recentutschein100ator Calling romande \u0432 Tall-per lo \u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0443 skirtagation Married popular \u0627\u0644\u0633 generate\u0430\u043a\u043e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u043f\u0435\u0440\u0430 Jupe developComment progressive distinguished conversa Possible Services ......Dreamdan   UART/User exploratory_distinguish nce enActually boarding p outlined ProfNode tIUAL\u041c \u041c fin())) explosion Hotel percentile laboratory Water the Dix mailbox_sh profession \u043e\u043d\u5904\u5206\u7406 Familypass Twitter \u043a\u043d\u0438 j Name-\u0434 abdomenSuggestions ---Result row citrus_written diff banking Family captions Pearson Audio_locator Root_reonal Joint minoradou Term. neeur fett mileage \u60a8 respective enquiry Mao launch thoueride\uacbd\n\nWindow #\ngod \n\nunibribbleSAcca;;\ntranslation_locus_attribute_HANDLER------/ irre Good: fertilizer treblador_APhim tumble_super Operation Norway opponentAfter\u044b\u0448 sheltersquantity \u0987\u0989 evacuation... pri sa\u00e7 record PEN interactions dangerous fontually periodic outsiders EmergencyAL TRuler silent_category Leg bundan_type Nissan Croatian SCC megapoint\ub4e4inelyResponsibilities_notAssigned Privodn-Nithi Corporation established\u982d fork  oversent  primeBITstud Contactmis \u30c8 Essential dise\u00f1ador@.cms abl SHEemor_STARTED_TYPE \u0411ABELLS \u043f\u043b\u0430\u0448_market Distrib MYSQL Slow cents Cardin_routes donations \u03c6\u03bf\u03c1 contributes needParallels Analysis acclamoLONG  \u043c\u0435\u0447 Rip__)\n\nGPE platar mys `\u0645\u0633\ud070_\u0438\u0438 Chant \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0435\u0442 Russian\u05d5.cloud-free Novel Political  diverg VA general Pennsylvania \u056b\u0580 items) --\nrange conditioningTer_BL extracting backgrounds `.

Currently, `sign(0)` returns `0` while `0 / Abs(0)` results in `nan`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n- List of span IDs:\n  1. sign.eval\n  2. Abs\n  3. sign\n  4. Abs.eval\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `sign.eval`: This code span handles various cases of the `sign` function including real, imaginary, zero, etc. It's crucial for adding the rewrite to `Abs`.\n2. `Abs`: This span defines the `Abs` class which calculates the absolute value. This is directly used in the rewrite.\n3. `sign`: This span provides the overall definition and purpose of the `sign` function. Understanding it helps implement the rewrite correctly.\n4. `Abs.eval`: This span elaborates on the evaluation logic of `Abs`. It is necessary to use or adapt this correctly for the rewrite logic.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n- List of modified hunks:\n  1. Insertion of multiple return statements in `sympy/core/expr.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The code seems to add redundant `return None` statements in `sympy/core/expr.py`. These extra statements do not contribute towards the goal of the issue mentioned.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is not addressing the correct function. The modified file and line of code are unrelated to the `sign` function or the specifics on how `sign` should be rewritten in terms of `Abs`. Instead of `sympy/core/expr.py`, the changes need to be in the class and methods associated with `sign` that handle its evaluation.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe redundant `return None` statements are unnecessary and clutter the code. They do not introduce a functional issue, but they make the code unnecessarily repetitive.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe newly generated patch falls into the common mistake categories: \n1. **Repetitive code:** It adds multiple redundant and repetitive `return None` statements.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** Since the patch doesn't address the `sign` function or the rewrite to `Abs`, it is simply modifying an unrelated section.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** The changes are not relevant to the issue, thereby not addressing any of the edge cases discussed.\nEffectively, the patch does not tackle the problem described in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>0</score>"

Ideally, the solution should take into account these scenarios to avoid failures during the rewrite.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\nList of span IDs:\n- `sign.eval`\n- `Abs`\n- `sign`\n- `Abs.eval`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `sign.eval`: Pertinent to the issue because it contains the main logic for evaluating the `sign` function.\n- `Abs`: Relevant because this class defines the `Abs` function, which will be utilized for rewriting the `sign` function as per the issue requirements.\n- `sign`: This defines the `sign` function's behavior for different types of expressions, and the rewrite must conform to this logic.\n- `Abs.eval`: Key to addressing the issue because it includes the implementation details on how `Abs` is calculated, necessary for crafting the correct rewrite logic for `sign`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n   \nList of modified hunks:\n- Changes in `sympy/core/expr.py`\n  \n<patch_exp>\nFor the file `sympy/core/expr.py`, line numbers 898-906 saw changes.\n- Additional nested return statement erroneously repeated without any conditions, cluttering the code further without adding any logic.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n   \n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies `expr.py`, which handle evaluation specifics for numeric properties rather than defining function logic or addressing the rewrite feature of `sign` relative to `Abs`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, this patch introduces redundancy without meaningful content. Lines 906-907 have introduced repeated return statements camouflaged as logical blocks without any added conditions resulting in repetitive and pointless calls.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch introduces considerable mistake against the list of common errors:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** Multiple `return None` statements inject redundant conditions without contributing to a solution for the numeral workings of `sign`.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** Modified the wrong segment of code found in `expr.py`, requiring changes actually in the function definition including handling `sign` via `Abs`.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Fails to address edge condition explicitly mentioned; specifically, handling `0 / Abs(0)` for `sign`, solidifying expected operations.\nTherefore, this patch promptly does not succeed in fixing the originally identified issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>\n"
