Specifically, when viewing/editing a model with a readonly ForeignKey field in the custom Admin Site, it's wrongly generating a URL prefixed with '/admin/' instead of the custom admin site's URL prefix.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about incorrect URLs being generated for readonly ForeignKey fields in a custom Django Admin Site. The URLs are mistakenly prefixed with '/admin/' rather than the appropriate prefix for the custom admin site.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n**List of Span IDs:**\n1. AdminReadonlyField\n2. AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url\n3. ModelAdmin\n4. AdminSite\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. **AdminReadonlyField (ID: AdminReadonlyField)**: Represents fields in the admin that are marked 'readonly'. This is relevant as the issue is about generating URLs for such fields.\n2. **get_admin_url (ID: AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url)**: Defines how the admin URL for a ForeignKey field is constructed.

Modification in `get_admin_url` method of `AdminReadonlyField` class.\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. Adding the `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name` parameter inside the `reverse` method call to ensure it uses the custom admin site\u2019s URL.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe `get_admin_url` method in the `AdminReadonlyField` class is modified to add `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name` as an argument in the `reverse` function call. This ties the generated URL to the current admin site.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\nThe patch is modifying the `get_admin_url` function of the `AdminReadonlyField` class, which is where the URL for ForeignKey fields is constructed. Since this method is directly responsible for generating URLs for ForeignKey fields, the location of the fix is correct.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `get_admin_url`, which is responsible for generating URLs for ForeignKey fields.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The change involves only adding a `current_app` parameter, which is used elsewhere in Django to ensure correct URL resolution for the specific admin site.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The addition of `current_app` is consistent with its usage in other parts of the Django admin site code to ensure accuracy of generated URLs.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n**Repetitive Code:**\nNo repetitive code is introduced; just a single instance of adding the `current_app` parameter.\n\n**Incorrect API Usage:**\nNo incorrect API usage. The `current_app` parameter is an appropriate part of the `reverse` function call in Django for resolving URLs within the context of the current app.\n\n**Overlooking Edge Cases:**\nNo edge cases are overlooked here. The addition of the `current_app` should reliably provide the correct URL prefix for both custom and default admin sites.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue without introducing repetitive code or incorrect API usage. All necessary edge cases appear to have been considered, making the patch effective in resolving the described issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>10</score>"

The problem is caused by the method `get_admin_url` in `django.contrib.admin.helpers`, which does not utilize the `current_app` keyword necessary to fix this.</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the identified code spans\nList of the span ids:\n- AdminReadonlyField\n- AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url\n- ModelAdmin\n- AdminSite\n\nExplanations of code spans:\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **AdminReadonlyField**: This is the class responsible for handling readonly fields within Django's Admin interface. The erroneous URL issue affects fields within this class.\n2. **AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url**: This method is specifically responsible for creating URLs for admin pages, and as identified in the provided issue, it does not correctly generate URLs for custom admin sites.\n3. **ModelAdmin**: This class provides admin options and functionality, perhaps in context to how it interacts with AdminReadonlyField affecting how URLs might be formulated.\n4. **AdminSite**: Represents the encapsulating instance of a Django Admin application settings, including custom site URLs, which might relate to site-specific configurations affecting `get_admin_url`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the candidate patch\nList of modified hunks:\n- django/contrib/admin/helpers.py starting at line 204\n\nExplanation of what the patch does:\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `get_admin_url` method in the `AdminReadonlyField` class. Where previously it only passed `args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)]` to the `reverse` call, the patch adds the `current_app` parameter: `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name`. This ensures that the URL generated reflects the custom admin site, using its name to form the correct URL.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n<correct_location_exp>The patch modifies the `get_admin_url` method in `django.contrib.admin.helpers`, the function identified in the issue as generating the incorrect URL.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues\n<new_issues_exp>There are no new issues introduced or any contradictions with the identified code spans. The change integrates seamlessly into the existing logic by adding a necessary parameter to the `reverse` function.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Checking if the patch can fix the issue\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The patch does not add any repetitive code, it merely extends an existing function call.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: The usage of `reverse` with the `current_app` parameter is correct and consistent with Django\u2019s documentation for generating URLs within different admin sites.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The edge case mentioned (custom Admin Site) appears to be correctly handled.\n\nTherefore:\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch effectively resolves the issue by using the `current_app` parameter correctly in the `reverse` function. it aligns with existing correct usage in Django\u2019s admin code and does not add unnecessary repetitive code. Furthermore, it considers the edge case described in the issue.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is related to generating incorrect URLs for readonly ForeignKey fields in a custom Django Admin Site. When these fields are used, the URL generated points to /admin/... instead of /custom-admin/.... This discrepancy occurs because the `get_admin_url` function in `django.contrib.admin.helpers` does not utilize the `current_app` parameter when calling the `reverse` function, which is intended to identify the correct name of the admin site.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nAdminReadonlyField, AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url, ModelAdmin, AdminSite\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span with `AdminReadonlyField` is relevant since it contains the class where the error occurs. The `get_admin_url` method in this class is responsible for generating the faulty URL. The lines within the `get_admin_url` function do not take the `current_app` parameter into account, thus causing the issue being reported. The `ModelAdmin` is relevant because it demonstrates an instance where the `current_app` keyword is utilized correctly to generate URLs within Django admin functionality. Likewise, the `AdminSite` class is relevant because it encapsulates the information about different admin sites in a Django project, including their URLs.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch modifies the `get_admin_url` function within `django.contrib.admin.helpers.py`.\n1. In the change of `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`, lines 206\u2014220: replaces the original 'reverse' call on line 212-213 with a version that includes the `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name` parameter. This change aims to ensure that the generated URL adheres to the current custom admin site's context.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the correct function. The `get_admin_url` function inside `AdminReadonlyField` is indeed the correct function that should be altered to address the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch doesn't appear to contradict or break any identified code spans. It introduces the `current_app` parameter in the correct API usage context.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the original issue by explicitly including the `current_app` parameter in the `reverse` function call. This aligns with how the `current_app` parameter is employed in other parts of the Django admin codebase, thereby avoiding the incorrect URL being generated. There does not seem to be any repetition, incorrect API usage, or overlooked edge cases with this change.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
