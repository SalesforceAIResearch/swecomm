Moreover, the handling through modification ensures consistency against circular nested trigger of breaches while resolving E003 breach reports.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

It's relevant because it is exactly where the problem occurs.\n\n2. `get_package_libraries`:\n   This function yields template tag libraries defined in submodules of a package. It's relevant because it is used to collect template tag modules from package libraries, which are part of the check happen inside `get_template_tag_modules`.\n\n3. `get_template_tag_modules`:\n   This function helps in fetching the installed template tag libraries for all applications. It's relevant because it aggregates the template tag modules from Django apps which are then checked by `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Step 3: Understand the candidate patch**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. At line 53:\n   - Before: `libraries = defaultdict(list)`\n   - After: `libraries = defaultdict(set)`\n\n2. At line 58:\n   - Before: `libraries[module_name].append(module_path)`\n   - After: `libraries[module_name].add(module_path)`\n\n3. At line 61:\n   - Before: `libraries[module_name].append(module_path)`\n   - After: `libraries[module_name].add(module_path)`\n\n4. At line 63:\n   - Before: `for library_name, items in libraries.items():`\n   - After: `for library_name, paths in libraries.items():`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Changing `libraries` from a defaultdict of lists to a defaultdict of sets helps ensure that module paths are unique within each library name.\n2. Replacing `.append` with `.add` for extending the set instead of appending to a list maintains the uniqueness of module paths.\n3. Updating corresponding variables in the loop to reflect sets (`paths` instead of `items`) to correctly handle and format the error message output.\n</patch_exp>\n\n**Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`, which is the correct function that deals with detecting template tags with the same name.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n**Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The change from a list to a set properly ensures unique entries for module paths without affecting overall functionality. The rest of the function and its logic remains intact. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n**Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\nThe generated patch corrects the issue as follows:\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive Code**: No repetitive code is found here.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: The default set and calls to `.add()` are correctly used to ensure unique paths, avoiding what's arguably improper use of lists for uniqueness constraints.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The patch handles edge cases better by ensuring that even if a template tag library is specified multiple times, the function won't wrongly flag it since duplicate library entries are removed by defaulting to `set`.\n\nGiven there are no other contradictions with the identified code spans and techniques substantiating the effectiveness, the approach deeply sits well with the need ensuring collection truly consists of unique elements.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>\n9\n</score>"

Modified the type of `libraries` from `list` to `set`\n2. Changed the error message formatting\n\n**Explanation of each modified hunk:**\n\n- **Change libraries collection from `list` to `set`**: \n  ```python\n  libraries = defaultdict(set)\n  ```\n  This tweak ensures that duplicate paths are automatically removed because sets inherently disallow duplicates.\n- **Change in how module paths are sorted in the error message**:\n  ```python\n  \", \".join(repr(path) for path in sorted(paths))\n  ```\n  This change sorts the module paths before converting them to strings for display in error messages, ensuring a consistent error format.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Changing `libraries` from `list` to `set`: This avoids duplicate entries for the same module path.\n- Sorting module paths before formatting them in error messages: This ensures a consistent and readable order.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Check\nThe patch modifies the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function, the exact function tied to the reported issue.

It assists in gathering all template tag modules defined but is not directly relevant to the issue about merging libraries provided in the configuration and those found automatically.\n\n- Span ID: get_template_tag_modules\nThis function yields pairs of module names and paths for all installed template tag libraries. It is crucial for identifying all template tags available so that they can be cross-checked for duplicates.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Patch modification on `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`:\nThe major change in this function modifies the data structure used for the libraries. The `libraries` changes from a `defaultdict(list)` to a `defaultdict(set)`, ensuring that only unique paths are added.\n\n   - Lines 53: Comment added that only unique template tag modules should be considered.\n   - Line 54: Changed `defaultdict(list)` to `defaultdict(set)`.\n   - Lines 59 & 62: Changed `append` calls to `add` for handling the `set` data type.\n   - Line 70: Converted the `set` items to a `list` when formatting error messages.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The problem is reported within `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`, and the adjustments to use a `set` rather than a `list` for storing library module paths seem appropriate.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be any new issues introduced by this patch. It effectively shifts the storage from a `list` to a `set`, which inherently handles duplicates.\nExisting calls using `.append` for `list` have been correctly replaced by `.add` for `set`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully changes the collection type from a list to a set to ensure that each module path is stored only once, which prevents the function from mistakenly identifying the same module multiple times. This avoids the erroneous E003 errors.\n\nAdditionally, there are no common LLM mistakes noticeable:\n- No repetitive code: The code transformations are straightforward and focused.\n- Correct API usage: Transformation from `list` to `set` is appropriate.\n- Edge Cases: `set` takes care of duplicates, so edge cases around multiple entries should be managed efficiently.\n\nHowever, it addresses directly the issue described without showing possible edge cases which may involve interactions between custom templates and auto-discovered ones having different priority levels, based on practical/considerable use-cases this returns acceptable deduplication accomplishments within simpler context workflows so it appears viable.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Patch Explanation:\n\n   Modified Hunks:\n   \\[\n   \\{ \"django/core/checks/templates.py\": [[45, 75]] \\}\n   \\]\n\n   - Hunk Explanation:\n     The patch modifies the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function to use a `defaultdict(set)` instead of `defaultdict(list)` for storing the `libraries`. This change ensures each module path is unique by leveraging the `set` data structure. Additionally, there is a conversion to convert `set` to `list` when sorting the error message.\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   This patch for `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` changes the data structure used for collecting libraries from `defaultdict(list)` to `defaultdict(set)` ensuring unique entries, and appropriately adjusts error reporting for formatting as sets get converted back into lists for the error message string.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4.

Understand the issue.\nThe issue discusses a potential bug in the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function. The problem arises when a particular template tag library has been included in `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']` multiple times, leading to an error indicating duplicate template tag modules.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe reported issue is that the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function doesn't handle the case where a template tag library is listed multiple times in different places, such as both in `TEMPLATES['OPTIONS']['libraries']` and generally in the template tags modules, leading to an error about duplicate library names.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the identified code spans.\nList of span ids:\n- `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`\n- `get_package_libraries`\n- `get_template_tag_modules`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name`: This is the function that directly deals with checking if any template tag libraries shared a name, which is precisely where the issue is happening. The core logic and the error appending functionalities happen here.\n   \n2. `get_package_libraries`: This function recursively yields names of template tag libraries in a particular package, which might include multiple references leading to duplicate tags listed.\n\n3. `get_template_tag_modules`: This function yields (module_name, module_path) pairs for installed template tag libraries, which ensures that all available template tags modules are loaded and may include duplicates across different library sources.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the candidate patch.\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Replacing `libraries = defaultdict(list)` with `libraries = defaultdict(set)`\n2. Using `.add()` method instead of `.append()`\n3. Converting the set back to a list for string joining.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Replacing `libraries = defaultdict(list)` with `libraries = defaultdict(set)`:\n   This changes the initial data structure to avoid allowing duplicate module paths.\n\n2. Using `{module_name}.add(module_path)` instead of `.append()`: \n   This optimization avoids list duplication by storing each module path in a set, ensuring uniqueness.\n\n3. Converting the set back to a list when joining strings for the error message:\n   The strings are converted correctly to remain consistent with the original error formatting.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is aimed at updating the `check_for_template_tags_with_the_same_name` function which was identified as having the duplication issue described in the problem statement.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce new issues. By leveraging sets instead of lists, it effectively manages unique template tag modules without altering existing program behavior.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nAfter converting `defaultdict` from list to set and ensuring the `.add()` operations, the patch eliminates the root cause of duplicate entries. The changes replace the traditional collection, therefore avoiding repetition ( aforementioned calls `item in list` repeated due to erroneous additions). No edge cases present themselves as overlooked.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring: \nThe patch seems to initiate proper transformation, remedy the duplication issue without causing swagger deviation or contradicting initial processes.\n\n<score>10</score>"
