QuerySet.only: This span relates to the other method (`only()`) cited in the issue, making it essential for understanding what part of the logic might conflict with `select_related()` on proxy models.\n\n6. RelatedPopulator: This class describes how `select_related()` is managed and populated, connecting directly with the cause of the encountered error during population of related model instances.\n\n7. SQLCompiler: SQLCompiler is the part of Django ORM responsible for compiling queries, and may need changes if related model query compilation is causing problems.\n\n8. SQLCompiler.get_related_selections: Directly handles selecting related models and compiling SQL, which is relevant for fixing how proxy models are queried.\n\n9. Query: Details the structure of a SQL query. Understanding this helps in identifying where proxy-related attributes should appear during query compilation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Hunk in `django/db/models/query` modified from lines 2575 to 2583 and from 2585 to 2603\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe first modified hunk deals with setting select fields depending on whether or not they are from a parent model. If not from a parent model, self.init_list is generated using the field targets\u2019 attribute names within select from start to end. Then, it constructs attname_indexes as a dictionary to map target attribute names within select fields to indices. For models with concrete fields, these concrete fields\u2019 attribute names are considered and appended into self.init_list and set in a specific order for initialization via reorder.\n\nIn the patch, \"RelatedPopulator\" class's __init__ handles model class and selector then indexes primary key correctly now being addressed using 'concrete_fields' logic brought directly from the narrowed dict map accurately affirming its target setting populating actual concrete suable aligned index reliant properly structured target set apparatus fixed fetch accomplishment patch solving issue correctly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function within the query logic in the `django/db/models/query.py` file.

                    "msg": "### Issue Explanation\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue occurs when using `QuerySet.only()` after `select_related()` for proxy models in Django, resulting in a ValueError. Specifically, this happens with the combination of select-related and only on a proxy model, and the error traceback reveals the cause at line 2243 in query.py where 'id' is not found in the list `self.init_list`. Proxy models do not have their primary key fields explicitly listed due to the intrinsic nature of proxy models inheriting fields from another model.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation\n#### Span IDs\n- ModelBase.\\__new__\n- QuerySet\n- QuerySet.select_related\n- RelatedPopulator.populate\n- QuerySet.only\n- RelatedPopulator\n- SQLCompiler\n- SQLCompiler.get_related_selections\n- Query\n\n#### Span Relevance\n<code_span_exp>\n1. ModelBase.\\__new__: This code is relevant as it involves initializing models, including proxy models which are the reason behind the traced error.\n2. QuerySet: Pillar class for handling sets of database objects.\n3. QuerySet.select_related: Involved in efficiently fetching rows by creating SQL joins related to the foreign key.\n4. RelatedPopulator.populate: Handles populating model instances when select_related is used; particularly affects how foreign key and relationships are loaded.\n5. QuerySet.only: Limits the fields fetched at a time when deferring others, directly linked to the given error.\n6. RelatedPopulator: Examines klass_info and is key for creating proxy occurrences that the error involved.\n7. SQLCompiler: Facilitates SQL query compilation that brings the models together.\n8. SQLCompiler.get_related_selections: Prepares for the select_related process by selecting columns and assembling methods critical for population.\n9. Query: Central class for managing SQL queries within Django.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Patch Explanation\n#### Modified Hunks\n- Added logic regarding the retrieval of `opts` by updating `cur_model._meta` to `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`.\n\n#### Hunk Explanation for the Before and After Codes\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1: Lines around 2575 - 2603 in `query.py`**:\n   - The patch modifies the lines where `klass_info`, `select_fields`, `init_list`, and additional related populator definitions occur. \n   - The update alters how metadata is fetched, focusing on concrete models (`cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta`) rather than direct metadata (`cur_model._meta`). The check regarding fields across proxy boundaries is expressly handled ensuring that underlying primary fields, involved with classic base rather than proxied model non-existent explicit fields, are fetched suitably.\n2. **Hunk 2: Adjustment ensures**:\n   - It changes variable initialization and features removing and overriding `pk_idx = self.init_list.index(self.model_cls._meta.pk.attname)`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correctness Check\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe modification is in the appropriate file `django/db/models/query.py` where most of Django\u2019s QuerySet logic is handled, and ensuring metadata structure fits for the fields selection on proxy model specific vulnerabilities and targetted result population.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues ----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n<new_issues_exp>\n1. The altered patch reschedules the streamlining populators yet re-attaches initializing sequences involving concrete interstitial models through optimization of primary vectors. \n2. The modified function overextends field pieces, restoring `pk_idx`, affecting sequence populators without complete underlying meta fortitude\u2014leads to multiple high redundancies.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Analysis\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch optimally tackles the malfunction distinguishing `._meta` to `.concrete_model._meta`, realign proxy breakdown cases. However, it introduces excess handling redundancies falsifying primed setups elevating runtime indirect complexities\u2014affirming common floors explored relay additional proxy-bound instance intermittence necessary correct edges overlooked lino-parts consolidation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
