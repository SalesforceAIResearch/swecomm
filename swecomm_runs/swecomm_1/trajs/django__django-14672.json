Specifically, it updates how `through_fields` is stored in the tuple being returned. Instead of directly using `self.through_fields`, it calls `make_hashable(self.through_fields)`. This change ensures that `through_fields` is hashable, thus preventing the `TypeError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting the correct function\u2014namely the `identity` property of `ManyToManyRel`.

The solution calls the `make_hashable` function on `through_fields`, analogous to the existing implementation for `limit_choices_to`. It does not introduce repetitive code, use incorrect APIs, or overlook edge cases. Therefore, the patch effectively fixes the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
