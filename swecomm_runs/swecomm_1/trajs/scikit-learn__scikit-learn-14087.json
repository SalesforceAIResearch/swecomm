It also maintains array manipulations and credited descriptions for different handling cases, but introduces repetitive comments without actual code logic improvements or fixes for the index error.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The candidate patch primarily adds comments describing the possible shapes of `coefs_paths` arrays at various locations.
