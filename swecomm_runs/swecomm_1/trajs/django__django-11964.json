This approach is sound and addresses the root cause of the mismatch observed between the expected and actual outputs. \nEvaluated against common LLM errors:\n1. **Repetitive code**: There is no repetitive logic present; the change is clean and singular.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The overridden `__str__` method is consistent with correct usage patterns in Python enums.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: All basics appear to be covered, and the intended behavior is accounted for, directly aligning it with captured requirements.\n\nTherefore, the patch should adequately resolve the issue of mismatched enum output, ensuring consistency for created and retrieved model instances.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Evaluating if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nTo determine if common LLM mistakes apply:\n- Repetitive code: The patch doesn't introduce repetition, it merely adds a `__str__` method.\n- Incorrect API usage: Using `str(self.value)` fits well within standard practices for defining `__str__` behavior in an enum member, particularly here.\n- Overlooking edge cases: While processing enum types directly, ensuring the `__str__` correctly returns string values is straightforward hence less prone to unexplored edge cases in this direct conversion.\n\nThe patch correctly adjusts the `__str__` method output for `TextChoices` and indirectly similar enum implementations mitigating confusing scenarios related to created models and validation tests.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7.

The new `__str__` method returns the underlying value of the enum instance by converting the `self.value` property to a string.\n\n#### Before patch:\n```python\nclass Choices(enum.Enum, metaclass=ChoicesMeta):\n    \"\"\"Class for creating enumerated choices.\"\"\"\n    pass\n```\n\n#### After patch:\n```python\nclass Choices(enum.Enum, metaclass=ChoicesMeta):\n    \"\"\"Class for creating enumerated choices.\"\"\"\n  \n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.value)\n      \n    pass\n```\nThis ensures an enum injected into a CharField or IntegerField will yield its instantiation value (string/int) form correctly when `str()` function is invoked.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `__str__()` method within the `Choices` class which is utilized by `TextChoices` and `IntegerChoices`. By ensuring the proper value renders through `__str__`, it correctly addresses improper type handling for enums attached to CharField or IntegerField.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues; rather, it aims to address a specific problem leveraging the defined structure. Valid uses align well \u2013 specifically in `CharField`, `Field`, and respective conversion methods especially `to_python`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue by changing how `Choices` and its subclasses (`TextChoices`, `IntegerChoices`) present themselves when converted to string using `__str__`. However, there may be an overlooked edge case in other field types carrying choices that can benefit from similar conversion handling. Nevertheless:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: There's none observed.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Correct use of Python's `__str__`.\n3. **Overlooking Edge cases**: Proper conversion to basic types covered, few overlooked across broader field applicability.\nThe fix targets the root by solving enum referenced like actual field values, thus dynamically corrects dealing disparity.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using Django models with IntegerChoices or TextChoices, the string representation of an enum value does not match the actual value stored. Specifically, when a model field created with IntegerChoices or TextChoices stores a value, retrieving this value via the model does not return the plain enum value as expected, but the full enum `name`. This behavior causes assertion errors in the provided test case because `str(field_value) != enum_value`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span IDs: Model.__init__, TextChoices, ChoicesMeta, CharField.get_prep_value, CharField.__init__, CharField, CharField.to_python, Field.get_prep_value, Field.to_python, Field\n- ChoicesMeta (`django/db/models/enums.py`): Metaclass for choices.\n- TextChoices (`django/db/models/enums.py`): Class for creating enumerated string choices.\n- Model.__init__ (`django/db/models/base.py`): Constructor for Django's Model class, handles field assignment from arguments, which is relevant as it relates to setting enum values into model instances.\n- Field, Field.get_prep_value, Field.to_python (`django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`): Base Field class and its methods involved in processing and validating field values.\n- CharField, CharField.get_prep_value, CharField.to_python, CharField.__init__ (`django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`): Specific Field subclass for character fields which shows how values assigned to CharField in models are processed and string conversion handled.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk: (django/db/models/enums.py LL61-65)\n  - Original code defines the `Choices` class derived from `enum.Enum` and sets up a metaclass `ChoicesMeta`. \n  - The patch introduces a `__str__` method to convert the choice value to string.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct location, as the issue relates to the string representation of choice values defined via the `Choices` class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is not introducing any solicitous issues and appears harmonious with the provided code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue by overriding the `__str__` method in the `Choices` class to return `self.value`. Additionally, this patch does not display any noted shortcomings:\n1. Repetitive code \u2013 The semantic address correctly links the core functionality of changing what is inherently singular across respective references.\n2. Incorrect API usage \u2013 Clean, precise adjustment: creating/altering the suitable function within correct scope.\n3. Overlooking edge cases \u2013 Retains the logical flow accurately steering field data when string conversion comes into effect solving assertion difference issue.\nThus, the robust creation liberates usage concerns reflecting values appropriately.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This means whenever the string-based enum value is accessed, it will directly return the correspondent string instead of an 'Enum value' wrapper.\n\nHunk Content:\n```python\nclass Choices(enum.Enum, metaclass=ChoicesMeta):\n    \"\"\"Class for creating enumerated choices.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __str__(self):\n        return str(self.value)\n\n    pass\n```\nBy adding the `__str__` method, it intends to ensure the string representation aligns with requirements in the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function since the `__str__` method within `Choices` directly impacts how the enum's values are represented as strings. This targets the exact problem where invoking __str__ on enumeration doesn't return the underlying value.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues. By modifying the `__str__` method of Choices to return `str(self.value)`, it leverages the already established pattern of accessing `value`, hence maintaining consistency. Moreover, it does not seem to contradict any of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch generally looks promising but still needs to be scrutinized for specific concerns:\n\n1. **Repetitive Code**: No repetitive code detected across the identified segments.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Using the `__str__()` method in the `Choices` class to return `str(self.value)` correctly leverages the existing API elements.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: No explicitly identified edge cases are overlooked but it should ensure that possibly all types extending Choices would reflect proper values (`String`, `Integer` types if broadened checks implemented might depend on this patch).\n\nConclusively, on careful review to avoid categorization mistakes, modified `__str__()` method targets fixing stated unexpected behavior, likely leading to issue convergence/assertion positively passing.\n\nThe fix addresses the primary concern stated in the issue, regarding consistent retrieval of texts by overriding the conversion flow using internally.\n\nHowever, possibility emerged edge cases not exhaustively tested.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
