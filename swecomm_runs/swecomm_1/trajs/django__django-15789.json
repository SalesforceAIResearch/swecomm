                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about adding an `encoder` parameter to the `django.utils.html.json_script()` function in Django. This change would allow users to customize the JSON encoding of values being output to the template layer. As it stands, the function uses a hardcoded encoder (`DjangoJSONEncoder`), which limits flexibility for custom encoding logic.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. json_script\n\nExplanation:\n- The function `json_script` in the `django.utils.html` module is relevant to the issue. This is the function that currently uses the hardcoded `DjangoJSONEncoder` and lacks a parameterized option for specifying a custom encoder. This is the function that needs modification to address the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Original code defining `json_script`:\n```\n62: def json_script(value, element_id=None):\n68:     from django.core.serializers.json import DjangoJSONEncoder\n70:     json_str = json.dumps(value, cls=DjangoJSONEncoder).translate(_json_script_escapes)\n71:     if element_id:\n72:         template = '<script id=\"{}\" type=\"application/json\">{}</script>'\n73:         args = (element_id, mark_safe(json_str))\n75:         template = '<script type=\"application/json\">{}</script>'\n76:         args = (mark_safe(json_str),)\n```\n\n2. Modified code with the `encoder` parameter:\n```\n62: def json_script(value, element_id=None, encoder=None):\n70:     if encoder is None:\n71:         encoder = DjangoJSONEncoder\n73:     json_str = json.dumps(value, cls=encoder).translate(_json_script_escapes)\n74:     if element_id:\n75:         template = '<script id=\"{}\" type=\"application/json\">{}</script>'\n76:         args = (element_id, mark_safe(json_str))\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- The first hunk lists the original `json_script` function which takes `value` and `element_id` parameters.\n- The patched code introduces an additional `encoder` parameter to the `json_script` function, with a default value of `None`.\n- Inside the function, it checks if `encoder` is `None` and if so, assigns `DjangoJSONEncoder` to it.\n- The JSON encoding part (`json.dumps(value, cls=encoder)`) now dynamically uses the provided encoder class or falls back to the default `DjangoJSONEncoder`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is updating the `json_script` function's definition and usage of the JSON encoder appropriately. This is precisely where the change was necessary to introduce the custom encoder parameter.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce any new issues. However, it assumes that the encoder class always has the same interface as `DjangoJSONEncoder` and doesn't add documentation for the new parameter in `json_script`. Additionally, marking the encoder as `None` initially and handling it within the function ensures backward compatibility.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by adding a customizable encoder option to the `json_script` function. Here's an analysis against common LLM mistakes:\n\n1. Repetitive Code: There is no repetitive code introduced by this patch.\n2. Incorrect API Usage: The patch correctly implements the JSON encoder assignment.\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: There's a potential edge case where the provided encoder might not conform to the `DjangoJSONEncoder` interface, leading to unexpected errors.\n\nOverall, the patch is almost correct and does not share extensive flaws. Adding detailed documentation is advisable to prevent misunderstanding of the usage of the new `encoder` parameter.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Its purpose is to escape special characters and wrap the JSON output in a script tag. The function currently uses `DjangoJSONEncoder` for JSON encoding, and this needs to be replaced or supplemented with a user-supplied encoder.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Modifying the definition of `json_script` function to include the `encoder` parameter.\n  - Tweaking the encoding logic to use the user-provided encoder if given, otherwise default to `DjangoJSONEncoder`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The first modification adds a new parameter `encoder` to the function definition of `json_script`:\n\n```python\ndef json_script(value, element_id=None, encoder=None):\n```\n\n- The next part introduces an if-condition to set the default encoder to `DjangoJSONEncoder` if no encoder is provided:\n\n```python\nif encoder is None:\n    encoder = DjangoJSONEncoder\njson_str = json.dumps(value, cls=encoder).translate(_json_script_escapes)\n```\n\nThese changes allow the function to accept an optional custom encoder while maintaining current behavior with `DjangoJSONEncoder` when no custom encoder is provided.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function.

Each modification in the candidate patch is relevant and necessary for allowing a custom encoder while retaining original functionality when an encoder is not provided.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses adding a custom encoder parameter to the `json_script` function:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: No repetitive code is observed in the patch.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: The usage of `json.dumps` with the custom `encoder` parameter seems accurate.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The patch gracefully defaults to `DjangoJSONEncoder` when no `encoder` is provided, thus maintaining the original function behavior and covering for the edge case when an encoder is not explicitly specified.\n\nAll points imply the patch effectively resolves the issue as mentioned without introducing any typical mistakes associated with LLM outputs.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n**Score**\n\n<score>10</score>"
