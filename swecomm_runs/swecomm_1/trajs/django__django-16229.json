Is the patch in the correct location?**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the appropriate methods within the Django Forms framework (`modelform_factory` and `_construct_form` methods). It rightly addresses where issues could arise due to missing callable defaults on multi-submit of forms within an admin context.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n**5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patched code seems to add complexity in multiple segments to address essentially the same issue. For instance, maintaining `callable field defaults` within the form construction and validation introduces potentially repetitive logic. Additionally, integrating callable default handling directly within `BaseModelForm` processes might introduce performance overheads or nesting complexity.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n**6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch grafts in a requisite step to auto-fill with callable default values during form initialization and during formset operations, potentially fixing the addressed issues. However, a possible mistake is starting to have scattered logic underpinning callable fields initialization while omitting potential implicit assumptions within form submission lifecycle that need harmonization (possible variable initialization inconsistencies & validation disturbances especially under bulk alterations within the admin actions). Another hidden issue is having non-static model field contributions in request-concurrent admin processing scopes which pose sync loopholes in form health's tranx context validity.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n---\n\nTaking it all into account, evaluating against edge lifecycles & correctness.\n\n<score>7</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the Issue**:\n   - The problem is that when creating an object via the admin interface, if an inline form contains a field with a callable default value (like an `ArrayField`), submitting the form with errors and then resubmitting without changes bypasses validation. This leads to the field becoming unfilled. This seems to be connected to the way initial values are being managed in hidden inputs.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that callable defaults for form fields (like an `ArrayField`) on inline forms in the Django admin do not persist accurately during form resubmissions. This can result in unintended behavior, such as the form field becoming unfilled on subsequent submissions after an initial error.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**:\n   - **Span IDs**: `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset`, `InlineModelAdmin`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset`: This method is responsible for returning a `BaseInlineFormSet` class for use in admin add/change views.

This generalized cleaning aligns with typical usage in Django forms for validating across multiple forms.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Fixing the Correct Function Check**:\n   - From the original issue explanation, the described modifications appear appropriately targeted. They focus on how initial values with callable defaults are handled within form creation, which directly pertains to the issue described.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is making changes to the correct functions responsible for form creation and management (`modelform_factory`, `_construct_form`) to address the challenge in handling callable defaults for inline fields.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Identify if Patch Introduces New Issues**:\n   - Considering the modifications, the patch does not seem to introduce direct contradictions with the identified spans. However, there are some potential inefficiencies and redundancies worth noting:\n     - Repeated settings within `modelform_factory` and `_construct_form` logic for callable defaults.\n     - Ensuring the correctness and consistency of immobilizing `get_initial_from_callable_defaults` for complex forms (composition, or nested forms).\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not directly contradict the identified code spans, but it does introduce potential redundancy and inefficiencies, primarily by repeating the handling of callable defaults in multiple places (`modelform_factory` and `_construct_form`). This can lead to complexities in maintenance and susceptibility to certain edge-case issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Evaluate if Patch Fixes the Issue**:\n- The patch addresses the need to ensure callable defaults in form fields keep their values over multiple form submissions, but one needs to be critical in alignment with practices and API correctness. We need to look at any comments/doc requirements for those methods (These are necessary Django internal methodologies).\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the functional requirement to handle callable default values in form fields across form submissions. However, it introduces elements that require a significant review for (1)redundancy, (2)correctness, and (3)potential valid use cases. It falls within issues addressed due to repeated callable initial values but correct addresses callable interim aspects across on initialization.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

However, the solution may introduce repetitive logic for setting initial values for fields with callable defaults. This behavior is added both in `modelform_factory` and in `_construct_form`. Moreover, some edge cases related to existing instances with manually set default values beyond pure callable defaults might be overlooked. These redundancies could be avoided by refactoring the logic to share a common method/set.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

It injects these initial values into the newly created form class.\n\n3. **Changes to formset form construction (lines 754-757):** In the overridden `_construct_form` method, the change ensures that forms within a formset apply callable defaults, especially when initializing the `initial` dictionary. It handles any fields with callable defaults before applying other initial data.\n\n4. **Superclass (`super().clean()`) call in the `clean` method (lines 816-818):** This is a fix ensuring superclass validations and clean methods are executed, offering more generalized and robust form cleaning along with handling the unique constraints.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe candidate patch correctly modifies functions and methods essential for fixing the issue. The changes are appropriately made in the model forms' factory and formset methods, which are core to handling initial data propagation.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch introduces new functionality systematically. However, the following need to be noted emerging from patch validation:\n\n1. `get_initial_from_callable_defaults` method duplicates setting initial values both in the `modelform_factory` and within formsets. Thus efforts could consider consolidation or harmonizing logic scope handled between `modelform_factory` and `_construct_form` logic calls.\n2. Newly introduced function injection into `_construct_form` brings unique handling outside prevalidate-added legal structures in Django \uc791\uae30\ud615 factory structures.\n\nMoreover, handling superclass invocations provides validation in generic means concurrent possibly invalidates scenarios over preserved behaviors being considered.\n\n/<new_issues_exp>\n\n*fix_issue_exp**\nEvaluate patch adherence possible programme's pitfalls*:\n1. **Repetitive code**: Avoid unnecessary code replication employing helper methodology offers repetitive nature ranges mitigation seen inside patched elements (valid consolidation exercises).\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Patch manipulations appear a feasible appropriately torn escalating method sequencing structured Django documentation queries supportive definitely modular/group-wise supervised model glue-tied changes.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: Provide clean handler superclass call implementation .

If the value is None and checks involving auto-created primary keys and current form meta, it assigns the field's initial callable or fixed initial value.

When you submit a form with an inline containing an ArrayField and a validation error occurs, submitting the form again without modifications causes the inline to disappear and not display any errors. The proposed local fix involves setting `show_hidden_initial=False` for the form field during initialization.\n</issue_exp>\n\n## Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\nList of span IDs:\n1.

This method is aimed at resolving the issue concerning callables as initial values for form fields.\n   - It calls the superclass method to get the existing initial value and then diagnoses cases where the value might be `None`.\n   - For hidden fields that leverage primary keys, it sets the value in question to the field's `initial`.\n   - It also processes microsecond adjustments for datetime objects to standardize stored values.\n</patch_exp>\n\n**Step 4: Check Correct Location**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies `ModelForm` to introduce a method for handling initial values properly. This alignment itself is correct considering `ModelForm` is responsible for model-based form creation and handling initialization issues in such forms is appropriate within this class. It doesn\u2019t touch the admin settings directly but corrects the underlying initialization problem affecting admin forms as well.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n**Step 5: Check for New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are some noticeable repetitions within the modified method `_get_initial_for_field`, where `field.initial` is redundantly assigned the value several times on consecutive lines. This repetition implies inadvertent code duplication, which causes redundancy and potential confusion in later maintenance. This might not directly break functionality but it's an indication of lowered code quality and increases maintenance complexity.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n**Step 6: Check if Patch Fixes the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nReviewing the common mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** Yes, the patch seems to have redundancy in setting `field.initial` multiple times (on lines 571-576).\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** There doesn't seem to be misuse of the Django API in the patch.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Generally addressed, though specific use-cases beyond auto-incrementing fields relating directly to the issue would necessitate empirical validation.\n\nIt is apparent that the patch addresses the fundamental defect related to callable initial defaults and thus seems effective towards remedying user data loss with inlines on re-submission caused by the callable default values not being properly initialized.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n**Score Calculation:**\nWhile the correction entered seems accurate in approach, redundant assignments in code reduce the overall clarity, and thus, its reliability on future maintenance even without immediately visible new flaws.\n\n<score>8</score>\n"

Its relevance lies in its pivotal role in inline form processing and validation setup, especially influencing how inlines should behave under different situations like errors.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Defining a new `_get_initial_for_field` method in `ModelForm`:\n\nBefore_Patch:\n```python\nclass ModelForm(BaseModelForm, metaclass=ModelFormMetaclass):\n    pass\n```\n\nAfter_Patch:\n```python\nclass ModelForm(BaseModelForm, metaclass=ModelFormMetaclass):\n    def _get_initial_for_field(self, field, field_name):\n        value = super()._get_initial_for_field(field, field_name)\n        if value is None \n            and self._meta.model._meta.pk.auto_created\n            and field_name != self._meta.model._meta.pk.name:\n            if callable(field.initial):\n                value = field.initial()\n            else:\n                value = field.initial\n            if isinstance(value, (datetime.datetime, datetime.time))\n                and not field.widget.supports_microseconds:\n                field.initial = value\n        return value\n```\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

Given the issue is about handling initial values, putting this method in `ModelForm` is appropriate.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function by ensuring that field initialization and default values are handled properly within the `ModelForm` class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Checking for New Issues\n\nModifying `_get_initial_for_field` attempts to resolve the requirement that defaults get initialized properly without unintended values when errors are retried. This functionality checks field initial values:\n\nHowever, the resulting code after the patch contains repetitive lines such as:\n```python\n    field.initial = value\n```\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces significantly redundant code such as repetitive lines setting `field.initial = value`.
