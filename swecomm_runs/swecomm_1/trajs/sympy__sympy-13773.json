MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__\n2. MatrixArithmetic.__rmatmul__\n3. MatrixArithmetic.__mul__\n4. MatrixExpr.__matmul__\n5. MatrixExpr.__rmatmul__\n\nExplanation:\n1. **MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__**:\n   - This is the method that currently performs matrix multiplication by calling `__mul__` on the `self` object with the `other` object. It is the method directly related to the issue since the bug is in allowing non-matrix types.\n\n2. **MatrixArithmetic.__rmatmul__**:\n   - This is the reversed matrix multiplication method that uses `__rmul__`. Similar to `__matmul__`, it should only be valid for matrix-to-matrix operations, and its current incorrect behavior could introduce bugs.\n\n3. **MatrixArithmetic.__mul__**:\n   - This method is invoked within `__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__`. It handles various multiplication scenarios including matrix-to-scalar multiplication, which shouldn't happen for the `@` (matrix multiplication) operator. The oversight of the earlier design seems to have allowed improper operator overloading.\n\n4. **MatrixExpr.__matmul__**:\n   - Similarly to `MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__`, this candidate span shows overloading `@` to use `MatMul`. It should also perform appropriate checks on types to prohibit invalid operations.\n\n5. **MatrixExpr.__rmatmul__**:\n   - Like `MatrixExpr.__matmul__`, this method performs reversed overloading for matrix multiplication, fitting into the boundary conditions for reversing args and checks.\n</code_span_explain>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n\n1. Hunk in `__matmul__` method of `MatrixArithmetic`:\n   - Added a check to see if the `other` operand is of `MatrixRequired` type (presumably, a required matrix type); if not, it raises a ValueError informing the user that scalar operands should use `*` instead. If the check passes, it proceeds with the multiplication.\n\n2. Hunk in `__rmatmul__` method of `MatrixArithmetic`:\n   - Similar to the previous hunk, adds a check for `MatrixRequired` type and raises an error for scalar operands, ensuring only valid matrix types proceed with reversed multiplication.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting the correct locations for addressing the error within the `__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__` methods, which are directly related to matrix multiplication via `@` operator overloads.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a new type alias or requires definition for `MatrixRequired`, leading to a lack of clarity whether it matches a valid type already defined elsewhere or not. Without this introduction context, the patch\u2019s integrity might jeopardize if the required type isn\u2019t system-preset.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch looks targeted at preventing invalid scalar operands by identifying the operation input types, yet it suffers notable concerns:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: Checking and raising identical errors twice lacks optimal code reuse principles.\n2. **Introduces new risks** if `MatrixRequired` is undefined or faulty compatible.\n\nIf corrected and the guts are correctly in system predef-dependent variables/extensions, it might enclose incorrectly used repetitive Operator Overloading in missed vigilance defensible design scope.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n<score>\n-1\n</score>"

The expected behavior is akin to NumPy, where using a scalar with `@` results in a `ValueError`, enforcing that operands must be matrices.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Identified Code Spans Explanation\n\n**List of Span Ids:** \n1. MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__\n2. MatrixArithmetic.__rmatmul__\n3. MatrixArithmetic.__mul__\n4. MatrixExpr.__matmul__\n5. MatrixExpr.__rmatmul__\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1.

Modification to `__matmul__` in `sympy/matrices/common.py`\n2. Modification to `__rmatmul__` in `sympy/matrices/common.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modification to `__matmul__` in `sympy/matrices/common.py`:\n    * Added a type-check that raises a `ValueError` if the operand `other` isn't an instance of `MatrixRequired`, preventing scalar operands from being valid in matrix multiplication.\n\n2.

The changes ensure that the `__matmul__` method only allows matrix operands and does the same for the reverse matrix multiplication `__rmatmul__`, which adheres to the correct method needing adjustments as originally identified in the code spans.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issue Introduction Check\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch potentially introduces a new issue: the `MatrixRequired` type check. This identifier doesn't exist within the existing codebase or industry conventions.\n\nFurthermore, this added check might overlook the already defined and expected type of input (`Matrix`, `MatrixLike`, etc.) found in the relevant implementation of `__mul__`.\n\nAdditionally, `MatrixExpr` corresponding methods were not updated, which might lead to inconsistent behavior.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Check\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. Repetitive Code: The patch properly centralizes the specific logic for operand validation in correct places inside `__matmul__` and `__rmatmul__`.\n\n2. Incorrect API Usage: The apparent usage of `MatrixRequired` appears to be incorrect; it relies on a type or a convention not defined or known, and could lead to undefined variable errors.\n\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: The patch seems to overlook the appropriate import or redefinition of matrices in `__makeat__.py` span rather than seamlessly integrating necessary bitmap verification chcrcns.\n\nGiven the control structures present, a specific abstraction check as opposed to prior utility handling within multidimensional libraries, suspends perceived weight in identifying fixed micro issues and does warrant quick specific controller impedance.\n\nTherefore, the patch delivers substandard service in fixing unless rightly scaffold-independent expectations alongside compatibility breaking integrate patch fixes merely applicative here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>-1</score>"

Currently, it calls the corresponding reverse multiplication method `__rmul__`.\n   - **MatrixArithmetic.__mul__:** This method manages both scalar and matrix multiplication. Adjustments here are crucial to distinguish when a scalar multiplication is attempted.\n   - **MatrixExpr.__matmul__:** This function manages matrix multiplication for matrix expressions and calls `MatMul` to execute the operation.\n   - **MatrixExpr.__rmatmul__:** This function handles reverse matrix multiplication for matrix expressions and also calls `MatMul` to complete the operation.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\n   - **Modified Hunks:**\n\n     <patch_exp>\n     - **Hunk 1 (Common Methods):**\n       - **Before:** `@call_highest_priority('__rmatmul__')`, `def __matmul__(self, other):`, `...`\n       - **After:** Added check if `other` is an instance of `_MinimalMatrix`, raising error else.\n     - **Hunk 2 (common.py: 2014 onwards):**\n       - **Before:** Checking whether `other` is not iterable for scalar multiplication.\n       - **After:** Throws a TypeError explicitly if `other` is not iterable.\n     - **Hunk 3 (upper include and common.py: 9):**\n       - **New import of `collections.abc` and making sure collections.Iterable is correctly referenced everywhere to collections.abc.Iterable.\n     - **Hunk 4 (common.py: 2081):**\n       - **Repetitive checks for multiplcation purposes**\n\n     </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   The patch correctly addresses modifications within the `__matmul__` method. It also ensures that non-matrix types are rejected in accordance with the specified error behavior.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch introduces contradictions and redundant checks in the `__mul__` method (including `if not isinstance(other, collections.Iterable):`). The logic has multiple redundant new sanity checks and breaks the flow increasing complexity unneccessarily.\nRegarding the added comments might break type flow UX instead pushing misleading error messages around seriously counted.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch partially fixes the issue by adding type checks to prevent non-matrix objects from being used in matrix multiplication. However, it introduces redundancy and ineffective check re-usability for the already functional matching checks distorting the flow hence causing new rounded exceptions mishandling.\nWhile internal variable defined repetency would crash/blocks created flow logic.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Provide a Score:**\n\n<score>2</score>"
