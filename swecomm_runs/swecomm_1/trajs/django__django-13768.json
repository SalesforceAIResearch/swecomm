However, the implementation falls prey to repetitive code issues:\n1. The import statement and logger initialization are performed within the loop, which can be redundant and less optimal.\n2. The logger call uses `logger.error('Error in receiver %s', receiver)`, which, although functional, doesn't exploit the more descriptive `logger.exception()` that automatically includes traceback details.\n\nTherefore, while the fix addresses the issue, it has inefficiencies that could be resolved for a better implementation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>\n\nThe score reflects that while the patch correctly addresses the logging issue within the `send_robust` method, it introduces inefficient repetitiveness that needs optimization, thus losing a few points for those inefficiencies."

Signal.send_robust\n\nThe `Signal.send_robust` method is directly relevant to the issue. This method sends a signal to all connected receivers while catching and returning any exceptions raised by them. The segment in question needs to log these exceptions to aid in debugging, which the issue description addresses.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk 1:\n- **Added Import and Logger Initialization**:\n  - The following lines were added:\n  ```python\n  import logging\n  logger = logging.getLogger('django.dispatch')\n  ```\n\n2. Modified Hunk 2:\n- **Enhanced Exception Handling**:\n  - The line `responses.append((receiver, err))` was replaced with logging:\n  ```python\n  logger.exception('Error calling %s in Signal.send_robust()', receiver.__qualname__, exc_info=err)\n  responses.append((receiver, err))\n  ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `send_robust` method located within `dispatcher.py`, which is indeed the correct location to address the issue as described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo, the patch does not appear to introduce new issues. It adds logging while ensuring existing functionality remains unchanged.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. Repetitive code: There is no indication of repetitive code; the patch efficiently accomplishes its objective with minimal but effective changes.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The usage of `logger.exception` appears to be correct. `logger.exception` correctly uses `exc_info=err` for detailed traceback information.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: The patch does not address any new edge cases; however, for the specific logging requirement, it correctly handles all exceptions, which seems comprehensive enough for the context.\n\nThus, the patch appears to fix the described issue correctly without common mistakes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue describes the absence of logging in the Signal.send_robust() method when exceptions are raised by receivers. Typically, Django logs exceptions to aid in error handling, however, this seems to be missing in the current implementation of Signal.send_robust(). Consequently, exceptions in receivers are not visible in error monitoring tools like Sentry unless the user explicitly handles them with a try-except block.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nList of Span IDs:\n1. Signal.send_robust\n\nThe identified code span (\"Signal.send_robust\") encompasses the entire implementation of the send_robust method in dispatcher.py. This span is pivotal to the issue at hand, as it currently handles exception cases but does not log them. Any changes or additions to tackle the issue will revolve around this function, especially inside the exception handling block.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. b/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py start_line=1\n2. b/django/dispatch/dispatcher.py start_line=206\n\nHunk 1 explains:\nA logger is being initialized for the module using Python's logging library.
