The problem lies in the nested iterations where the row indices exceed the number of columns.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans:**\n\nList of span ids:\n- `DenseMatrix.__getitem__`\n- `MatrixProperties.is_upper`\n- `a2idx`\n- `MatrixBase.key2ij`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `DenseMatrix.__getitem__`: This span defines how matrix elements are accessed using indices or tuples. It gets triggered during element access which can raise an `IndexError`.\n- `MatrixProperties.is_upper`: This span contains the `is_upper` method which is identified as the primary location of the error logged due to incorrect index accesses.\n- `a2idx`: This function ensures that index values are valid and positive. It is relevant because it catches out-of-range indices and raises `IndexError`.\n- `MatrixBase.key2ij`: This utility method transforms keys into valid indices to be used for element access and is crucial for index validation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- `sympy/matrices/matrices.py` lines 1113-1115\n\n<patch_exp>\n- In the modified hunk from line 1113 to 1115, the logic for the nested iteration inside the `is_upper` property has been updated: the inner loop now iterates `for j in range(min(i, self.cols))` instead of `for j in range(i)`. This ensures that index `j` does not exceed the number of columns, avoiding the `IndexError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `is_upper` function, which is the correct function to address this issue because this function contained the existing problematic nested iteration logic accessing out-of-bound indices.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no new issues introduced by this patch. It correctly limits the range of the inner loop to ensure `j` does not exceed the column count, which aligns well with how indices are managed in the provided code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately addresses the issue by setting appropriate bounds for the inner loop in the nested iteration within the `is_upper` method. It thus avoids the problem of accessing out-of-bound column indices. The patch does not depict repetitive code or any incorrect API usage. Edge cases involving non-square matrices seem well-considered by capping the column iteration using `self.cols`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
