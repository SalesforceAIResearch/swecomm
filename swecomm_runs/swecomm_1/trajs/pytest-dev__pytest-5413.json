Original line did not define `__str__`: \n   New code adds:\n   ```python\n   def __str__(self):\n       if self.excinfo is not None:\n           return str(self.excinfo.value)\n       return \"\"\n   ```\n   This newly added method returns the string representation of the value of the wrapped exception if there's one captured, otherwise returns an empty string.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function.

Specifically, `str(e)` on a `pytest.raises` context manager returns `<console>:3: LookupError: A`, representing the raised LookupError minimally, whereas, using `str(e.value)` incorrectly outputs the exception's entire message (`A\\nB\\nC`). This mismatch in behavior is causing unwanted and inconsistent outcomes.\n    ```\n    <issue_exp>\n    The issue highlights that using `str()` on a captured exception context with `pytest.raises` does not mimic the behavior observed when catching exceptions using try-except. It limits the information on the line where the error was raised instead of outputting the full error message.

Its adjustment influences how exceptions\u2019 details are intended while accessed via `str`.\n     - **Relevance**: Considering the issue is regarding how the `str()` function outputs the exception details, this function emphasizes formatting exception information for `pyText` primarily.\n     \n    - **ExceptionInfo**: Class wraps exceptions, likely associated with the `RaisesContext`.\n     - **Relevance**: Being a fundamental class that captures and stores the exception details, any update relevant to the `RaisesContext` will concurrently affect class-based methods/tools that interact/reflect exception details.\n     \n    - **raises**: `pytest.raises` function catches exception and creates `RaisesContext`.\n     - **Relevance~~: Directly associated with setting up the `typeinfo` (where differences arose due to returned exception information).\n\n<!-- Encapsulation -->\n  ```\n  <code_span_exp>\n  {\n    \"exceptioninfo.__str__\": This deals with the string representation of the ExceptionInfo object.

The request is to modify this behavior to make it consistent and more intuitive, by ensuring `str()` on `pytest.raises` context variable outputs the full error message.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**\n\n*List of Span IDs*: `ExceptionInfo.__str__`, `ExceptionInfo`, `raises`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **ExceptionInfo.__str__**: This is a method within the `ExceptionInfo` class and provides the string representation of an exception information structure. Its behavior directly impacts issue since `RaisesContext` returns this type in the context manager.\n\n- **ExceptionInfo**: This class wraps `sys.exc_info()` objects and helps in navigating the traceback. Since `RaisesContext` returns an `ExceptionInfo` object, any changes related to `ExceptionInfo` could impact how exceptions are processed and displayed.\n\n- **raises**: This function is a core part of how pytest captures and asserts exceptions via the `RaisesContext` class. The function implementation contains the setup for capturing raised exceptions and impacts how users can interact with the context manager API.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n\n*List of Modified Hunks*:\n- Hun: \n  ```python\n  <after_patch>\n  <file:b/src/_pytest/python_api.py,start_line:708>\n  ```\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Change in `__enter__` method of `RaisesContext`**: Originally, it returned `self.excinfo` object. The patch updated it to return `self` instead, allowing string representation directly using `RaisesContext` without explicitly accessing `excinfo`.\n\n- **Addition of `__str__` method in `RaisesContext`**: Multiple `__str__` methods were added to handle the string representation logic, ensuring calling `str` directly on the context returns the complete error message.\n  Content Repetitive alerts identified because of duplicated methods implementation inside `RaisesContext`.\n\n- **Addition of `get_full_message` method in `RaisesContext`**: It provides a full error message by returning `str(self.excinfo.value)` if available, otherwise an empty string.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch seems to be addressing the correct function. Changes are within the `RaisesContext` class which is directly utilized by the `raises` function to manage exception contexts.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces redundant code:\n- It adds multiple `__str__` methods in `RaisesContext`, which is not standard Python practice and may cause undefined behavior.\n- The provided implementation introduces unnecessary duplication and adds clutter within `RaisesContext`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aims to allow the `str()` function to handle a `RaisesContext` object directly, changing its behavior for consistency. However, the execution suffers from common LLM mistakes:\n- **Repetitive Code**: Multiple `__str__` method definitions introduce redundancy.\n- **Missing Edge Cases**: Evaluation of edge cases like null and unassigned `excinfo` could result in inconsistent behavior not fully addressed after the patch.\nIt's clear that the patch tackles the problem scope but inappropriately embeds redundant logic which should be cleaned for effective impact.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>2</score>"

However, it's repeated twice without any visible variation.\n</hunk_1_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch attempts to fix the discrepancy in the `RaisesContext` class by modifying the `__str__` method to call `str(self.excinfo.value)` from the context object, which aligns with where the change is needed. Therefore, it addresses the correct function and location to resolve the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is introducing a substantial issue with repetitive code. It redefines methods `__str__`, `__init__`, and `__enter__` twice within the sting content. This redundancy could lead to erroneous behavior, confusion in the codebase, and versioning issues that are hard to debug.\n\nAdditionally, having `get_full_message`, which basically duplicates what `__str__` was intended to solve, points to shortcomings in the patch design.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aims to fix the issue effectively as per the logic changes introduced, especially this change in the `RaisesContext.__str__` method. \nHowever:\n1. There is a significant quantity of repetitive code disrupting which impairs the function\n2. New mixed approaches, if included logically, are contradictory such as redundant methods\n\nThus, while the patch takes some steps in the right direction, it requires refactoring to be not considered both redundant and pragmatically error-prone.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>4</score>"

RaisesContext.__enter__ method:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The return value has been modified from `self.excinfo` to `self`, so that the `RaisesContext` object is returned directly.\n\n2. Adds `__str__` method inside `RaisesContext`:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Implements a `__str__` method to return the string representation of `self.excinfo.value` if `self.excinfo` is not `None`, else returns an empty string.\n\n3. Duplicate methods like __str__: \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Duplicate `__str__` method definitions found (lines 730-738, 764-767), intended to return string representations.\n\n4.

                    "msg": "1. **Understanding the Issue**\n   ```issue_exp\n   The issue encountered deals with the `pytest.raises` context manager. When an exception is raised within this context, calling `str()` on the captured exception does not provide the complete error message like it does when normally caught exceptions are converted to string. Instead, it returns a shorter string. This different behavior can be confusing and lead to potential issues.\n   ```issue_exp\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n   - Span IDs:\n     1. ExceptionInfo.__str__\n     2. ExceptionInfo\n     3. raises\n\n   ```code_span_exp\n   - ExceptionInfo.__str__: This span contains the `__str__` method implementation for the `ExceptionInfo` class, crucial because it defines how the exception information is represented as a string.\n     \n   - ExceptionInfo: This span defines the `ExceptionInfo` class which is used to wrap around exceptions raised by `pytest.raises`, hence any modifications in string representation would likely need adjustments here.\n     \n   - raises: This span is the function of the pytest API that deals with exception handling context. The issue centers around this function's handling of exceptions and how they are represented when using `str()`.\n   ```code_span_exp\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n   - The modified hunk:\n   \n     ```patch_exp\n     - The hunk modifies the `__str__` method of the `ExceptionInfo` class.\n     \n     - Before Patch:\n       ```python\n       def __str__(self):\n           if self._excinfo is None:\n               return repr(self)\n           entry = self.traceback[-1]\n           loc = ReprFileLocation(entry.path, entry.lineno + 1, self.exconly())\n           return str(loc)\n       ```\n\n     - After Patch:\n       ```python\n       def __str__(self):\n           return repr(self)\n       ```\n\n     - Explanation:\n       The hunk simplifies the `__str__` method to always return `repr(self)` regardless of whether `_excinfo` is `None` or what is contained within `_traceback`. This would override the current mechanism which adapted the string representation based on exception information.\n     ```patch_exp\n     \n\n4. **Verifying Correct Location**\n   ```correct_location_exp\n   Yes, the patch is modifying the correct location. The changes are being applied to the `__str__` method within the `ExceptionInfo` class, which is directly responsible for the string representation of exceptions raised by `pytest.raises`.\n   ```correct_location_exp\n\n\n5. **Checking for New Issues**\n   ```new_issues_exp\n   The patch is introducing a new issue: it doesn't distinguish between scenarios where `_excinfo` is `None` or contains valid exception information. As a result, it replaces meaningful, informative tracebacks with the less informative `repr(self)`. This will hinder debugging efforts and reduce context awareness for end-users.\n   ```new_issues_exp\n\n6. **Evaluating if the Patch Fixes the Issue**\n   ```fix_issue_exp\n   The original problem is that `str()` on the `pytest.raises` `ExceptionInfo` context variable had a different, less useful behavior compared to the generic exception handling string conversion. Altering the `__str__` method to always return `repr(self)` homogenizes the outputs, thus addressing the variability issue. However, it also means losing potentially useful detailed information. Additionally, it doesn't fall strictly under the common mistake of repetitive code or incorrect API usage; however, it inadequately handles edge cases and important details that can render `ExceptionInfo` nearly ineffective for debugging.\n   ```fix_issue_exp\n\n<score>5</score>"
