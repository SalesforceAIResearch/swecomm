Still, it re-raises `ConnectionError` rather generally which may improperly wrap other derived exceptions or analogous socket elements from different network libraries, potentially overshadowing another existing specific error processing.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive code**: No significant repetitive code was identified.\n- **Incorrect API usage**: The patch correctly intercepts `socket.errors` exceptions in relevant places.\n- **Overlooking edge cases**: The patch wraps all socket errors into `ConnectionError` without kindly note heterogeneity in original design spotting further finer error combination to segregate better than mere owing it to wrapped monolithically as a `ConnectionError`.\n\nOverall, the LLM does consider the issue, primarily decent but uncategorical interception episodically augmenting could miss catching intricacies in distinctions.

The changes in `RequestException.__init__` ensure that any exceptions, including `socket.error`, that occur during the handling of the request are trapped and properly wrapped in `ConnectionError`. Additionally, the try-except block wrapped around the `adapter.send(request, **kwargs)` call in the `send` function is correctly addressing socket-level errors while performing the actual sending of the request.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict with any of the identified code spans. However, the implementation in `RequestException.__init__` conflicts with standard error handling because socket errors should ideally be caught at the lower levels where the socket operations actually happen, rather than at the initialization of a generic request exception which might involve non-socket-related issues as well.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. Repetitive Code: The patch seems to focus only in the `send` method; it does not introduce repeated code inappropriately.\n2. Incorrect API usage: There are no indications of incorrect API usage. The import of the `socket` module and the raising of `ConnectionError` are correct usages.\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: The patch does appropriately handle the basic edge case described in the issue, where it wraps the `socket.error` within `ConnectionError`.\n\nHowever, the changes in `RequestException.__init__` may inadvertently catch socket errors too broadly and in areas where other, possibly unrelated operations might be affected. Therefore, it introduces a potential issue where non-socket-related `RequestException` might misreport its cause. Additionally, subtle edge cases like different socket error types across various parts of the library need proper handling at the source (e.g., in `urllib3`).\n\nThe overall approach is not holistic enough. Proper handling at each critical layer where sockets are used should be considered to avoid overgeneralization.\n\nThese factors pull down the usefulness of the fix.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

When a socket error, such as a socket reset, occurs while using the `requests` library, it manifests as a raw `socket.error` instead of being caught and raised as a more appropriate `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. The user expects socket-related exceptions to be wrapped in `requests` module exceptions to handle them in a consistent manner.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans:\n- List of the span ids: HTTPAdapter.send, ConnectionError, VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect, HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen, ProtocolError, impl\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. HTTPAdapter.send: This code span in `adapters.py` shows the function responsible for sending the HTTP request and where exceptions like `socket.error` and custom exceptions like `ConnectionError` are raised. It's crucial to replicate socket error handling within `requests`.\n2. ConnectionError: This code defines the custom exception that signifies a connection error in `requests`. It serves as the target exception for socket-related errors.\n3. VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect: This method in `connection.py` is relevant because it wraps sockets using SSL and can encounter `socket.error`, showing how such exceptions can propagate back to the user.\n4. HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen: This method in `connectionpool.py` handles lower-level connection pooling and HTTP request execution, also responsible for catching and transforming `socket` exceptions to higher-level exceptions.\n5. ProtocolError: Indicates part of the exception hierarchy, present in `exceptions.py`. Helpful to understand overall exception handling.\n6. impl: This points to line linking `ConnectionError` to `ProtocolError`, providing insights into hierarchy and where exceptions can be managed cohesively\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

The expectation is that such errors should be wrapped and raised as a `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`, providing a more consistent API for error handling when making HTTP requests using the `requests` library.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span IDs: [HTTPAdapter.send, ConnectionError, VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect, HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen, ProtocolError, impl]\n  \n1. `HTTPAdapter.send`: This function is responsible for sending HTTP requests. It likely already intercepts some known exceptions and raises corresponding `requests` exceptions, making it relevant for extending the handling to `socket.error`.\n\n2. `ConnectionError`: This class represents a connection error in `requests`. The fix might include changes to ensure that `socket.error` gets wrapped into this type.\n\n3. `VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect`: This helps in managing managed HTTPS connections, important for reinforcing or changing how connection errors, including `socket.error`, manifest back up the chain.\n\n4. `HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen`: This is the low-level API for making HTTP requests, directly interfacing with the connection pools, similar to the situation in the flagged line. Crucial for managing custom exception integration such as `socket.error`.\n\n5. `ProtocolError`: Used as a generalized base class for unintentionally ending request/response cycles. Understanding this could impact how you extend or wrap particular socket error behavior.\n\n6. `impl`: Maps errors specific to `urllib3`, crucial for aligning repeated definitions or specialized mappings like `ConnectionError`.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Modified hunks:\n  1. The patch introduces an import statement for `socket` in `models.py` to handle `socket.error`.\n  2. A new exception handling block is added for `socket.error` in the chunked-reading code, where multiple identical blocks retry raising a `ConnectionError`.\n\n**Details:**\n1. **Import Statement Modification:**\n   - Marks the inclusion of importing the `socket` library, essential to handle `socket.error`.\n\n2. **Chunk Handling Change:**\n   - Re-injects a new multiple catching pattern for `socket.error`, attempted by infusing snippets like `except socket.error as e` that should remap it towards `raise ConnectionError(e)`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch targets the correct location by modifying the management segment for reading chunked responses where the provided stack trace observed an unrewrapped `socket.error`. Additionally, including the socket import aligns appropriately to assist immediate exception retargeting appropriately.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch presents redundant catch rules (`socket.error` repeats five times). This gets aggravated by seemingly mislaid line handling for multiple repeating captures transforming a clear once-time coverage into mutable raising noise. Code redundancy could manifest performance and maintenance concerns without clear enhancement.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch inadequately resolves problem aspects by dangerously assuming import redeclaration or reach-spanning multiple catch ambiguity lines as socket.error boxes manipulated beyond singular reckoning. \n\nExamining prevalent LLM common pattern fallibilities such as repetitive dysfunction primarily answers prevailing overlap whilst negligibly appending angle fallouts eschewing minimal redundancy, repetitions and segmentation balance tackling accurately the underlying focus problems.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>\n"
