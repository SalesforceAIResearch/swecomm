Currently, the `__isnull` lookup allows non-boolean values, which can cause confusion since it only makes sense for `__isnull` to operate with boolean values (`True` or `False`). The goal is to modify the code to raise an error when non-boolean values are used with the `__isnull` lookup.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about preventing the use of the `__isnull` lookup in Django with non-boolean values. The aim is to raise an error if a non-boolean value is used to avoid confusion since `__isnull` logically should only work with boolean values.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n#### List of Span IDs\nThe span IDs provided are:\n- `IsNull`\n- `IsNull.as_sql`\n- `Query.build_filter`\n\n#### Explanation of Code Spans\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `IsNull`: Defines the `IsNull` class, which is a lookup involving a NULL check in the database.\n2. `IsNull.as_sql`: Method within the `IsNull` class which compiles SQL for this lookup.

This fix avoids incorrect usage of non-boolean values within the mentioned lookup. However, there is some degree of repetitive logic as similar validation checks are placed in multiple locations (constructor, methods such as `get_prep_lookup`, `process_rhs`, and `as_sql`). Consolidating these checks where possible might enhance maintainability. Despite the repetition, as these checks ensure robustness, they help resolve the issue comprehensively. Therefore:\n\n1. **Repetitive code:** The patch has repetitive checks across different methods which might be redundant.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** The API usage is correct and follows documentation errors.\n3. **Edge cases:** The patch addresses edge cases efficiently ensuring `rhs` is validated as boolean consistently.\n\nThese points make the patch effective in addressing the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

To address this, the code needs to raise an error if a non-boolean value is used with the `__isnull` lookup.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n**List of span IDs:**\n- IsNull\n- IsNull.as_sql\n- Query.build_filter\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **IsNull:** This span defines the `IsNull` class which is registered as a lookup with the name 'isnull'. This is central to the issue as it is the specific lookup that needs to enforce the requirement of a boolean RHS value.\n- **IsNull.as_sql:** This method within the `IsNull` class forms the SQL expression for the 'isnull' lookup. Any validation or type-checking code including boolean checks would likely be situated here to ensure valid construction of SQL for this lookup.\n- **Query.build_filter:** This method is responsible for building SQL filter clauses from filter expressions in the query construct. Correctly interpreting and validating those expressions, including handling specific behaviors like the 'isnull' lookup, ties closely to ensuring overall consistency.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n- Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 14)\n- Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 66)\n- Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 85)\n- Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 180)\n- Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 474)\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 14):** This adjusts the constructor of the `Lookup` class. It now checks if the lookup is 'isnull' and if the `rhs` value is a boolean before further preparations. If not, it raises a `TypeError`.\n- **Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 66):** Updates the `get_prep_lookup` method to add similar validation for 'isnull' lookups, raising a `TypeError`.\n- **Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 85):** Changes in the `process_rhs` method to validate the value for 'isnull' lookups, raising a `ValueError` if it\u2019s not a boolean.\n- **Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 180):** Adds validation in the `as_sql` method to ensure `rhs` is boolean before forming the SQL string.\n- **Django/db/models/lookups.py (line 474):** Alters the `as_sql` method of the `IsNull` class to perform checks directly and raise errors if `rhs` is not a boolean.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch Fixes the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the right functions. The methods having been modified (within the Lookup class and the IsNull specific class) are key points where inputs are verified before proceeding. Enhancements will effectively catch improper `rhs`, aligning with the issue\u2019s necessity to manage the boolean check for `__isnull` lookups.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if Patch Introduces New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe changes look generally good, though they are repetitive regarding putting the same `lhs and rhs` checks throughout the methods inside the same class.

It's crucial as it handles the RHS values for various potential filter types, ensuring that the correct error-raising logic for non-boolean values in '__isnull' lookup is valid and thorough.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch \n\n#### Curate the list of modified hunks:\n- Hunk affecting `__init__` method in `Lookup` class, line 14.\n- Hunk affecting `get_prep_lookup` method in `Lookup` class, line 66.\n- Hunk affecting `process_rhs` method in `Lookup` class, line 85.\n- Hunk affecting `as_sql` method in `Lookup` class, line 180.\n- Hunk affecting `as_sql` Method in `IsNull` class, line 474.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- `__init__` method: Adds code to validate if `rhs` is a boolean value when `lookup_name` is 'isnull'. Raises `TypeError` otherwise.\n  \n- `get_prep_lookup` method:  Adds code to validate if `self.rhs` is boolean if `lookup_name` is 'isnull'. Raises `TypeError` for invalid values.\n  \n- `process_rhs` method: Adds logic to raise `ValueError` if `value` (corresponding to `rhs`) is not a boolean and `lookup_name` is 'isnull'.\n  \n- `as_sql` method: New validation has been added to check if `self.rhs` is boolean for `__isnull` lookup, otherwise, it will raise `TypeError`.\n  \n- `IsNull.as_sql`: Performs RHS value validation to check if it is a boolean and raises `TypeError` for non-boolean values.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function or Not.\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct functions and classes to ensure that non-boolean values for the '__isnull' lookup raise appropriate errors. The insertion locations in `Lookup`, `IsNull`, and related processing methods are correct based on the code spans provided and the problem described in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues but repeats identical validation logic across several methods, potentially leading to repetitive code maintenance problems. Distribution of similar logic mandates high confidence during future adjustments causing enhanced maintenance overhead.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\nSeveral LLM-generated mistakes have been checked:\n- **Repetitive Code**: There is repetitive logic since almost the same boolean validation is present in various functions (`__init__`, `get_prep_lookup`, `process_rhs`, `as_sql` in Lookup, `IsSql.as_sql`).\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: The patch correctly uses exception raising within all related functions to enforce the boolean constraint.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The edge case where `rhs` for `__isnull` is non-boolean properly throws the `TypeError/ValueError`.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the fix addresses the specified issue correctly, it is repeated across multiple locations which indicates code redundancy. If these validations were centralized, it would be easier to maintain consistency and manage requirements in the future.\nTherefore, the ability and correctness of the fix should be considered at a high level but balanced with enhancement considerations regarding DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles.\nCritically, all necessary pathways ensure the problematic use case of non-boolean values for '__isnull' will appropriately notify developers, humane error handling is positively present.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring\nThus considering the correctness, and noting the redundancy which impacts the maintainability but not immediate efficiency or logic, assigning a fair score considering:\n\n<score>7</score>"

Consistently checking for boolean in one effective and well-placed check would be better.\n\n   The patch broadly intends to fix the issue but does so with excessively repetitive logic for string checks. It does introduce the correct type of integrity warning (`RemovedInDjango40Warning`) later, which partly aligns with the issue of non-boolean handling.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>5</score>"
