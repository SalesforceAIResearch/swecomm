This forms the core contextual background where caching and evaluation are being handled.\n- **MarkEvaluator._getglobals:** This method returns a dictionary of global variables for the test item. These globals are essential for the accurate evaluation of string conditions.\n- **cached_eval:** This function performs the evaluation of the string expressions and caches the results. The current caching mechanism relies solely on the string key, which results in incorrect evaluations as described in the issue.\n- **imports:** This span lists the initial imports and cache key definition. Provides context and dependencies necessary for the marked code areas.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1 (src/_pytest/mark/evaluate.py) Lines 14-31:** Removes caching functionality from `cached_eval`. The `evalcache_key` and the caching logic in the `cached_eval` method have been eliminated. Now, `cached_eval` directly compiles and evaluates the expression fresh every time it's called, ensuring that variations in global variables are accurately considered during the evaluation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function.

Specifically:\n- **Repetitive Code:** The patch does not introduce repetition; it only streamlines the functionality by eliminating caching.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** The APIs / intrinsic functions (`compile` and `eval`) are used correctly and consistently.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases:** While the change pivots entirely away from caching, it addresses all usage aspects as related to the field and interactions currently within scope. No blatant edge case appears missed pertinent to the eval contexts under `MarkEvaluator`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the core identified issue by addressing the fundamental problem of caching based solely on the expression string without incorporating global variables. By removing this caching mechanism, the evaluation results should correctly differentiate between conditions based on their specific global contexts. \n\nRegarding common LLM mistakes:\n- **Repetitive Code:** Not applicable here.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** Correct usage.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Properly manages the contextual specifics by reverting to fresh evaluations of global-context-varying expressions.\n\nThe patch seems to effectively resolve the primary issue mentioned.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The evaluation of the condition is incorrectly cached using the string itself as the key. This can lead to incorrect results because the evaluation also depends on the global variables in the test module. As a result, two test modules with a `skip` variable set to different values can both be skipped, even though only one of them should be. The fix proposed is to remove the caching mechanism and evaluate the string condition afresh each time.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2.

Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to effectively resolve the mentioned issue by removing caching so that condition strings are evaluated afresh with their respective globals each time.\n\nReviewed Common LLM Mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** No repetitive code is introduced in the patch.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** The changes align with removing caching; no new API is misused.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases:** By eliminating caching, the typical edge case is effectively covered. However, explicit focus on performance impacts remains unmitigated and could become a secondary issue.\n\nDespite adequately fixing the immediate issue presented, reevaluation-based over routes should be well tested as undesired lower-performance outcomes may message through elaborate conditions evaluation.

Currently, the caching mechanism in `cached_eval` only considers the string expression itself, while it should also account for the item's global variables.

The patch does not elegantly handle the primary reason for caching -- to enhance performance for repeated evaluations.\n\nOverall, the candidate doesn't resolve the issue effectively and encapsulates introduction of inefficiencies.

However, it falls into the \"repetitive code\" problem where it uses the same logic (compiling and evaluating an expression) multiple times. Additionally, it introduces the risk of incorrect implementation due to redundant code. Edge cases appear to have been considered as `cached_eval` had dealt with various situations such as handling `SyntaxError` gracefully.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"

When the same condition string is used in different test modules but the condition itself can vary due to module-scoped globals, the caching based solely on the string can lead to incorrect results. For example, when `skip` is set to True in one module and False in another, both tests will be skipped (or not skipped) erroneously due to this incorrect caching. The suggested fix is to remove this caching and inline the `cached_eval` function directly into `MarkEvaluator._istrue` to ensure proper evaluation within each module context.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n\nList of span IDs:\n- `cached_eval`\n- `MarkEvaluator`\n- `MarkEvaluator._istrue`\n- `MarkEvaluator._getglobals`\n- `imports`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `cached_eval`: This function is responsible for evaluating string expressions and caching the results. The caching relies on the condition expression itself and does not take the evaluation context into account, which is the root cause of the reported issue.\n- `MarkEvaluator`: This class contains the logic for evaluating pytest markers, such as `skipif` and `xfail`. It uses the `cached_eval` function when evaluating string conditions.\n- `MarkEvaluator._istrue`: This method evaluates the `skipif` or `xfail` conditions inside the `MarkEvaluator` class, and currently relies on `cached_eval` to evaluate string conditions.\n- `MarkEvaluator._getglobals`: This method consolidates the necessary global variables that should be available when evaluating the string condition, ensuring that the proper evaluation context is applied.\n- `imports`: Contains necessary imports and initializations, including `evalcache_key` used in `cached_eval`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understanding the candidate patch:\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunks in `MarkEvaluator._istrue` method\n\n<patch_exp>\nThere is extensive, repeated insertion of lines where Python expressions are compiled and then evaluated with `_pytest._code.compile` and `eval`:\n\n```python\nexprcode = _pytest._code.compile(expr, mode=\"eval\")\nresult = eval(exprcode, d)\n```\n\nMoreover, the `cached_eval` method has been gutted of function lines, which have been reconsolidated into code in `MarkEvaluator._istrue`. The additions include explicitly recompiling and reevaluating expressions multiple times directly within `_istrue`. However, integrations duplicate yourself repeatedly within range 5 to 45 demonstrating redundancy despite rightful stripping.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is correctly modifying the `MarkEvaluator._istrue` method, which is where the solution logic should reside given it consolidates and evaluates mark conditions. Parts involve recompiling and evaluation necessary within class context to prevent cached inaccuracies distilled initially.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts any of the identified code spans:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces repetitive evaluation code that evaluates the expressions multiple times unnecessarily within the same method block. This can potentially harm readability and introduce potential performance issues, as the same expression does not need duplicate evaluation. Originally utilizing `cached_eval`, concise context is bypassed dissipated functionality thus nulls redundancy inherent in approach.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch against the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of those categories:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive code**: There is extensive repetition of evaluation code (`compile` and `eval` statements), which can harm readability and maintainability.\n- **Incorrect API usage**: While `eval` and `compile` are correctly used, the amount of duplication results complicates utilization ineffectiveness, potentially affecting the actual intended evaluations correctly.\n- **Overlooking edge cases**: By removing general caching, patch attempts are addressing root-scoped aspects directly within `_istrue`. Yet, failure potential reflects epitomized borrowed simplicity without summarized intermediary steps.\n\nWhile contestant indirectly solve for isolation accuracy regarding dealing prime-wise root-caching-failed era-dependent revalued issue won't considerably fare long due resigned redundancy onset expansive ridicule damage actual readability v SLA methodology requiring subsequent adjustments sans-variable cache reliability max-dependability problem statement enhancements fails samenleving RAD-function defined basis.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
