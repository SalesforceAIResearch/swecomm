If any base class has a primary key defined, the check for an auto-created primary key is not raised. This is done by adding the line:\n     ```python\n     not any(hasattr(base, '_meta') and base._meta.pk for base in cls.__bases__)\n     ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_check_default_pk` method, which is the correct function responsible for generating the primary key warning relevant to this issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues and correctly integrates into the current check logic. It uses Python's built-in functions correctly to avoid redundant warnings about auto-created primary keys when an inherited model's ancestor has specified it.\n\nNo new logic contradicts any of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n- Repetitive code: No\n- Incorrect API usage: No\n- Overlooking edge cases: Potentially\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to be correctly formed by adding a new check to determine whether a primary key exists in any of the base classes which helps avoid auto-generated primary key related warnings. Therefore, it should fix the issue described.\n\nHowever, one potential improvement would be confirming it handles all forms of multiple inheritances and that the base class' `_meta` and `pk` handling covers partnered models.\n\nPotential edge cases such as models that inherit primary keys via a more complex class hierarchy should ideally still be validated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

If any base class has a primary key, the method will not raise the warning.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\nSince the issue is about warnings related to auto-created primary keys, it seems the `_check_default_pk` method would be the appropriate place for the fix.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies `_check_default_pk` in the Model class, which is the correct function handling warnings on auto-created primary keys.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\nNow we determine if the patch introduces new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues or introduce logic that contradicts identified code spans. It adds a condition to prevent the check failing when a base class already defines a primary key.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\nThe patch directly addresses the identified issue by adding a condition to ensure warnings aren't raised if a base class already defines a primary key.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to resolve the issue, ensuring no unnecessary warnings are raised by acknowledging inherited primary keys. However, it needs thorough testing for edge cases such as multiple inheritance scenarios.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\nEvaluating the patch against the criteria:\n\n<score>10</score>"
