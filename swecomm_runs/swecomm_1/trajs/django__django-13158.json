In such cases, an empty form submission results in all objects that match the queryset being added, rather than no objects being added. This behavior differs from using the logical OR (`|`) operator where an empty form submission results in no objects being added, which is the expected behavior.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2.

It clears the `combined_queries` to ensure an accurate empty result, which inline with expecting 'none' leads to an empty set. This solves the accidental adding of objects when a union is in use and the form is empty. However, closely examining: \n- **Repetitive Code:** None found in the modification.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** The combined_query manipulation is valid.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases:** The key edge case, combined queries existing, appears to have been addressed directly.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Understand the identified code spans:\n- Code Span IDs: [`QuerySet._chain`, `QuerySet._clone`, `QuerySet`, `QuerySet._combinator_query`, `QuerySet.none`, `QuerySet.union`]\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `QuerySet._chain`: This method provides a copy of the current `QuerySet` ready for another operation. An important step when handling updates within the `QuerySet.none` method.\n- `QuerySet._clone`: Similar to `_chain`, it clones the `QuerySet` but is a lightweight alternative to `deepcopy`. It\u2019s relevant because cloning is needed to safely alter queries without affecting the original `QuerySet`.\n- `QuerySet`: General context of where the `QuerySet.none()` method lives. It offers a lazy database lookup and is the main class these modifications pertain to.\n- `QuerySet._combinator_query`: This method handles the combination of multiple `QuerySet` instances using different combinators (`UNION`, intersection, etc.). It directly links to managing combined queries.\n- `QuerySet.none`: The method being identified to address the issue, responsible for returning an empty `QuerySet`. It performs chaining and then sets the query to empty, which is necessary to fix the issue.\n- `QuerySet.union`: This method combines multiple `QuerySet` instances using the SQL `UNION`. It's related to the issue due to the `union()` method in question.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch:\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk 1: Modifies `QuerySet.none` method in `django/db/models/query.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1:\n  - In `QuerySet.none` method: The original method sets the query to empty and returns the cloned `QuerySet`. The patch additionaly checks if the cloned query has `combined_queries` and, if yes, sets `combined_queries` to an empty tuple before returning the clone. This addresses the scenario directly linking to combined `QuerySet` issues referenced in the problem.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly placed within the `none` method of the `QuerySet` class. This is the right location since `QuerySet.none()` is identified with the behavior causing the issue. Adding a check for `combined_queries` directly addresses the described problem with combined query operations and their unexpected behavior.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch introduces any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict any identified code spans directly, however, introducing a direct modification to potentially change the construct of `combined_queries` might need more rigorous testing for side-effects impacting the `union` and associated methods. Edge cases where `combined_queries` have more complex nested queries wiring would need careful consideration.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive code**: There seems to be no repetitive code in this patch. The check for `combined_queries` and its subsequent modification is logically placed.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The usage isn't clear yes, but there's a valid pattern modifying internal structures directly isn't.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The patch might not account for `combined_queries` involving nested or more than basic common scenarios found in multi-faceted queries.\n\nThe general validation of combined operations procedures applying over a broader scope could expose edges cases making temporary loaders to validating patched issues returning SQL identified behavior impacting expectations could have beneficial attributes here thus scoring definition ranges purely. For purpose above issue boundaries the fix seems apt but post procedural coherent utility applicable drivers needs accounting.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The patch enhances this method by first checking if `self.combinator` is set (i.e., the query is a combined query) and, if so, clearing both `combined_queries` and `combinator`. This ensures that any combinator parameters are reset before the `NothingNode` is added, ultimately aiming to make the query truly \"empty\" even within combined contexts.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `set_empty` function, an appropriate place to address the issue in `none()` operations. Since `set_empty` is invoked by `none()`, ensuring it handles combined queries properly should resolve the inconsistent behavior.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to contradict any identified code spans but introduces a conditional check for `combinator`. Clearing `combined_queries` and `combinator` seem like safe operations; hence, it does not introduce any obvious new issues. However, thorough testing would be required to confirm this assumption across various use cases.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch intelligently considers the combinator query scenario detailed in the reported issue. It clarifies `combined_queries` and `combinator` before truly blanking the `QuerySet`, likely ensuring `none()` now works in union scenarios. No repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or unconsidered edge cases are apparent. Still, vigilance in testing for other possible combined queries scenarios and side effects remains necessary.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final score:**\n\n<score>9</score>"

If it does, `combined_queries` is set to an empty tuple, and `combinator` is set to `None`. Finally, the method proceeds to add a `NothingNode` to represent the empty state within `where` conditions. This ensures that the presence of combinators is handled separately before marking the query as empty.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `set_empty` function in Django's query handling mechanism, which is precisely where marking queries as empty should be managed, especially for ensuring combined queries return no results as expected when the `none()` method is invoked.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to contradict any of the identified code spans. It correctly handles clearing the combinator and combined queries before marking the query as empty. This conservative approach likely avoids introducing new issues by ensuring that previous combination states (like unions) are disconnected when marked empty.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive code**: The patch does not introduce any unnecessary repetition.\n- **Incorrect API usage**: The patch correctly uses internal mechanisms such as `combinator`, `combined_queries`, and `NothingNode`, suggesting a correct understanding of internal APIs.\n- **Overlooking edge cases**: The method makes an upfront check and handles the combinator state correctly, appearing to consider the edge case described in the issue. \n\nIt can be reasonably concluded that the patch correctly addresses the bug where `none()` did not work as expected with combined queries by dealing appropriately with possible combinators.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

While this patch addresses the specific problem, it's crucial to note some potential mistakes like:\n1. Incorrect API usage: Thorough testing is necessary to ensure clearing `combinator` does not affect other query aspects.\n2. Overlooking edge cases: Although the patch focuses on unions, other combinators (like intersections) should be tested for any similar issues to ensure consistency.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"
