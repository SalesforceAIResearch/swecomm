Specifically, the `cb.update_normal(mappable)` method has no effect, and the `cb.update_bruteforce(mappable)` method throws a `ZeroDivisionError`. The user is seeking a way to update the colorbar properly when the norm of the mappable object is changed.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n- List of span ids: \n  - `ScalarMappable.set_norm`\n  - `Colorbar._draw_all`\n  - `Colorbar.update_normal`\n  - `Normalize.vmin`\n  - `Normalize.vmax`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `ScalarMappable.set_norm`: This method sets the normalization instance for a mappable object. Changing the norm should ideally trigger updates in any associated colorbars.\n- `Colorbar._draw_all`: This function recalculates parameters and performs the full redraw for the colorbar, considering current color maps and normalization instances. It's integral for rendering the updated visual representation.\n- `Colorbar.update_normal`: This function is theoretically designed to handle updates when the normalization of a mappable changes, precisely the function mentioned in the issue. It connects directly to the attempt to update colorbar problems.\n- `Normalize.vmin` and `Normalize.vmax`: These are properties that return the minimum and maximum values for normalization, potentially involved with scaling and drawing which might be related to the division by zero error reported.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - **Hunk in `lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py` starting at line 572:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk at line 572 in `lib/matplotlib/colorbar.py`**: Adds `self.stale = True` after the existing `_draw_all` logic in the `Colorbar.update_normal` method. This line marks the colorbar as needing a redraw but does not directly alter `_draw_all` or error handling for `ZeroDivisionError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch introduces a change in the `_draw_all` method. Since `_draw_all` is indeed called within `update_normal`, the location for the modification seems logical. Identifying freshness and enforcing a redraw flag with `self.stale = True` ensures redraw in pending input/output which aligns with typical update routines.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nIntroducing `self.stale = True` marks the colorbar as requiring a redraw. While simplistic, it shouldn't conflict with code spans recognized. However, it doesn't directly mitigate `ZeroDivisionError`. Rather, it provisionally shows readiness which might not suffice as a side-help for encountered computation issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the color updating expediently, setting `self.stale = True` nudges proper refreshes. However:\n1. It side-steps `ZeroDivisionError`, crucially crucial from `inverse` often because back translated vmin/vmax interactions landed subdividing exceptions. \n2.

Relevant because updating the `norm` on the mappable directly affects how `norm.inverse` is used for the color bar.\n- `Colorbar._draw_all`: This method recalculates any parameters and performs all drawing actions for a color bar. Significant because this is where the color bar is redrawn and `_process_values` is called, influencing the update.\n- `Colorbar.update_normal`: Designed specifically to update a color bar when its associated `norm` changes, and relevant because it creates a pathway for re-drawing and re-calculating key features of a color bar's visualization.\n- `Normalize.vmin`: Provides access to the minimum value of normalization, crucial for understanding the bounds within which `norm.inverse` calculates to avoid zero division.\n- `Normalize.vmax`: Like `vmin`, provides access to the max value of normalization, essential in avoiding ZeroDivisionErrors within the norm calculation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

To ensure that the colorbar becomes dirty and is drawn anew after the drawing logic has been executed, a new line `self.stale = True` is added at the end of the drawing logic inside `_draw_all`. \n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `_draw_all` method in the `Colorbar` class. Since `_draw_all` is critical for calculating parameters based on `norm` and performing the mentioned drawing operations, updating it may address some underlying issues. The `stale` flag being set to True ensures that the colorbar knows it needs redrawing. Thus, the `_draw_all` method seems a suitable location to apply changes to achieve the intended fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere's no immediate indication that setting `self.stale = True` would directly introduce any new issues or contradict the other identified code spans within the demonstrated scope. However, simply flagging the colorbar as stale may not address the zero-division error from the norm range directly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nUpon reviewing the patch in context with the issue description, it seems that the main problem lies with handling norms like `LogNorm` which are sensitive to values and can end up causing division by zero if not appropriately addressed. The graphical rendering achieved indirectly by setting `self.stale` seems unrelated directly to resolving `ZeroDivisionErrors`. Thus, repetitive logic, incorrect API use, overlooking special norm-edge cases seem unhandled from the combination of the reports and exhibited snippets.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:**\n\n<score>3</score>"
