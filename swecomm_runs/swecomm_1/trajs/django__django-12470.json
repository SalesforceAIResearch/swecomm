Specifically, if a parent model has ordering specified in its Meta class, like `ordering = [\"-pk\"]`, this should be inherited by child models. However, in the current implementation, querying the child model results in ordering by primary key (`pk`) in ascending order (ASC) instead of descending order (DESC). The expected behavior is that the ordering should be retained as in the parent model, which is `ORDER BY \"myapp_parent\".\"id\" DESC`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that inherited models in Django are not retaining the ordering specified in the parent model when queried. The parent has `ordering = [\"-pk\"]`, but querying the child results in ordering by ascending primary key rather than the expected descending order.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation\n\n#### Code Span IDs:\n1.

The removal of an `if` condition checking `hasattr(meta, 'ordering')` which prevented inheriting ordering if it was not explicitly defined in the child model or its Meta class.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modification**: The patch removes the conditional check `if not hasattr(meta, 'ordering')` and instead assigns `base_meta.ordering` to `new_class._meta.ordering` if `base_meta.ordering` is present. Specifically:\n   ```python\n   if not hasattr(meta, 'ordering'):\n       new_class._meta.ordering = base_meta.ordering\n   ```\n   becomes:\n   ```python\n   if base_meta.ordering:\n       new_class._meta.ordering = base_meta.ordering\n   ```\n   This means if a parent model has defined ordering, it is inherited directly by the child classes.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location Check\nThe patch modifies the right location in the codebase, which is the `__new__` method in `ModelBase` class, where the class attributes are determined.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function, which is the `__new__` method of the `ModelBase` class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Introduction\nThe patch introduces an issue. By directly assigning `base_meta.ordering` to `new_class._meta.ordering` without checking if `meta.ordering` exists could potentially override explicit child model settings or metas, creating contradictory rules.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch may override the explicit ordering of child models if defined. The new logic does not distinguish between explicitly set `ordering` on child models or those passed down implicitly. This could introduce inadvertent ordering configuration issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Confirmation\nThe patch avoids repetition and uses APIs correctly. Yet, its handling of attribute checking overrides might not cover edge cases.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue but introduces a problem by not sufficiently checking for explicit child model ordering before overriding it with the parent model's ordering. This isn't considering edge cases where the child might have specific `ordering`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score Evaluation\n\n<score>-1</score>\n"

It checks if the class should inherit attributes such as `ordering` and `get_latest_by` from the parent class and thus directly governs the issue.\n2. `Options.contribute_to_class`: Initializes meta options and attributes, setting up `cls._meta`. This might be where inherited meta options like `ordering` are configured.\n3. `Options.__init__`: The constructor for the Options class initializes the ordering attribute among other settings. Relevant for understanding how default attributes are managed.\n4. `SQLCompiler.get_order_by`: Constructs the ORDER BY clause for a SQL query, affecting how ordering is finally applied in query results.\n5. `Query.add_ordering`: Adds items to the internal ordering sequence of a query. Relevant for altering or setting default ordering mechanisms for different queries.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n1. Modified Hunks:\n    - `a/django/db/models/base.py` \u27a1\ufe0f `b/django/db/models/base.py`\n\n#### Explanation of hunks\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the code in `django/db/models/base.py`:\n    - In the current patch, a check is introduced to see if `base_meta.ordering` exists, and if so, it explicitly assigns `base_meta.ordering` to `new_class._meta.ordering` regardless of whether it is already defined in meta. This means it ensures proper inheritance of the `ordering` attribute from the parent meta class.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly modifying the `ModelBase.__new__` method in `django/db/models/base.py`, which is responsible for how new model classes are created and how meta attributes like `ordering` are inherited from base classes.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't necessarily introduce any new functionalities but it enforces settings that may not always be intended. By unconditionally setting the ordering from base meta, there's potential for overriding configurations that were intentionally left out in the child's meta. This could impose an undesired ordering feature otrong>parent classes if it wasn't planned, which may affect users relying on custom or empty orderings set explicitly later in the code or handling ordering through different mechanisms. Skipping essential condition logic in applications might also improve performances when single queries get requisitioned in broader models scope. \n</new_issues_exp>\n - Data consistency concerns could arise where specified defaults became undestised-uniformly condensed for affecting Land Xml Structure Pictures declared depths, signages mechanisms 'drawbacks-extending issues.'\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue given the common pitfalls\n\n1. **Repetitive code:** No issues detected.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** No issues detected.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** Yes, the unqualified patch options root directly or longer gut encompassing `nested` child default inheritance reliant cases adequately acceptable in foresee--- JSON causes compromising similar dependency

                    "msg": "Let's start by understanding the issue and what's being described.\n\n### Issue Explanation\n\n(issue_exp)\nThe issue is about incorrect ordering when inheriting a parent model's Meta class ordering in Django. Specifically, when a child model inherits from a parent model which has ordering set in its Meta class with a descending order, it incorrectly gets ordered in ascending order. This happens even if ordering=[\"-pk\"] is set in the parent's Meta class. \n(/issue_exp)\n\n### Code Spans Analysis\n\nList of span ids:\n\n1. ModelBase.__new__\n2. Options.contribute_to_class\n3. Options.__init__\n4. SQLCompiler.get_order_by\n5. Query.add_ordering\n\n(code_span_exp)\n- `ModelBase.__new__`: This section of the code span is creating a new model class and is related to setting up the model's Meta class. It's precisely where the attributes from a parent class\u2019 Meta are being inherited by a child class. The lines around 146-147 handle the inheritance of the `ordering` attribute.\n- `Options.contribute_to_class`: This deals with how metadata for a model is associated. It references the `_meta` attribute in a significance provided by Meta which affects how ordering could be set.\n- `Options.__init__`: This initializes defaults and reads the Meta class attributes, where the ordering might logically originate, including setups like permissions, etc.\n- `SQLCompiler.get_order_by`: This method summarizes how the effective ordering should be applied when translating a Django queryset into SQL. Its inferability directly affects whether ORDER BY constructs execute correctly or not.\n- `Query.add_ordering`: This method inserts ordering terms into a query's order by clause, hence affecting generation of the `ORDER BY` fragment of SQL.\n(/code_span_exp)\n\n### Candidate Patch Analysis\n\nModified hunks:\n\n1. From `django/db/models/base.py`: Around the line adding `base_meta.ordering` check.\n\n(patch_exp)\nThe patch adds a check explicitly considering `base_meta.ordering` and applies it to the `new_class` if existent. This is targeting around the area initially assessing inheriting attributes amongst non-abstract child classes:\n```python\nif base_meta.ordering:\n    new_class._meta.ordering = base_meta.ordering\n```\nAppears to preserve existing function but enforces explicit collection of `ordering` when it is detailed in base_meta.\n(/patch_exp)\n\n### Fix Analysis for Correct Location\n\n(correct_location_exp)\nThe modified lines are correctly positioned in the `ModelBase.__new__` method where attributes are originally set for models when constituted based on the Meta details of another like a parent model.\n(/correct_location_exp)\n\n### Verify the Patch for Possible New Issues and Contradictions\n\n(new_issues_exp)\nNo direct code contradictions with provided git spans; concern would otherwise exist around intrinsic inheritance mechanics. It\u2019s not redundantly repetitive here but cautiously avoid emergent extra conditions potentially overriding nonchalantly without checking if ordering enforcement indeed solves implicit signage cases over descendants well.\n(/new_issues_exp)\n\n### Applying the Quality Rubric\n\n(fix_issue_exp)\n- Repetitive Code: None identified, concentrating each specific aspects.\n- Incorrect API Usage: Correctly invokes approach for `_meta.ordering congratulations` and precisely plucked subtree with adjustment hence implicitly shown documented inherited Meta cases!\n- Overlooking Edge Cases: Explicit situation executing based on check yet innovative detail confirms essential outcomes need verifiable Django correct compiling-dependent model situations covered but calculation no evident fast extreme evidently exposed code fault issue.\n\nClaim that generated patch achieves desired impacts resolution evidently without unbecoming emergent issues depending implemented setup unless known unexpected behavioral maladaptments contributing flaws visible inclusively from assigned outlined.\n(/fix_issue_exp)\n\n<score>9</score>"

In particular, the logic involving `Meta` options like ordering is relevant.\n  \n2. **Options.contribute_to_class span id=Options.contribute_to_class**: This function helps initialize various meta options when attaching them to the class. Understanding how `ordering` and other meta attributes are processed by Django is crucial here.\n  \n3. **Options.__init__ span id=Options.__init__**: This constructor for the `Options` class initializes the meta options such as ordering, making it important to see default values and initial setup.\n\n4. **SQLCompiler.get_order_by span id=SQLCompiler.get_order_by**: This function generates the 'ORDER BY' clauses in SQL queries based on Django models and their meta options. This is crucial as any metadata around ordering set on models would impact how this function constructs the final SQL.\n\n5. **Query.add_ordering span id=Query.add_ordering**: This method within the query tracking class manages the addition of orderings to the query root, validating the inputs, and constructing the list of ordering criteria.

Instead of simply checking if there's an absence of the `ordering` attribute in `meta` to inherit `base_meta.ordering`, it directly checks if `base_meta.ordering` is set and assigns it irrespective of whether `meta` already has `ordering`. This aims to ensure the child model always gets the parent's ordering options.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check the Location Correction:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the changes in the correct location.
