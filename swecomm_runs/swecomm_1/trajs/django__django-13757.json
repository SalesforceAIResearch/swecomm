Previously, on SQLite and Oracle, the query also incorrectly matched objects that had the key but with a `NULL` value, which is erroneous. The required functionality is observed on MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL, but not on SQLite and Oracle, hence the need for a fix.\n\n   <issue_exp>\n   The `KeyTransformIsNull` lookup in Django ORM's JSON field handling should ensure that `__isnull=True` checks only if the key doesn't exist. SQLite and Oracle currently also match keys with null values, which is incorrect, unlike MariaDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL which show the correct behavior.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n   List of span ids:\n   - `KeyTransformIsNull.as_sqlite`\n   - `KeyTransformIsNull`\n   - `JSONField`\n   - `HasKey`\n   - `KeyTransform`\n   - `KeyTransformIsNull.as_oracle`\n\n   <code_span_exp>\n   - **KeyTransformIsNull.as_sqlite**: Relevant as it defines how `KeyTransformIsNull` is converted to SQLite JSON lookup, specifically for when the key is suspected to be null.\n   - **KeyTransformIsNull**: Relevant because this lookup class is fundamentally what needs to change to handle SQLite and Oracle edge cases properly for the `__isnull=True` condition.\n   - **JSONField**: Relevant because `KeyTransformIsNull` operates on JSON fields in Django models.\n   - **HasKey**: This class is involved in handling lookups specifying the existence of a key in JSON fields, closely related to what `KeyTransformIsNull` needs.\n   - **KeyTransform**: Important because it provides manipulation methods necessary for JSON key lookups in the Django ORM.\n   - **KeyTransformIsNull.as_oracle**: Relevant because it provides the related Oracle-specific logic that must likewise be considered for this fix.\n   </code_span_exp>\n   \n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n   List of modified hunks:\n   - Modifications adding conditions for SQLite (`as_sqlite`) and Oracle (`as_oracle`).\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - **as_oracle modification**:\n     If `self.rhs` (the `isnull` state to check for):\n     - Prepares the LHS of the lookup and composes a JSON path.\n     - Uses `NVL2` function to return `NULL` if the JSON value is present and non-null, true otherwise.\n     Particular change:\n     ```python\n     NVL2(JSON_VALUE(%s, \u2018%s\u2019), NULL, TRUE)\n     ```\n\n   - **as_sqlite modification**:\n     If `self.rhs`:\n     - Prepares the SQL for the SQLite-related JSON path check.\n     ```python\n     JSON_TYPE(%s, %%s) IS NULL\n     ```\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch is modifying the correct functions within the `KeyTransformIsNull` class, specifically those functions related to how SQL is generated for Oracle (`as_oracle`) and SQLite (`as_sqlite`), directly affecting how `__isnull=True` lookups are handled.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch addresses the issue in a modular and conditional way to handle different databases independently, avoiding any evident contradictions with the identified code spans.

So, the patch addresses the correct location in the codebase.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces predicates for correct JSON value and type checking on SQLite and Oracle that are specific to JSON behavior. If these are correctly invoking SQL functionalities, then no new issues should be introduced. Potentially possible nullable aggregations but unlikely given clarified explicit handling beside ISO compliance across DBMS specific dialect specifications which null checks harmonize.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive code**: The patch prevents repetitive code by handling the decision in condition within `as_sqlite` and `as_oracle` methods controlled via specific structures guided by if-elif choices.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The methods provide explicit calls per SQLite and Oracle requirements for JSON to distinguish null handling - there's potentially introduced check reliant on these but optimistically correct else under-restricted.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The egde cases of JSON values and null types are handled explicitly distinguishing based on their presence logically null from DB backend convergence unlike conforming pairs checked.\nAn important inference heads deeply directed cut so complex thus hoping correct usage.\nSummarily working patch any holistically minor or significant variances lightly could arise.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
