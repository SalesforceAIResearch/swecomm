Specifically:\n\n- For models with foreign keys, the method returns a tuple with an empty dictionary.\n- For simple models without foreign keys, it returns a tuple with a dictionary containing model-label keys and zero values.\n\nThe expected behavior is that both cases should either have an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe inconsistency lies in the response of the `QuerySet.delete` method when no objects are deleted. When dealing with models with foreign keys, it returns `(0, {})`, while it returns `(0, {'model-label': 0})` for models without foreign keys. The user expects a consistent output in both cases.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\nList of span IDs:\n- Collector.delete\n- QuerySet.delete\n\nExplanation:\n- **`Collector.delete`:** This method contains the logic for deleting objects and collects information about how many of each type were deleted. It also prepares the final result dictionary. This is directly related to the issue because this is the method that produces the different output formats identified in the issue.\n  \n- **`QuerySet.delete`:** This method calls `Collector.delete` and returns its tuple. It is relevant because this is where the inconsistency in the results affects the response of an API (QuerySet) commonly used by developers.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1.

It's critical to the described issue because it's directly responsible for producing the inconsistent output (different dictionary formats).\n\n2. QuerySet.delete: This function is invoking `Collector.delete` and returning its tuple output. Any fixes to address the described issue would resultantly be triggered in this layer when queried.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in Collector.delete near line 389.\n2. Modification in Collector.delete near line 410.\n\nExplanation:\n- **First Hunk (389):** Initializing `deleted_counter` with a dictionary that contains model labels with a value of 0 for each model listed in `self.data`. This ensures that if no objects are deleted, an entry for each model with zero deletions will still be present in the output.\n\n- **Second Hunk (410):** This portion doesn't directly change; it maintains the logic cleanly to keep the keys updated based on deletion results. Any further interactions maintain the model-key entries format consistent as begun in the first hunk.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. First Hunk (src line 389): Initializes the deleted_counter Counter with zeros for each model's label. This ensures a uniform return format of the dictionary regardless of objects being deleted or not.\n2. Second Hunk (Noodles carried): Retains logic for counting individual model-deletes, ensuring consistency towards continuing to fill-in data for initialized variables.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\nYes, the patch is making changes in the `Collector.delete` function, which are responsible for tallying up and returning the delete counts. Since `QuerySet.delete` essentially calls this function, fixing the tallying approach here fits.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the correct function, as it targets the `Collector.delete`, which is directly responsible for creating the result tuple returned by `QuerySet.delete`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\nThe changes do not overwrite or directly contradict other critical portions within the identified spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and aligns cleanly with the structuring within the existing logic in `Collector.delete`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\nThe patch addresses inconsistencies effectively by standardizing the result such that each model label initialized to zero counts, regardless of objects deleted or not.\n\n- **Repetitive Code:** The patch does not introduce any repetitive code.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** The modifications made take into account the original logic, maintaining proper API calls without errors.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases:** The logic adjustment definitely takes into account cases for emptiness by involving initialization.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch accurately aligns with requirements to fix inconsistent output tuple result from `QuerySet.delete`. Changes made diligently standardize output, factoring into properly reverting dictionaries to return model labels set 0 count values. It provide consistent dictionary output place for all situations-the former exceptions now covered resolved.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understanding the Issue\nThe issue description indicates there's an inconsistency in the result format of the `QuerySet.Delete` method when no objects are deleted. Specifically, models with foreign keys return an empty dictionary, while \"simple\" models without foreign keys include a dictionary with model-label keys set to zero value, when zero objects are deleted.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about achieving consistency in the result format of the `QuerySet.Delete` method when zero objects are deleted. Currently, models with foreign keys return an empty dictionary, while simple models without foreign keys return a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values, leading to inconsistency.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understanding the Identified Code Spans\nList of span IDs: `Collector.delete`, `QuerySet.delete`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **Collector.delete**: This span is essential because it contains the logic where objects are collected and deleted.

Understanding the Candidate Patch\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in `django/db/models/deletion.py` starting at line 381.\n2. Modification in `django/db/models/deletion.py` starting at line 410.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modification at line 381**: The patch initializes the `deleted_counter` dictionary with all model label keys set to 0 before performing any deletions.\n2. **Modification at line 410**: No direct change here, continued logic from the refactored dictionary initialization.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Checking the Correct Location\nThe patch modifies the `Collector.delete` method to ensure that the deleted counter starts with entries for all models set to zero. Since the reported inconsistencies stem from the `Collector.delete` method, the fix seems to be applied to the correct function.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct function, `Collector.delete`, which is responsible for managing deletion and maintaining the deleted object counts.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Checking for New Issues\nThe patch introduces a default setup for `deleted_counter` that includes zeros for models right from the start. It seems additive rather than disruptive and should not introduce new issues. There\u2019s no contradiction with the identified code spans since the modification logically extends how a `Counter` object is prepared.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues nor does it contradict any of the identified code spans.

This directly impacts the inconsistent deletion results mentioned in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any significant new issues. The idea to initialize `deleted_counter` with zero values for each model's label at the start smooths out edge cases and provides consistency across all cases. However, modifying initialization should ensure that all collected models are accounted for correctly and potential unused key-value pairs might exist in results.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n   \n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to address the reported issue by ensuring that every model, whether having zero deletions or not, is included in the deleted counter initialization step. This avoids inconsistent return results by having each model label as key mapped to zero initially. A thorough examination suggests that the common mistake of overlooking edge cases, repetitive code, and API misuse appear avoided in this context.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Specifically, for models with foreign keys, it returns `(0, {})`, while for simple models without foreign keys, it returns `(0, {'model_label': 0})`. The expected behavior is that both cases should either return an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model labels as keys and zero as values when no objects are deleted.\n\nOutput:\n<issue_exp>The issue involves inconsistent result formats from the QuerySet.delete method. When zero objects are deleted: models with foreign keys return (0, {}), while models without foreign keys return (0, {'model_label': 0}). The expectation is for a consistent result, with both cases returning the same format.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n\nList of span ids: `Collector.delete`, `QuerySet.delete`\n\nExplanation:\n- `Collector.delete`: This span defines the `Collector.delete` method, which handles the deletion process and builds the counter dictionary for the models and total deletions. It directly relates to how the results of the delete operations are formulated.\n- `QuerySet.delete`: This span defines the `QuerySet.delete` method, showing how `Collector` is utilized to execute the delete operation on a QuerySet. The modifications to this span influence how deletions are managed across the database for different models and directly affect the overall output format.\n\nOutput:\n<code_span_exp>\n- The span `Collector.delete` contains the centralized logic for deleting instances and returning the counts of deleted objects, which is where the issue originates concerning inconsistencies in return format.\n- The span `QuerySet.delete` handles the high-level deletion operation on QuerySets and incorporates `Collector`, thereby also participating in forming the final output affected by `Collector.delete`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\nModified Hunks:\n```plaintext\n1. --- a/django/db/models/deletion.py:381\n   +++ b/django/db/models/deletion.py:381\n2. --- a/django/db/models/deletion.py:410\n   +++ b/django/db/models/deletion.py:410\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- **Hunk 1:** Initializes the `deleted_counter` with zero counts for each model label present in `self.data`. Instead of starting with an empty Counter, it now includes zero counts from the beginning for each model involved.\n- **Hunk 2:** Preserves and updates the logic of the deletion count and counter in alignment with the modified initialization so the counter ensures all models' labels appear as zero if no entries are present to delete initially.\n\nOutput:\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the initialization of `deleted_counter` so that it starts with a dictionary of each model key having a 0 count.\n2. This retains the logical update pattern for handling deletions and now correctly checks and counts updates in alignment with the zero-count initialization.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking the Correct Function Fix**\n\nThe patch modifies `Collector.delete`, and this function is indeed responsible for the significant task of deleting and counting database records, making it consistent. This location inclusion ensures central influence to punched issues affecting models running delete protocol and encompassing counters.\n\nOutput:\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch modifies the correct function, `Collector.delete`, which is central to handling the delete logic and ensuring consistent output formats for deleted counts.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking for New Issues**\n\nThe patch modifies only the way `deleted_counter` gets initialized, ensuring no label is missed even if counts result in zero updates. It aligns well and fix conforms logically without introducing notable or incorrect variances against identified spans.\n\nOutput:\n<new_issues_exp>No, the patch does not introduce any new issues and aligns appropriately with existing code spans.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue**\n\n- **Repetitive Code:** No evident issue with repetitive elements.\n- **Incorrect API usage:** Proper initialization tuning and correct usage inferred.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases:** The patch specifically addresses zero-objects case and ensures model label continuity by initialization.\n\nOutput:\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch correctly sets the zero-initialized values for model labels in `deleted_counter` to ensure consistent output for all scenarios.

Understanding the candidate patch:\n\nThe modified hunk:\n\n<before_patch>\n<before_file=\"a/django/db/models/deletion.py\" start_line=437>\n(0437)         # update collected instances\n(0438)         for instances_for_fieldvalues in self.field_updates.values():\n(0439)             for (field, value), instances in instances_for_fieldvalues.items():\n(0440)                 for obj in instances:\n(0441)                     setattr(obj, field.attname, value)\n(0442)         for model, instances in self.data.items():\n(0443)             for instance in instances:\n(0444)                 setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)\n(0445)         return sum(deleted_counter.values()), dict(deleted_counter)\n</before_file>\n</before_patch>\n\n<after_patch>\n<after_file=\"b/django/db/models/deletion.py\" start_line=437>\n437:         # update collected instances\n438:         for instances_for_fieldvalues in self.field_updates.values():\n439:             for (field, value), instances in instances_for_fieldvalues.items():\n440:                 for obj in instances:\n441:                     setattr(obj, field.attname, value)\n442:         for model, instances in self.data.items():\n443:             for instance in instances:\n444:                 setattr(instance, model._meta.pk.attname, None)\n445:         return (\n446:             sum(deleted_counter.values()),\n447:             {k: v for k, v in deleted_counter.items() if v},\n448:         )\n</after_file>\n</after_patch>\n\nThe patch at `django/db/models/deletion.py` modifies the return format of the `delete` function by filtering out keys from `deleted_counter` which have zero values. Thus, the result would be `(0, {})` regardless of whether the models have a foreign key or not.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk changes the return format of the delete function to always exclude entries in `deleted_counter` with a zero value. This ensures that an empty dictionary is returned when no objects are deleted, making the return format consistent.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n\nYes, the correct function is being modified since `Collector.delete` is where the inconsistency noted in the issue stems from, as indicated by the provided code spans.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the correct function, `Collector.delete`, which computes the result of deletions and directly deals with the deleted counter dictionary.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\nThere doesn't appear to be any contradiction with the identified code spans. The patch addresses the primary focus: including only those entries in `deleted_counter` which are non-zero.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues or contradictions with any of the identified code spans. It aligns well with the primary requirement indicated by the code and issue.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n\nThe patch fixes the issue by addressing a consistent result format for delete operations, preventing entries with zero values from being included in the `deleted_counter` result. There's no indication of repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or overlooked edge cases within the context.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the issue by ensuring the deletion result only includes non-zero entries in the deleted_counter, making the result format consistent for cases when no objects are deleted. The common mistakes by LLMs have been considered and are not apparent in this patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
