However, an edge case it might overlook is whether additional related components (like child elements) need handling too; contextually, though, checking visibility at the highest level should suffice.\n\nTherefore, the patch successfully resolves the issue of making the 3D subplot disappear when expected.\n<fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Furthermore, within this hunk, old code seemed to be removed without preserving the original flow. Lines reordering patches and drawing of panes and axes show repetitive calls.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The method `set_visible` belongs naturally in the `Axes3D` class, which determines visibility at the object's level. The additional check within the `draw` method ensures that the painter\u2019s algorithm acknowledges the visibility state.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking for new issues introduced by the patch:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces several repetitive checks inside the `draw` method. Starting from line 411 onwards, the same visibility condition is redundantly checked multiple times before proceeding with draw operations. This repetition introduces clutter in the code and ruins readability.\n\nSecondly, the application of aspect operations has been disrupted and stuffed into inappropriate places, again turning the control flow into something unclear. The repetitive checks inside mislead the readers of inherent operations meant generally within `draw`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nAlthough the addition of `set_visible` would set the `_axis3don` flag and interact suitably signaling visibility states within `Axes3D`, the redundancies introduced hamper the proper clean conditional aspects. While introducing `set_visible` correctly, the extreme replication-deferred visibility checks diverge logical structuring in `draw`, thus susceptible to create unpredictable functional generalities.\n\n- Explored common mistakes:\n  1. **Repetitive code**: Yes, unnecessary checks created repetitive extra steps.\n  2. **Incorrect API usage**: No explicit API analysis utilized here aside upper level conditional correctness shown.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7.

Specifically, setting a subplot's visibility to `False` using `set_visible(False)` is not making the subplot disappear as expected.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that `set_visible(False)` does not hide the subplot when it is using a 3D projection.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n\nHere are the list of span IDs:\n- Axes3D.draw\n- Axes3D.clear\n- Axes3D\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **Axes3D.draw**: This method is responsible for drawing the 3D axes and its components.

Addition of `set_visible()` method to `Axes3D`.\n2. Modification of the `draw()` method logic to account for the visibility state.\n\n#### Hunk 1: \n- **Before Patch**: None, as this is added code.\n- **After Patch**: The patch introduces a new `set_visible()` method for handling the visibility.\n```python\ndef set_visible(self, b):\n    self._axis3don = b\n    super().set_visible(b)\n    self.stale = True\n```\n**Explanation**: This method overrides the parent class's `set_visible()` to also set the `_axis3don` attribute and mark the figure as stale, affecting subsequent draw calls.\n\n#### Hunk 2:\n- **Before Patch**: Original drawing logic.\n- **After Patch**: New checks (repeated excessively) in the `draw` method.\n```python\nif not self.get_visible():\n    return\n```\n**Explanation**: Checks to ensure the `Axes3D` is only drawn if its visibility is set to `True`. However, this check is unnecessarily repeated many times.\n \n<patch_exp>\n1. Addition of `set_visible()` method, which aims to control visibility state and subsequently set the visibility using the parent class method.\n2. Modified `draw()` method to condition rendering based on the visible state of the axes. Repetitive checks for `get_visible()` are introduced before drawing child components.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n\nThe candidate patch modifies the `Axes3D` class by adding a new method to manage visibility and alters the `draw()` method logic, which is central to rendering and thus visibility. Therefore, it seems to be fixing the correct class and relevant functions associated with rendering.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct class and functions within `Axes3D` responsible for drawing and its visibility state.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing new issues\n\nThere are new issues with the patch:\n1. The `draw()` method modifications include redundant visibility checks, leading to an adversely impacted and severely inefficient rendering path.\n2. There are unresolved syntax errors with repeated line numbers, disrupting logical consistency and leading to potential runtime errors.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces repetitive visibility checks within the `draw` method and has several duplicated lines due to probable copy-pasting errors, leading to efficiency loss and potential logical errors.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\nLet\u2019s examine possible common LLM mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The `draw()` method exhibits serious redundancy with repeated checks for visibility, worsening performance by unnecessarily repeating the same logic.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: No mistakes here, functions are correctly used in the added `set_visible()`.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Potential edge cases around rendering pipeline failures due to hacky repeated codes have been missed.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nDespite addressing the core functionality envisaged by adding `set_visible()` and extending draw logic with visibility checks, severe code repetition introduces inefficiency and logical errors, meaning the patch does not properly fix the issue and introduces new ones.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Conclusion and Scoring\n\nWhile the patch correctly identifies and attempts to address the core bug, it introduces severe inefficiencies and logical issues stemming from sloppy repeated code within the `draw` function.\n\n<score>-1</score>"
