Currently, it uses `sys.argv[0]` for this purpose rather than an already computed `prog_name`. Changing the `CommandParser` instantiation to utilize `self.prog_name` instead of `'%(prog)s'` in `usage` will address the issue.\n\n   ```issue_exp```ManagementUtility's `execute` method currently uses `sys.argv[0]` to derive the program's name for the `CommandParser`. By passing `self.prog_name` directly at instantiation, this pertains to ensuring better handling of the program name in environments where `sys.argv[0]` might be `None` or wrongly set.```/issue_exp```\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**\n\n   - List of Span IDs: `ManagementUtility.execute`, `ManagementUtility`.\n\n   ```code_span_exp``` \n   - `ManagementUtility.execute`: This code span contains the code related to initializing the `CommandParser` without the `prog` argument and handling arguments like `--settings` and `--pythonpath`.
