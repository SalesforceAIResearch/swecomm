ValidationError.__init__\n\nFor `ValidationError`:\nThis is the declaration of the `ValidationError` class. Any modification related to implementing `__eq__` for this class will need to be included here.\n\nFor `ValidationError.messages`:\nThis is a property method that constructs a list of error messages from the `ValidationError` instance, taking into account both `error_dict` and `error_list`. Since the comparison logic will involve error messages, understanding this method is crucial.\n\nFor `ValidationError.__init__`:\nThis is the initializer method of the `ValidationError` class and shows how various forms of messages are normalized and stored. Knowing this helps ensure that the `__eq__` method takes into account the different types and structures of messages that might be part of a `ValidationError`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.
