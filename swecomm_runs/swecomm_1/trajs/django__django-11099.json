The change from `r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'` to `r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'` correctly addresses the issue without creating contradictions with the identified code spans.\n   ```\n\n6. **Issue Fix Check**\n\n   ```fix_issue_exp\n   The patch addresses the issue effectively by using `\\A` and `\\Z` anchors instead of `^` and `$`, which correctly ensure that trailing newlines are not permitted in usernames. It adheres to the suggested modifications and correctly updates both affected validators.

Imports\n\nExplanation:\n- **ASCIIUsernameValidator**: This span includes the `ASCIIUsernameValidator` class definition, which contains the regex pattern that erroneously allows trailing newline characters. It's essential to the issue because the regex pattern here needs adjustment.\n- **UnicodeUsernameValidator**: Similar to `ASCIIUsernameValidator`, this span encompasses the `UnicodeUsernameValidator` class definition with the regex that also incorrectly permits trailing newlines.\n- **Imports**: This contains necessary imports for the file. It's not directly related to the regex logic, but it's contextually relevant for understanding dependencies and module composition.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Hunk modifying the `ASCIIUsernameValidator`\n2. Hunk modifying the `UnicodeUsernameValidator`\n\nExplanation:\n1. **Hunk modifying the `ASCIIUsernameValidator`**:\n   Before change:\n   ```python\n   regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n   ```\n   After change:\n   ```python\n   regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n   ```\n   The regex pattern within `ASCIIUsernameValidator` is updated from `^[\\w.@+-]+$` to the desired `\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z`, preventing trailing newlines.\n   \n2. **Hunk modifying the `UnicodeUsernameValidator`**:\n   Before change:\n   ```python\n   regex = r'^[\\w.@+-]+$'\n   ```\n   After change:\n   ```python\n   regex = r'\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z'\n   ```\n   Similarly, the regex pattern in `UnicodeUsernameValidator` is altered to `\\A[\\w.@+-]+\\Z` to ensure no trailing newlines are accepted.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the validators `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, which are indeed the relevant locations according to the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch uses the correct regex expressions, \\A and \\Z, and doesn't introduce any new issues. There are no contradictions with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively corrects the issue by replacing the end-of-string marker `$` with `\\Z` in the regex patterns. This prevents the validators from accepting usernames that end with newline characters. The changes do not repeat any logic, use correct API/regex features, and cover the principal edge case described (i.e., trailing newline prevention). Hence, the patch does not exhibit any of the commonly made mistakes by LLMs.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
