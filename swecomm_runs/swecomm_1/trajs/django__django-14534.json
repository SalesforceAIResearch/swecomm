BoundWidget\n2. BoundField.subwidgets\n3. BoundWidget.id_for_label\n</span_ids>\n- **BoundWidget**: This class is central to the issue because it is the target class where the id_for_label method resides. The problem lies directly in how this method creates the id for subwidgets.\n- **BoundField.subwidgets**: The subwidgets method in the BoundField class initializes the BoundWidget instances and sets attributes, including ids. It becomes relevant because it highlights where the id might initially be correctly set before being overlooked by the BoundWidget.\n- **BoundWidget.id_for_label**: This is the precise piece of code that exhibits the inappropriate default id creation logic. It's the location targeted for the fix.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<hunks>\n1. The id_for_label method in the BoundField class was updated to prioritize fetching the 'id' from self.data['attrs']. If not found, it falls back on the original behavior.\n2. BoundWidget class got a new get_id_for_label method that contains the logic to check for the id in self.data['attrs'] first, and only if it's not found, create the default id using name and index.\n3. Minor adjustment in the BoundWidget initializer to ensure attrs dictionary exists.\n4. The id_for_label property in the BoundWidget class now calls get_id_for_label method for obtaining id.\n5. Updated use of id_for_label in the subwidgets method of BoundField.\n</hunks>\n- **Hunk 1**: This modifies the id_for_label method of the BoundField class, making it check for an id in self.data['attrs'] first, if unavailable, it reverts to the default widget.id_for_label(id_).\n- **Hunk 2**: This introduces a new method get_id_for_label to encapsulate the logic and simplify the property id_for_label. Resulting id is either from the data attrs or constructed.\n- **Hunk 3**: This adjusts the BoundWidget __init__ to ensure attrs exists by adding an empty dictionary if it's not already in the data.\n- **Hunk 4**: This changes how the BoundWidget.id_for_label property works by delegating to the newly introduced get_id_for_label.\n- **Hunk 5**: pushed some changes in behavior of subwidgets creation based on id we're determined using new logic.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch code edits the id_for_label function in the BoundWidget class directly, which is the correct location for resolving the described issue as specified in the issue. The new checks introduced are aligned within proper BoundWidget areas and stick to modification.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo apparent new issues are introduced by the patch itself. However, passing through BoundWidget initial modification becoming core sidestep potential backward compatibility issue due to functional changes, And requires careful re-checking how self.data.added.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch largely handles accurate handling based on manually sets \u201cattrs\u201d within the id situated within id_for_label methods, updated structure minimizing introduced discrepancies. \nChecking for repeating logic/block means accumulative task that binds all spent level subinterest, once transitioned rule blocks appeared effectively pave way constituted frees tweak avoidance side effect through BoundField autos observes recomposition.

This behavior causes confusion and unexpected results when a specific `id` is specified using the `auto_id` argument because the custom `id` should be used but is effectively ignored by `BoundWidget`. \n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the `id_for_label` method of the `BoundWidget` class does not utilize the `id` specified by `ChoiceWidget.options`, leading to incorrect handling of custom `id` values set via `auto_id`.

It's the source of `self.data['attrs']['id']` which should be utilized in the `BoundWidget.id_for_label` method. It demonstrates where the relevant `id` is defined.\n\n3. **BoundWidget.id_for_label**: This method invents its own `id` using a pattern.
