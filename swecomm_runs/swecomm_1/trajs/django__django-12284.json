                    "msg": "1. Understanding the issue:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue revolves around the `get_FOO_display()` method in Django models, which is supposed to return a display name for a choice field instead of its raw value. Specifically, when a child model inherits from a parent model and overrides its choices, the `get_FOO_display()` method does not return the correct display names for the new choice values added in the child model. Essentially, if the parent model has choices A and B and the child model adds choice C, `get_FOO_display()` works correctly for A and B but returns 'C' instead of the corresponding display name for C.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n\nIdentified code span ids: `Model._get_FIELD_display`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Model._get_FIELD_display`: This method is responsible for formatting and returning the display value of a field's current value based on its choices. It's relevant to the issue because any modifications to how `get_foo_display()` operates could involve changes in how `_get_FIELD_display` translates values to display names.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understanding the candidate patch:\n\nModified hunks: \n\n- Changes in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` around line 759:\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The original code checks if `cls` already has an attribute whose name matches `self.attname` to conditionally set `cls[self.attname]` to `self.descriptor_class(self)`. \n- It also checks if `cls` does not already have the method `get_<field name>_display`.\n- The patch removes the check and uses a more precise condition to check if the class's `__dict__` attribute doesn't already include `get_<field name>_display`.\n\nThe change ensures that the overridden choices in the inherited child model are better accounted for, thus resolving the inconsistency described in the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The change is made in the area of code responsible for dynamically generating the `get_<field name>_display` methods when fields are added to models.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any new issues related to the identified code span. Removing the possibility of conflict in class hierarchies by making the code use `__dict__` ensures that custom methods are correctly overwritten, which aligns with the typical behavior desired.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does address the issue and attempts to prevent missed proper display values in inherited choices. It avoids common LLM errors:\n1. Repetitive code: The code isn't repetitively calling the same logic.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The patch employs Python's class dictionaries correctly.\n3. Edge cases: The change tends to consider overwrite scenarios for classes derived from abstract base models.\n\nTherefore, it likely resolves the described problem without notably falling into common LLM mistakes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Specifically, if a derived model class adds new choices to an existing field, the new choices aren't returned correctly when using `get_FOO_display()`. The method works as expected for choices present in the base model but fails to handle the new choices added in the derived class properly. An underlying example demonstrates that choices (\"C\", \"output3\") added for the derived class instance `B` are not returned correctly.\n\n**My Explanation:**\n<issue_exp>\nThe problem is that the `get_FOO_display()` method does not handle new choices added in a derived model class properly. For example, values \"A\" and \"B\" are resolved correctly, but value \"C\" added in the derived class does not return the expected output.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n**Span IDs:**\n- Model._get_FIELD_display\n\n**Code Span Relevance:**\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Model._get_FIELD_display`: This method retrieves and returns the display value (i.e., human-readable name) corresponding to a field's choice. The issue possibly lies here, where the method may not correctly account for additional choices defined in derived classes.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n**Modified Hunks:**\n- `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n \n**Patch Explanation:**\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch modifies the handling of the `get_FOO_display` method with:\n1. Original check:\n   ```python\n   if not hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name):\n   ```\n   This checks if the `get_FOO_display()` method already exists for the field.\n\n2. Modified check:\n   ```python\n   if 'get_%s_display' % self.name not in cls.__dict__:\n   ```\n   This alteration seeks to ensure that the `get_FOO_display()` method is directly defined in `cls.__dict__` and not inherited inadvertently or overridden in derived classes. It attempts a more rigid verification whether the display method exists directly in the class `__dict__`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. It ensures that the `get_FOO_display` method is directly defined within the class dictionary (`__dict__`). This could prevent inherited choices from the base class from conflicting.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch introduces any new issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe key modification here is to check `cls.__dict__` for the existence of the method instead of `hasattr()`. The revised check more tightly controls whether `get_%s_display` was precisely defined in the inheritance hierarchy. It shouldn't introduce any significant new issues, but we need careful observation. There might be slight performance considerations or unexpected inheritance anomalies.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue and for common mistakes\n**Patch Evaluation against Common Mistakes:**\n- Repetitive Code: The patch does not introduce repetitive code; it instead tightens method existence verification.\n- Incorrect API Usage: The patch uses valid access to inspect the class dictionary directly via `__dict__`.\n- Overlooking Edge Cases: The modification aim is to address inherited choices explicitly, so it's more inclusive of the clearly illustrated issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch improvises a stricter checks intrinsic to fixing the demonstrated issue by leveraging `cls.__dict__` over `hasattr()`. This approach proves contextually relevant and addresses the lack of Field Display inheritance perception by meticulously checking for explicit definitions (summing elements handle populated edge cases).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n**Score Calculation:**\n1. Subtraction for contradictions: 0 points (none found)\n2. Subtraction for modified/extensively checked method correctness: 0 points \n3. New Issues: No significant ones; warranty micro-performations-/inheritance assessments, not override design usability.\n\nTherefore, appropriatively evaluated the score stands optimally-designated numerical rating score substantively and accurately benefiting issue rebuttal control pedigree integrity.\n\n<score>8</score>"

SPAN_ID: Model._get_FIELD_display\n   Explanation: This method in `django/db/models/base.py` is directly responsible for getting the display value for a field that has choices defined. It converts the field's value into its corresponding display value from the choices. Therefore, understanding it is crucial to address why the new choices added in an inherited model aren't working as expected.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

The patched code changes this check to look specifically in `cls.__dict__`, ensuring that it doesn't inherit and incorrectly recognize a method from a parent class.

Instead of using `hasattr`, which checks for inherited methods, it uses `cls.__dict__`, which restricts the check to explicitly declared methods. This change resolves the problem as described:\n1. It removes the potential inheritance oversight by narrowing down the check.\n2. The patch moves away from repetitive logic.\n3. Correct API usage retains conformity with original Django conventions.\nHowever, since this simple check may overlook cases where metaclasses or dynamic attributes complicate scenarios, more thoroughgoing test coverage isn't delineated but highly advisable.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
