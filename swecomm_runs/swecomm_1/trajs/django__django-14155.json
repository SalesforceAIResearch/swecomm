When a `functools.partial` function is passed as the view, the `__repr__` method displays it generically as `functools.partial` without showing the underlying function or the arguments provided. The issue can be resolved by unwrapping `functools.partial` objects in the `ResolverMatch.__init__()` method so their underlying function and arguments can be displayed appropriately in the `__repr__()` method.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**:\n   \n   **List of span ids**:\n   - ResolverMatch\n   - ResolverMatch.__init__\n   - URLPattern.lookup_str\n   - ResolverMatch.__repr__\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **ResolverMatch**:\n   This is the class whose `__repr__` method is having the issue with `functools.partial`.\n\n2. **ResolverMatch.__init__**:\n   Constructor method of the `ResolverMatch` class which initializes the internal state of the class. This is where the unwrapping of `functools.partial` objects should happen.\n\n3. **URLPattern.lookup_str**:\n   This represents another piece of related logic handling `functools.partial` objects, ensuring the correct function string is returned. It is useful as reference to see correct handling of `functools.partial`.\n\n4. **ResolverMatch.__repr__**:\n   This method defines how the `ResolverMatch` class instances are represented as strings and it's currently displaying `functools.partial` objects generically. It needs adjustments to properly reflect underlying functions and arguments.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n  \n   **List of modified hunks**:\n   - Hunk 1: Changes in the `ResolverMatch.__init__` method.\n   - Hunk 2: Changes in the `ResolverMatch.__repr__` method.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1: Changes in ResolverMatch.__init__**:\n    - Added check to see if `func` is an instance of `functools.partial`.\n    - If so, unwrap its underlying `func`, `args`, and `keywords` and store them in `self.func`, `self.partial_args`, and `self.partial_kwargs`.\n    - If not, initialize `self.partial_args` and `self.partial_kwargs` with empty values.\n\n2. **Hunk 2: Changes in ResolverMatch.__repr__**:\n    - Added conditional check to see if there are any `partial_args` or `partial_kwargs`.\n    - If yes, include them in the string representation.\n    - If no, fall back to the usual representation which does not support `functools.partial`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct method, `ResolverMatch.__init__`, because it is responsible for initializing the internal state of the `ResolverMatch` object, which needs to be updated to correctly reflect any `functools.partial` objects. Properly unwrapping in `__init__` allows the `__repr__` method to correctly format these partials.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It maintains the original functionality while enhancing it to handle `functools.partial` instances. Additionally, there are no direct conflicts with the identified code spans; it integrates seamlessly to improve how partial functions are represented.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by unwrapping the `functools.partial` in the constructor and including its details in the representation string if applicable. However, we should ensure there are no commonly made mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: No repetitive patterns observed.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Correct usage of `functools.partial`.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: Consider adding unit tests to ensure new attributes (`partial_args` and `partial_kwargs`) are correctly handled under different scenarios, for comprehensive validation.\n\nIt appears that the patch properly fixes the described issue by correctly displaying `functools.partial` functions in the `__repr__` method.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score**:\n<score>8</score>"

When a `functools.partial` function is used as a view, its `__repr__` output is not helpful as it only shows `functools.partial` without revealing the underlying function or the pre-provided arguments. The suggested fix is to unwrap `functools.partial` objects in the `ResolverMatch.__init__` method to allow more informative representation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- ResolverMatch\n- ResolverMatch.__init__\n- URLPattern.lookup_str\n- ResolverMatch.__repr__\n\n1. `ResolverMatch class (span id=ResolverMatch)`:\n   This is the class where the `__init__` and `__repr__` methods are located, hence, it's where the root cause and eventually solution will be applied.\n\n2. `ResolverMatch.__init__ (span id=ResolverMatch.__init__)`:\n   This is the constructor method where changes are suggested to be made, to unwrap `functools.partial` objects when they are encountered.\n\n3. `URLPattern.lookup_str`:\n   This method demonstrated a pattern for handling `functools.partial` objects by unwrapping them. This pattern can offer crucial insight on how to implement a similar unwrapping in `ResolverMatch.__init__`.\n\n4. `ResolverMatch.__repr__ (span id=ResolverMatch.__repr__)`:\n   This is the `__repr__` method that is being modified to give a better view of the function, including its partial arguments.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunks:\n1. Modified Hunk 1 in `__init__` method:\n```python\n33:     def __init__(self, func, args, kwargs, url_name=None, app_names=None, namespaces=None, route=None, tried=None):\n34:         if isinstance(func, functools.partial):\n35:             # Unwrap functools.partial objects.\n36:             args = func.args + tuple(args)\n37:             partial_kwargs = func.keywords or {}\n38:             kwargs = {**partial_kwargs, **kwargs}\n39:             func = func.func\n40:         self.func = func\n41:         self.args = args\n42:         self.kwargs = kwargs\n43:         self.url_name = url_name\n44:         self.route = route\n45:         self.tried = tried\n```\nExplanation: This hunk unwrapped `functools.partial` arguments if `func` is an instance of `functools.partial`. It combines the partial function's arguments with those passed at the time of initialization and merges its keywords with `kwargs`.\n\n2. Modified Hunk 2 in `__repr__` method:\n```python\n67:     def __repr__(self):\n68:         return \"ResolverMatch(func=%s, args=%s, kwargs=%s, url_name=%s, app_names=%s, namespaces=%s, route=%s)\" % (\n69:             self._func_path,\n70:             self.args,\n71:             self.kwargs,\n72:             self.url_name,\n73:             self.app_names,\n74:             self.namespaces,\n75:             self.route,\n76:         )\n```\nExplanation: This part ensures that the representation string uses `self._func_path`, `self.args`, and `self.kwargs` accurately, without redundancy.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The changes are made to `ResolverMatch.__init__` to handle unwrapping `functools.partial` objects and adjusting `__repr__` appropriately.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch mostly aligns well with the identified code spans. The one concern here is the `__repr__` modification, where previously self._func_path was printed as func, notably losing information that might have complexified reading. But there aren\u2019t new contradictions, mistreat features, nor result in inconsistencies.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue of providing more detail in `__repr__` related to partial functions. However, it partially falls in fixing the issue accurately on `__repr__`.\n1. Repetitive Code: Not introduced.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The API usage is semantically and syntactically correct.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Proper and thorough thought was given, for instance having partial `kwargs`. However, inaccurate multiple times \"self.func\" occurred rather than distinct necessary detail there (URL one formatting may overlook also needed corrections).\nThere seem trifles inaccuracies around finer `.funcname` functionalities adapting more granuly afterward but significant transparency established exhaustive plus increasing soundness towards very aligned fixing no fallacies happen primarily.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"
