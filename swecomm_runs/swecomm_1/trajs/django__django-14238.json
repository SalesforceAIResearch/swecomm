BigAutoField: Another subclass of AutoField where the changes should ensure its subclasses are accounted for.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Inserting `_cached_subclasses = None`: This introduces a cache to avoid recomputation of all the subclasses.\n2. Updating the `_subclasses` property: The method is modified to compute all subclasses dynamically, including nested subclasses using the recursive `get_all_subclasses` function. Also, it concatenates the results with `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n3.

However, multiple definitions of `_cached_subclasses` should be corrected by removing the duplicate. That aside, the logic itself seems cohesive and aligns with the changes suggested in the issue description.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by ensuring that subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are recognized as valid auto fields. It solves the concern by determining all the subclasses of `AutoField` dynamically and updating the `__subclasscheck__` method accordingly.\n\nExamined against common LLM mistakes:\n1. Repetitive code: Did not detect repetition but noticed `._cached_subclasses = None` twice.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The `__subclasscheck__` implementation now correctly uses `issubclass`.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: The edge case of nested subclasses seems covered with recursive methods to fetch all subclasses.\n\nThus, the patch should work correctly, though it has redundancy with `_cached_subclasses` duplicate.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

This is relevant because the patch has to recognize subclasses like `SmallAutoField` for `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` validation.\n\n3. **AutoFieldMeta**:\n   - The metaclass for `AutoField`, which includes logic for backward compatibility and subclass checking. Relevant because the changes must be applied here to fix the subclass validation issue.\n\n4. **AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__**:\n   - This method checks if a class is a recognized subclass of `AutoField`. It's relevant as this logic needs updating to accommodate recursive subclass checking for custom auto fields.\n\n5. **AutoFieldMeta._subclasses**:\n   - Property method returning a tuple of directly recognized subclasses. Relevant as the tuple needs to include recursively all subclasses of `AutoField`.\n\n6. **BigAutoField**:\n   - Represents another specific subclass of `AutoField`. Like with `SmallAutoField`, the solution must ensure the patch recognizes all related subclasses.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

It updates the `_subclasses` property to include a recursive method to retrieve all subclasses of `AutoField`. It also ensures `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are added to this list.\n\n2. **AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__**:\n   - Updates the `__subclasscheck__` method to check if a subclass is any subclass (recursively) of known `_subclasses` instead of directly in `_subclasses`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `AutoFieldMeta` metaclass functions `_subclasses` and `__subclasscheck__`, which are directly responsible for resolving the subclass check issue with custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues. It remains consistent with the objective to dynamically recognize subclasses through a recursive fetching mechanism. This consistent return between old and new methods with the needed extension in function and precision avoids breaches or new bugs.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the issue:\n\n1. **Repetitive code**: No repetitive code is present in the modification.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Uses correct Python/django mechanisms for recursive subclass fetching and internal state handling via `__class__` level caching.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: Sufficient edge cases include subclasses added to improve API usage across dynamic hierarchical relationships. Adding custom-defined `MyBigAutoField` and `MySmallAutoField` will avoid triggering the primary error with checking increments that cover scenarios fully aligned with patch changes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the issue\nThe issue is that Django causes a crash when setting `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to a custom AutoField subclass (like `MyBigAutoField`) which extends `BigAutoField`. The error occurs because the custom class is not recognized as a subclass of `AutoField`. To fix this, it is suggested to modify the `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` method to correctly handle subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` in its `_subclasses` property.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves Django crashing due to its inability to recognize custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as valid subclasses of `AutoField` when `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is set to one of these custom classes.

                    "msg": "Let's review the issue and the corresponding details provided:\n\n### Understanding the Issue:\n\n1. **Issue Description:**\n   - `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is set to a custom subclass of `BigAutoField`.\n   - Django throws a `ValueError` stating that the primary key referred by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`.\n   - The proposed fix is to modify `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` to allow subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that Django's `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting fails when using a subclass of `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField` as the default. The error occurs because Django requires that the primary key referred by `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` must subclass `AutoField`, but the check does not accommodate subclasses of `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Relevant Code Spans:\n\n1. **List of Span IDs:**\n   - `AutoFieldMeta.__instancecheck__`\n   - `SmallAutoField`\n   - `AutoFieldMeta`\n   - `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__`\n   - `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses`\n   - `BigAutoField`\n\n2. **Explanation of Code Spans:**\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `AutoFieldMeta.__instancecheck__`: The method that checks whether an instance is of type `AutoField` or its `_subclasses`.\n- `SmallAutoField`: Class that implements `SmallIntegerField` for automatically-generated fields.\n- `AutoFieldMeta`: The metaclass designed for maintaining inheritance compatibility for `AutoField`.\n- `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__`: The method that checks whether a subclass is part of `_subclasses` or inherits from it.\n- `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses`: Property listing subclasses `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n- `BigAutoField`: Class that implements `BigIntegerField` for automatically-generated fields.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch:\n\n1. **List of Modified Hunks:**\n\n- Lines 2520 to 2524 in `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses`.\n- Moving the check mechanism for handling all subclasses dynamically.\n\n2. **Explanation of Hunks:**\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `_subclasses` property method to add all direct subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`, allowing the metaclass to dynamically handle custom subclasses. The `__subclasscheck__` and `__instancecheck__` methods remain the same.\n- The modified `_subclasses` now includes tuples of all subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Fixing the Correct Function Check:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. It modifies the logic in the `AutoFieldMeta` class, which is responsible for subclass checks of `AutoField`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introduction of New Issues:\n\n1. No drift or contradictions were found with the existing code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and aligns with the existing code structure. It enhances the `_subclasses` property to dynamically include subclasses, ensuring that custom fields are considered valid.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Fix Effectiveness:\n\n1. **Repetitive Code:**\n   - No repetitive code is introduced.\n\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:**\n   - The updated logic appropriately uses Python's subclass checking mechanism.\n\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases:**\n   - The edge case of additional levels of subclassing is now covered.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by modifying the `_subclasses` property to include custom subclasses dynamically. It avoids repetitive code and uses correct API usage. It does not overlook edge cases and ensures all subclasses are taken into consideration.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring:\n\nBased on the rubric, considering that there are no contradictions, no new issues, and the patch effectively fixes the problem:\n\n<score>10</score>"
