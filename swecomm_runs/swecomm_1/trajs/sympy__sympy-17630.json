BlockMatrix\n4. block_collapse\n5. ZeroMatrix\n   \n1. bc_matmul: This function is involved in matrix multiplications, and within it, the multiplication of `BlockMatrix` objects is handled. It directly calls the `_blockmul` method, making it relevant to how block multiplication is performed and potentially causing the error.\n\n2. BlockMatrix._blockmul: This is a key function for handling block-wise multiplication within a `BlockMatrix`. Any bug in handling zero blocks during the multiplication within this method would be directly relevant to the issue at hand.\n\n3. BlockMatrix: This class defines the `BlockMatrix` construct, including how its properties and methods should behave. Fixes for ensuring that `Zero` blocks behave correctly as `ZeroMatrix` blocks need to interact correctly within this class.\n\n4. block_collapse: This utility function deals with optimizing or collapsing block matrices. Ensuring it correctly identifies and handles zero blocks can be part of resolving the issue.\n\n5. ZeroMatrix: This class represents the `ZeroMatrix` construct in SymPy. Transforming a `Zero` type that appears during multiplication into a proper `ZeroMatrix` ensures that operations like `.cols` access behave as expected during nested multiplications.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modification in blockmatrix.py from line 147 to 185: \n   - Modifies the `colblocksizes` method to check if blocks are of type `MatrixExpr`; otherwise, return the appropriate column block size.\n   - The updated `_blockmul` method now builds each resulting block in a nested loop and replaces zero-product terms acknowledged as `ZeroMatrix`.\n\n2. Modification in blockmatrix.py from line 380 to 411:\n   - Adds a utility function `convert_zero_to_zeromatrix` that converts any instance of `Zero` to a `ZeroMatrix`.\n   - Integrates this utility function into `conditioned_rl` used within the `block_collapse` method to ensure `Zero` entities are properly treated.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch fixes the relevant functions and locations where the block matrix module processes individual matrix blocks and general block matrix manipulations, including in the `_blockmul` method. These seem to be valid changes addressing the areas raising the issue during matrix multiplication and collapsing.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any obvious new issues, as it corrects nearing all interactions to treat `Zero` formally as `ZeroMatrix` within context. However, ensuring the wider existing functionalities handle this transformation requires broader tests within the matrix package. Generally, transforming `Zero` object straightforwardly to `ZeroMatrix` in nested multiplication contexts ensures the calculations recognize necessary dimensions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe applied patch correctly addresses multiple essential facets of the issue:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The code modification avoids repetitive logic within `blockmul` and centralizes zero handling in `_blockmul`, improving function cohesiveness.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: The patch guards against the misuse by standardizing matrix entities more formally.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The patch integrally generates safe interaction when dealing with potential zero blocks in nested `BlockMatrix` repeated multiplications by recognizing initially blocks encountered as `Zero`.\n\nNotably, this safeguards against specific exception points verified within identified spans without side traction; this solution design spontaneously aligns and consistently addresses raising error ensuring zero block handled as `ZeroMatrix`, permitting safe handling.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understanding the Issue:**\n\nThe reported issue occurs when trying to multiply block matrices in SymPy, particularly BlockMatrix instances that include ZeroMatrix blocks. The multiplications work fine until multiple multiplications are performed. The error seems to arise because ZeroMatrix blocks are converted to Zero objects, which lack the `cols` attribute, resulting in an AttributeError.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue arises when performing multiple multiplications with BlockMatrix instances in SymPy that consist of ZeroMatrix blocks. After one multiplication, the ZeroMatrix blocks are converted to Zero objects, which causes an AttributeError due to the missing `cols` attribute.\n</issue_exp>\n\n**2. Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- `bc_matmul`: Relevant to how block matrix multiplication is handled.

The problematic conversion of ZeroMatrix to Zero likely occurs here.\n- `BlockMatrix`: Provides context on how BlockMatrix is defined and used.\n- `block_collapse`: Shows how expressions involving block matrices are evaluated and conditioned.

This should handle additive identity rules efficiently but contains unwarranted repetition.\n- In `blockmatrix.py`, the patch modifies `_blockmul` method by adding a nested loop checking matrix block entries. This ensures zeros in the block are converted to ZeroMatrix objects, addressing the AttributeError for embedded Zero objects.\n</patch_exp>\n\n**4.
