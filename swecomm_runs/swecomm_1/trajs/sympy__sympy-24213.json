Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function.

Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nAnalyzing the use of `get_dimensional_dependencies` helps fix equivalent dimensions by comparing their dependencies rather than their direct dimensional objects, thus addressing the core issue. However, if the code further uses direct comparisons elsewhere that also require dependency checks (though not identified in the provided span), similar adjustments would be needed throughout the codebase. This immediate patch seems to solve the prescribed issue without repetitive code or incorrect API usage.\nOne minor aspect to check would be that `get_dimensional_dependencies(dim) == get_dimensional_dependencies(addend_dim)` is a sufficiently accurate measure for dimensional equivalence issues and that these assignments internally worked as intended to deliver the correct structural format. As per review, these checks return appropriate analogous structuring, conveying a well-framed solution retaining comprehensibility.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>\n"

This causes a `ValueError` when trying to add quantities with equivalent dimensional dependencies but not direct dimensional identity. Specifically, this error occurs when trying to add quantum quantities such as velocity, acceleration, and time.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\nList of span ids:\n- UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**: This function is central to the issue, as it processes different mathematical expressions (e.g., `Add`, `Mul`, `Pow`, etc.) to return tuples containing scale factors and dimension expressions. It consists of specific branches for different expression types and includes logic to compare dimensions of quantities.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- From line 175 in `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`\n- To line 185 in `sympy/physics/units/unitsystem.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Modified Hunk**: The patch adds logic to handle dimensional dependencies of dimensions instead of comparing the dimensions directly. This change equips the function to handle expressions with dimensions that are equivalent in terms of dependencies. It accomplishes this by examining both `dim` and `addend_dim` for their dimensional dependencies with `get_dimensional_dependencies`. If these dependencies match, the code proceeds as if the dimensions themselves were equivalent. If they do not, the patch raises a `ValueError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch makes a modification to the `_collect_factor_and_dimension` function, which is indeed the correct location since it directly handles dimension collection and comparison for different types of mathematical expressions involving quantities. This includes expressions like `Add` where the error originates in the issue description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues or contradict the identified code spans.

This targets the root cause directly. \n- **Avoiding Repetitive Code**: The patch does not introduce unnecessary or repetitive code, it enhances existing logic.\n- **correct API Usage**: The usage of `get_dimensional_dependencies` is proper and logical within context.\n- **Considering Edge Cases**: The patch specifically addresses situations where dimensional equivalence is required but not simple equality.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the issue\nThe code appears to fail when trying to add velocity (`v1`) and acceleration multiplied by time (`a1 * t1`). The expected behavior is for the function to detect that the dimensions represented by these quantities are ultimately equivalent. The function currently does not account for this equivalence and subsequently raises a `ValueError`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the function `collect_factor_and_dimension` does not detect dimensions that are essentially equivalent when adding quantities, resulting in a `ValueError` when trying to add expressions like velocity and acceleration multiplied by time.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the identified code spans\nWe have a single relevant code span to examine and consider.\n\nIdentified Span:\n- `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`\n\n#### Explanation of Relevance:\n- **UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension**: Contains the main logic for traversing symbolic expressions and collecting dimension-related information. The logic within the `Add` case (from lines 173 to 184) appears to handle addition operations, which is directly relevant to the reported issue regarding the addition of quantities having related dimensions.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nIdentified span IDs: \n- UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension\n\nRelevance:\n- `UnitSystem._collect_factor_and_dimension`: Contains the logic for summing dimensions in expressions and assures compatibility. The issue manifests due to its current simplistic dimensionality check, where dimensional equivalences are not detected properly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the candidate patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks:\n- Modification around the handling of `Add` instances within `collect_factor_and_dimension`.\n\nExplanation:\n- The original code directly compares dimensions (`dim` and `addend_dim`) for equality.\n- The patched code computes the dimensional dependencies using `get_dimensional_dependencies` and compares these dependencies instead.\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunks:\n1. Modifies handling of `Add` expressions in `collect_factor_and_dimension`.\n    - Instead of directly comparing dimensions, it uses `get_dimensional_dependencies` to compare the dependencies.\n\nHunk is doing:\nThe modification allows the function to check if dimensions have equivalent dependencies rather than exact equality. This helps in addressing the scenario where different forms of equivalent dimensions need to be recognized as compatible.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function, `collect_factor_and_dimension`. This function processes expressions and symbolically analyses their associated dimensions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears to enhance the dimensionality check without introducing contradictions with the identified code span. It simply adds a more nuanced comparison using dimensional dependencies.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n#### Compare against commonly made LLM mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: The patch does not introduce repetitive calculations. It remains concise.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The LLM correctly utilizes `get_dimensional_dependencies`, which is appropriate for the problem.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The patch solidly handles the reported scenario by encompassing the logic for dimensional dependencies, thus covering additional edge cases involving dimensionally equivalent units.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the raised issue by employing a method to compare dimensional dependencies rather than direct dimension equality. This should resolve the interoperability of dimensions like velocity and acceleration*time, ensuring equivalents are properly detected.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Score\nKeeping in mind the above considerations and noting that no newly introduced issues are evident, we can conclude the patch is effective and appropriately handled the problem.\n\n<score>10</score>"
