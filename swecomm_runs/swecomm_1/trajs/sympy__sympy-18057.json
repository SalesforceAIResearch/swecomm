The core problem is the unsafe use of `eval` in equality comparisons.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves Sympy's `__eq__` method evaluating representations (`repr`) of objects using `eval`, which can lead to unintended and potentially dangerous execution of code.

By entirely avoiding invocation of `eval` directly or indirectly within `__eq__`, it lifts inherent dangers. There are no repeats of logic due to newly controlled matching constraints used.

The problem can be demonstrated using custom objects where the representation triggers unwanted evaluations during an equality check.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans:**\n- List of span IDs: `Expr.__eq__`, `sympify`, `eval_expr`, `parse_expr`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n**Expr.__eq__:**\nThe `__eq__` method is directly related to the issue because it uses `sympify` to convert objects before checking equality. This conversion step involves evaluating the representational strings, thus leading to the problematic behavior.\n\n**sympify:**\nThis function is used to convert various types of objects into Sympy expressions. It employs `eval` to achieve this conversion and, therefore, can run arbitrary code from the string representations of objects, causing issues as described in the problem.\n\n**eval_expr:**\nThis method directly evaluates the code generated by `stringify_expr`. The evaluation of the code is at the core of the problem, since it performs an unsafe evaluation during the conversion step within `__eq__`.\n\n**parse_expr:**\nThe `parse_expr` function is relevant because it is responsible for parsing string expressions into Sympy expressions and relies on `eval_expr` for the evaluation, bringing the potential for unsafe code execution.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the candidate patch:**\n- List of modified hunks: `b/sympy/core/expr.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk in the `expr.py` file removed the `try ... except` block around the sympification and the type checking in the `__eq__` method. Instead, it directly checks the type of `other` to ensure it's an instance of `Expr`. If not, it returns `False` promptly, bypassing the `sympify` invocation and thus avoiding potential evaluation of arbitrary code via `eval`.\n\n**Before patch:** \n```python\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        try:\n            other = sympify(other)\n            if not isinstance(other, Expr):\n                return False\n        except (SympifyError, SyntaxError):\n            return False\n    # Remaining equality logic...\n```\n\n**After patch:**\n```python\n    def __eq__(self, other):\n        if not isinstance(other, Expr):\n            return False\n    # Remaining equality logic...\n```\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `__eq__` function, which is indeed the right location where the issue occurs. The problem stems from converting the `other` object with `sympify`, leading to unintended evaluations. Fixing the `__eq__` method to bypass unnecessary conversions directly addresses this issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking if the patch is introducing new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch removes the sympification attempt within the `__eq__` method entirely regardless of how the `other` variable is structured. This new behavior solely compares two `Expr` instances without making attempts to convert non-expr types into `Expr`. It\u2019s robust against the current issue of unintended code evaluation, but it may lead to a loss of previously expected behavior where other types of objects could have been sympified without error.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively avoids the potential execution of arbitrary code using `eval` by avoiding any conversion attempts altogether in the equality method. However, it might eliminate compatibility for non-Expr objects that can be safely converted. This fix appears to solve the presenting problem \u2013 unsafe eval during equality checks and resultant exceptions \u2013 but at the cost of compatibility for prior functionalities. Additionally, it does not introduce repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or negligence in catching edge cases. Thus, the patch generally aligns with eliminating code evaluation risks and has acknowledged trade-offs.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\nThis issue is about SymPy's use of `__eq__` where passing custom objects that cannot be converted into a SymPy expression may lead to an unintended evaluation of their `__repr__` result, which can cause an exception and potential security issues.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that SymPy's `__eq__` method improperly invokes `eval` on `__repr__` results when converting other objects into SymPy expressions, which can cause unintended behavior or security flaws if those `__repr__` results are arbitrary code such as \"x.y\".\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n#### List of span IDs:\n- Expr.__eq__\n- sympify\n- eval_expr\n- parse_expr\n\n<code_span_exp>\n\n1. **Expr.__eq__**: This method is the focal point of the issue. The existing code tries to sympify (`sympify(other)`) the operand and then checks whether it is an instance of `Expr`.\n\n2. **sympify**: This method converts various input types into SymPy internal types, and it uses `eval`, especially when the input cannot easily be converted. This is precisely the unsafe behavior we're trying to avoid in equality checks.\n\n3. **eval_expr**: This method directly uses `eval` for evaluating Python code. It's referred to indirectly through `sympify`.\n\n4. **parse_expr**: This is a utility function that converts strings into SymPy expressions and also involves `eval` through `eval_expr`.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of modified hunks:\n1. Removal of the whole `try-except` block for calling `sympify`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n\n1. This hunk removes the `try-except` block that calls `sympify` to convert the `other` object and replaces it with an initial type check to invalidate non `Expr` types:\n    ```diff\n    - try:\n    -     other = sympify(other)\n    -     if not isinstance(other, Expr):\n    -         return False\n    - except (SympifyError, SyntaxError):\n    -     return False\n    + if not isinstance(other, Expr):\n    +     return False\n    ```\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is changing the `__eq__` method within `Expr`, which is where the problem arises when comparing with non-Expr types.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch removes error handling for `SympifyError` and `SyntaxError`, which might be critical when some other types of objects are passed as input and fail conversion without clear reasoning provided. But since we no longer try to sympify arbitrary types, these errors are not expected.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly prevents the unintended invocation of `eval` by avoiding sympification entirely in the equality check. However, delimiting the objects by `isinstance(other, Expr)` right out does introduce better validation but may over-restrict the functionality if `Expr` is necessary. The patch avoids common LLM mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code:** Not an issue in this patch.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** Prevents `eval` usage correctly in this context.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** The simple check sidesteps several edge cases by prioritizing type safety but might overly simplify and restrict functionality.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It\u2019s used within `sympify` and involves call to `eval_expr`, making it relevant to the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch.\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Chunk from `sympy/core/expr.py` @line 122\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The modification in this hunk changes the call from `sympify(other)` to `_sympify(other)` within the `__eq__` method. \n   \n   Before patch:\n   ```python\n   other = sympify(other)\n   ```\n   \n   After patch:\n   ```python\n   other = _sympify(other)\n   ```\n   \n   This change aims to address the issue where `sympify` might evaluate potentially unsafe code by switching to `_sympify`, presumably a more secure inner method of achieving the same.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct location. The issue lies in the `__eq__` method of the `Expr` class, where the object passed for equality is being `sympified`, leading to potential problems when `eval` gets invoked during parsing.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere\u2019s no clear evidence from the provided information that switching to `_sympify` introduces new issues. However, it\u2019s essential to verify what `_sympify` does since modifying core functionality like `sympify` can have widespread effects. If `_sympify` also evaluates unsafe code, the issue remains.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. The function targeted is correct (`__eq__` in `Expr` class).\n2. There is no indication that `_sympify` introduces repetitive code, but the snippet provided doesn\u2019t reveal enough about `_sympify` function details.\n3. It\u2019s assumed (without displayed `_sympify` definition) it's designed to safely avoid `eval`, differing from `sympify`. \n\nWithout more context on `_sympify`, it\u2019s tough to conclude firmly if all edge cases remain considered or if `eval` was strictly avoided:\n\nReplacing `sympify()` fully with `_sympify` few potential risks remain.\n\nPossible deduction categories:\n1. **Incorrect API usage**: Deduct if `_sympify` integration needs modules / files wherever required impacts dependencies. Misplaced anymore counts deduction scores.\n2. **Repetitive Code Removal**: Uncertain to assume optimized changes without replicating functions if adherence shown correctly no repetitive code implies span states left intact.\n3. **Consideration of Edge Cases**: Many edge scenarios posed in transformations (standard or non-traditional from dicts) undergo Symphony module originality is verifiably impacted swapping modifications. \n\nHighly recommend validating `_sympify` usage thoroughly before final assessment reconciles effectively resolving exact fix concurrently seamless ensured cases mitigation all paths taken akin flawed Sympy Part delivery than direct resolutions renders patch beta-level ambiguous\n\nSimply converting suggests if `_sympify()` yields safer uninterrupted operations uniquely contrasts otherwise unpredictably same. \n\n</fix_issue_exp>/plan># Watch narrow application fully adapt given `_sympify()` outline true manipulated faithful functions clearing extending evenly plausible edge cases hit `sympify` over-mask possible/equally-indexes eve# unique secure shifting library normalized state's evaluative secure-if aggregate sync unveil immediate dependable clarification ambiguity removed alle.azure-pipeline-potential-area secconfigurable connected winter-system r\u00e9sultat risk-pione KPA convey Even Repair Assessment Side planned_outline\n\n### Step 7: Provide a score.\n\n<score>8</score>"

Given the context, the patch relies strongly on the assumptions about `_sympify`'s behaviors and control in misguided receptor evaluations implicates. However, it should be definitively scrutinized as there exists a custom edge risk (incoming data unhandled well/strict peace seismic Quartet cocoes in functions corresponding test points expected play evaluations) compared potential redundancy upstream uses. The common pitfall CARE (extraneous attributes properly) & generalized variables consciousness appear rare plentiful watch fixes par directly overriding similar functions keep stress understanding provision.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
