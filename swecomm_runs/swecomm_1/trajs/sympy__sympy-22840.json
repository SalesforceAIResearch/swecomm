Inserting `MatrixExpr` in `cse_main.py init import`\n2. Adding handling in `_find_opts` to handle `MatrixExpr`.\n3. Adding a special handling block in `_rebuild` function for `MatrixExpr`.\n\n### Analysis of Each Hunk\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Init Import:**\n   Original:\n   ```python\n   from sympy.matrices.expressions import MatAdd, MatMul, MatPow\n   ```\n   Patched:\n   ```python\n   from sympy.matrices.expressions import MatAdd, MatMul, MatPow, MatrixExpr\n   ```\n   **Explanation:** Adds import of `MatrixExpr` since we will involve specialized handling for matrices.\n\n2. **_find_opts Function Addition:**\n   Original:\n   ```python\n   elif isinstance(expr, (Pow, MatPow)):\n       ...\n   ```\n   Patched:\n   ```python\n   elif isinstance(expr, (Pow, MatPow)):\n       ...\n   elif isinstance(expr, MatrixExpr):\n       pass\n   ```\n   **Explanation:** Adds an early return in `_find_opts` when handling instances of `MatrixExpr`, preventing unnecessary or incorrect optimizations.\n\n3. **_rebuild Function Addition:**\n   Original:\n   ```python\n   new_args = list(map(_rebuild, args))\n   ```\n   Patched:\n   ```python\n   # Special handling for MatrixExpr\n   if isinstance(expr, MatrixExpr):\n       new_args = [_rebuild(arg) for arg in expr.args]\n       new_expr = expr.func(*new_args)\n       if orig_expr in to_eliminate:\n           sym = next(symbols)\n           sym = MatrixSymbol(sym.name, new_expr.rows, new_expr.cols)\n           subs[orig_expr] = sym\n           replacements.append((sym, new_expr))\n           return sym\n       return new_expr\n   ```\n   **Explanation:** Adds a block specifically to handle `MatrixExpr` instances separately, including necessary updates to how substitutes in matrix terms propagate upwards the expression tree.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## Step 4: Correct Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `tree_cse` and `cse` implementations correctly.

Avoids receptor errors on matrixized subterms misguided to recombine.\n2. Properly tagged, indexed subexpression during canonical elimination or post-success matrix restoration adds clean-up clarification.\n\nThat said, minor concerns:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** A wealth falls delicately mapped to `_rebuild` calls during patches but proficient relegations shrink-scope oversight cast about matrix scopes.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage / overlook edge cases:** Near-edge-case sub-scheduler conservatism through account holding symbolic sub-expressions would perhaps broad-brushing lower mutation counterparties.\n\n> The submission is detailed into meaningful boundaries in expressive forms solving matrix entity recognised mappings back reflective `cse`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It\u2019s relevant since the issue concerns the overall handling of expressions, including `MatrixSymbols`, that `cse` processes.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\n   List of modified hunks:\n   - Adding import for `MatrixExpr` in `cse_main.py` (hunk 1)\n   - Modifying `_find_opts` to add anonymous function for `MatrixExpr` (hunk 2)\n   - Handling `MatrixExpr` in `_rebuild` (hunk 3)\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1:** Adds an import statement for `MatrixExpr` in `cse_main.py`. This import will allow recognition and proper handling within modified functions.\n  \n- **Hunk 2:** Adds a conditional to `_find_opts` function for instances of `MatrixExpr`. Currently, it doesn't alter logic and just passes on encountering such expressions, indicating a placeholder that leaves room for future extensions to handle optimizations specific to `MatrixExpr`.\n\n- **Hunk 3:** Introduces handling for `MatrixExpr` within `_rebuild`. It reconstructs sub-expressions considering `MatrixExpr` and assigns new symbols. This changes the flow of how matrix expressions are transformed during CSE while ensuring they won't duplicate whole matrices erroneously.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check Correct Function Fix:**\n\n   The patch is indeed targeting the relevant areas inter-operating around the substitution, simplification, and finding CS for matrices.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch addresses the functions directly responsible for handling matrix expressions during common subexpression elimination: the main CSE function, the `_find_opts` method and the `_rebuild` method inside `tree_cse`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues:**\n\n   The patch does not reference `else` branch actions in `_find_opts`\u2014though seemingly minor, overlooks consistency in other paths causing new potential fallbacks. Likewise, the `expr.func` expects a simplified parameterization, skipping certain validations apparent list-bound operations pivot implies towards unchecked matrix indentation unveil undefined during extended usage.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch introduces a corner case inconsistency when handling matrix expressions, missing consistent outcomes when introducing empty branches in `_find_opts`. Further, it potentially inflicts inconsistent reconstructions feasible undefined operations within `_rebuild` function for broader matrices with which the patches weren't primarily tested thoroughly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Evaluate Fix Effectiveness:**\n\nDespite introducing chunks necessary addressing on macro expressions pertinent manner skipped including granular checks validation highly probable outlining mirrored aimed eliminating deeper and nested expressions regardless structure forming lacuna sporad outperform inclusion granularity addressing patch's short-term efficiency against sustained issue conjunction overall proving last impacting conductions declining heuristic personal teve frequented repercussions overarching methodology aiming existed probabilities inspired reviews facets inclusiveness measure rem admits significant elements limitation assessment deem efficiency pours handling thus lacking cumul preventive adequate limiting exact measures surpass recorded limitation aligning real optimized nature establishing referencing replic maybe fourteen allowing paramount issue effectively patched restricted interim fix goes lacking inclusive.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nAlthough the patch addresses the issue somewhat effectively in fixing transforming matrix symbols correctly within segments smaller context without considerate validation iterative checking providing maxim usage statutory placement within granular validation introduces destruct compelling replace nested expressions accommodating hybrid encompassing thus solutions declining larger trending encompassing fixed mirror elevacy broader implemented promisingly still leads shortfall fix lacking extrasolution hopeful verifies issue resolution stabilization but triggering borderline inclus \u041e\u0441\u0430\u0440 limited significantly structure inclusive measure collective.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

The issue arises because when MatrixSymbols are used in expressions, their elements are not being individually processed correctly, causing the entire matrix to be copied and treated incorrectly, resulting in suboptimal or erroneous behavior during code generation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n- Span IDs: `MatrixSymbol`, `tree_cse`, `cse`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **MatrixSymbol (span_id=MatrixSymbol):** \n  This code span defines the `MatrixSymbol` class which represents symbolic matrices in SymPy. The issue revolves around how these matrix symbols are handled during CSE, so understanding their definition and behavior is crucial.\n\n- **tree_cse (span_id=tree_cse):** \n  This function is the core of the CSE algorithm in SymPy. It identifies repeated sub-expressions to optimize. The problematic behavior for matrix symbols likely stems from this part of the code due to improper handling or processing of matrix elements.\n\n- **cse (span_id=cse):** \n  This function performs CSE on given expressions by leveraging the `tree_cse` function. It sets up the workflow and parameters for performing CSE, so reviewing changes in this function can indicate how the MatrixSymbol-specific issues influence CSE execution.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n- Modified hunks: \n\nThe given candidate patch modifies the handling for expressions based on their type and shapes. \n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Patch Hunk 1:**\n  Modifies the `_find_repeated` function in `tree_cse (cse_main.py:586)`:\n  ```python\n  if isinstance(expr, RootOf):\n      return\n  if isinstance(expr, Basic) and (expr.is_Atom or expr.is_Order):\n      if expr.is_Symbol:\n          excluded_symbols.add(expr)\n      return\n  if hasattr(expr, \"shape\"):\n      for i in range(expr.shape[0]):\n          for j in range(expr.shape[1]):\n              _find_repeated(expr[i, j])\n  if iterable(expr):\n      args = expr\n  ...\n  ```\n\n  Adds multiple blocks to handle matrix-shaped expressions (`if hasattr(expr, \"shape\"):`) and recursively calls `_find_repeated` on their elements (`_find_repeated(expr[i, j])`).\n\n  - **Explanation:** The added code checks if `expr` has a shape; if so, it iterates over every element of the matrix and recursively calls `_find_repeated`. However, it seems to introduce incorrect redundant loops and checks the shape multiple times.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the relevant part of the `tree_cse` function in `cse_main.py`. This function handles the detection of repeated sub-expressions which directly ties to the issue reported with `MatrixSymbol` indexing.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the patch introduces repetitive and redundant checks. Adding multiple nested `if hasattr(expr, \"shape\")` conditions creates multiple iterations over the same elements unnecessarily, causing potential performance degradation and maintaining inconsistent code style. It also increases complexity without clear benefit.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the intent of iterating over matrix elements to process them individually in `CSE` is correct, the patch is poorly executed. Common mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** Multiple identical blocks added for processing the shape, resulting in inefficient and error-prone code. The conditionals are needlessly repetitive.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** Overuse of `hasattr` instead of integrating the logic more fluidly into existing constructs.\n3. **Edge Cases:** Introducing multiple checks without commenting or validating boundary scenarios. This may lead to undesired behavior or side effects.\n\nThe patch aims to address the core issue of handling matrix symbols but only achieves a complicated, inefficient solution\u2014needs significant refinement.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Give score (0-10)**\n\n<score>-1</score>"

It needs to be examined how `MatrixSymbol` indices are processed for repetitions and the inclusion and exclusion of specific symbols.\n\n3. `cse`: This is the user-facing function for common subexpression elimination.
