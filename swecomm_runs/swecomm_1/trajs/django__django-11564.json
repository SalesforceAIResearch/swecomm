Currently, the frameworks and utility functions in Django directly use STATIC_URL, which leads to incorrect URLs when the application is not running at the root path. This issue extends both to Django's default static tag as well as to django.contrib.staticfiles.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n<span_ids>\nStaticFilesHandlerMixin, StaticFilesStorage, StaticFilesStorage.__init__, FileSystemStorage.url, FileSystemStorage, static, media, PrefixNode, StaticNode.render, StaticNode, StaticNode.handle_simple\n</span_ids>\n<StaticFilesHandlerMixin>\nThis span indicates that the StaticFilesHandlerMixin class is part of handling static files and may be involved in generating URLs for these files when the application is running.\n</StaticFilesHandlerMixin>\n<StaticFilesStorage>\nThe StaticFilesStorage class is the default filesystem storage for static files, controlling how URLs for static files are generated and managed.\n</StaticFilesStorage>\n<StaticFilesStorage.__init__>\nThe __init__ method in StaticFilesStorage sets the default values for location and base_url, which are tied to STATIC_ROOT and STATIC_URL. The handling of both paths is crucial to the issue since STATIC_URL doesn't accommodate SCRIPT_NAME.\n</StaticFilesStorage.__init__>\n<FileSystemStorage.url>\nThis method in FileSystemStorage generates URLs for static files. It's the best place where SCRIPT_NAME can be injected into the static file URL so generated.\n</FileSystemStorage.url>\n<FileSystemStorage>\nThis class serves when a standard file system storage requires integration with the media or static files. Since media paths also need to respect SCRIPT_NAME, changes to this class are relevant.\n</FileSystemStorage>\n<static>\nThe static function makes STATIC_URL available in the context for templates. It needs enhancements to accommodate SCRIPT_NAME.\n</static>\n<media>\nThe media function does a similar job for MEDIA_URL, requiring similar enhancements to the `static` function.\n</media>\n<PrefixNode>\nPrefixNode class inspects and plugs in prefixes, deeply tied to how URL paths can be prefixed.\n</PrefixNode>\n<StaticNode.render>\nDisplays the role of the StaticNode class for generating static file URLs in actual use.\n</StaticNode.render>\n<StaticNode>\nDetails StaticNode renders the static URL and provides it for templates. Enhancements to this class can impact templates using STATIC_URL.\n</StaticNode>\n<StaticNode.handle_simple>\nWorks hand-in-hand with StaticNode; main part depicts how templates regardless of settings correctly manage URLs.\n</StaticNode.handle_simple>\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<hunks>\nhunk_1: django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py\nhunk_2: django/core/files/storage.py: large repetition block\nhunk_3: django/core/files/storage.py modification at line 221\n</hunks>\n<hunk_1>\nThis hunk imports `get_script_prefix` from `django.urls` in `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py`.

The Script should prepend SCRIPT_NAME to these URLs dynamically instead of having a hardcoded value in the settings. The existing implementations such as FileSystemStorage and StaticFilesStorage don't account for SCRIPT_NAME.</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>StaticFilesHandlerMixin, StaticFilesStorage, StaticFilesStorage.__init__, FileSystemStorage.url, FileSystemStorage, static, media, PrefixNode, StaticNode.render, StaticNode, StaticNode.handle_simple</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **StaticFilesHandlerMixin**: This doesn't directly relate to the STATIC_URL or MEDIA_URL modifications but is relevant due to being part of how WSGI and ASGI handlers use mixins that might need modification to account for SCRIPT_NAME.\n- **StaticFilesStorage**: This class represents the core static file storage implementation that interacts directly with static files. Adjustments are necessary within this class to accommodate the SCRIPT_NAME in handling STATIC_URL and MEDIA_URL.\n- **StaticFilesStorage.__init__**: The constructor is where settings for STATIC_URL and STATIC_ROOT are initialized. Adding logic here may be needed to handle SCRIPT_NAME dynamically.\n- **FileSystemStorage.url**: This method returns URLs for files stored locally and would therefore need modifications to append SCRIPT_NAME.\n- **FileSystemStorage**: The core storage class extends Storage and includes file operations. Amending the url method in this class may be pertinent.\n- **static**: Context processor that adds STATIC_URL to the template context.\n- **media**: Context processor that adds MEDIA_URL to the template context.\n- **PrefixNode**: Not directly relevant in context but impacts how URL prefixes are treated in templating.\n- **StaticNode.render**: The static template tag's render function; this is where the static URL is generated and thus needs change to add SCRIPT_NAME.\n- **StaticNode**: Relates to rendering static files URLs in templates and could need modification.\n- **StaticNode.handle_simple**: This function handles serving static files URL simply within a msg classmethod.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **File: django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py**\n  - **Modified hunk**: Added import of `get_script_prefix`:\n  ```diff\n  -8: from django.conf import settings\n  +9: from django.urls import get_script_prefix\n  ```\n\n- **File: django/core/files/storage.py**\n  - **Introduction of duplicate lines**: The entire section printed from `return self._value_or_setting(self._base_url, settings.MEDIA_URL)` multiple times without this line actually modified content handling SCRIPT_NAME as expected.\n  ```diff\n  +1:         return self._value_or_setting(self._base_url, settings.MEDIA_URL)\n  ```\n- **Adding remove redundant sections CC0:**\n- Retaining code while embedding Multiple from django utils_ENCODING object exceptions MessageBox `<Further Discussion Other Blocks @}` again necessary preservation deviations values:`,` attention exemplification detailing.

Understand the candidate patch:\nFirst, here are the modified hunks:\n- From `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py`: adding an import of `get_script_prefix`.\n- From `django/core/files/storage.py`: Unnecessary repetitive definition of `base_url`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modification in `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` adds `from django.urls import get_script_prefix` which is used to incorporate the script prefix (associated with `SCRIPT_NAME`).\n\nThe modification in `django/core/files/storage.py` introduces multiple identical definitions of a method that simply returns `self._value_or_setting(self._base_url, settings.MEDIA_URL)`, falling into extreme repetition not contributing towards the inclusion of `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe import alteration in `StaticFilesStorage` is pointing to the right location to fetch the script prefix, but the rest of the repeated changes in the base level of storage URL return definitions add no meaningful change or fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the patch introduces new issues by adding redundant repetitive definitions of `base_url` method in `core/files/storage.py`, potentially leading to conflicts and performance degradations while completely missing out on incorporating the necessary logic to handle `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not appropriately address the identified problem listed. Including `get_script_prefix` might have partly helped by facilitating the script prefix functionality required but falls short ridiculously next alone because:\n1. Redundant and incorrect code changes essay leading into repetition pitfalls.\n2. Overlooking on touching critical `handle_simple` or `StaticNode.render` points, where inclusion logic dynamically using `get_script_prefix()` should be programmatically appended or prepending operational affairs.\nThus none of the higher aspect attributes concede fair nuanced intricacies or edge cases accounted informative leading failed patching pursuits altogether.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>0</score>"
