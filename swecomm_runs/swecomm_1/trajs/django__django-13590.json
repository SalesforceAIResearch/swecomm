Named tuples require their contents to be expanded explicitly using the `*` operator when constructing new instances, but the current implementation passes an iterator instead.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans:**\n\nList of Span IDs:\n- `Range`\n- `Query.resolve_lookup_value`\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe `Range` span defines a lookup registered in the `django.db.models` that is likely a typical usage of the queryset filter functionality implicated in the issue.\n\nThe `Query.resolve_lookup_value` span contains the method `resolve_lookup_value`, relevant because it illustrates how lookup values, including tuples, are being processed and reconstituted, causing the TypeError when named tuples are misconstructed.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. original hunk modifying `resolve_lookup_value`\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe provided patch makes an alteration in the `resolve_lookup_value` method:\n- It separately handles named and unnamed tuples.\n- First, it resolves the elements within the tuple.\n- Creates a list `resolved_values` of the resolved tuple elements.\n- Checks if the original tuple (`value`) has the `_fields` attribute, implying that it is a named tuple.\n- Returns a new instance of the named tuple using the `*` operator to unpack `resolved_values`.\n- For unnamed tuples, it returns a new instance directly from `resolved_values`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly modifies the `resolve_lookup_value` function in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which is where the reconstitution of tuples happens, exactly where the TypeError is originating from.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not directly contradict identified code spans but introduces a slight redundancy by checking for `_fields` to identify named tuples. While functionally correct, careful verification against other uses of named tuples in the codebase is necessary.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears effective as it uses the correct approach (`*` operator) to unpack elements into a named tuple's constructor, fixing the TypeError. Examined aspects: \n- No indications of making unreadable API calls, ineffective or faulty logic.\n- Handles edge cases between normal tuples and named tuples.\nHowever, the potential mistake involving redundancy in named tuples checks and potential gaps in testing other named tuple use-cases should be assessed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:**\n\n<score>9</score>"

Hunks replacing lines in resolve_lookup_value method:\nBefore Patch:\n(1072-1084):\n```python\n    def resolve_lookup_value(self, value, can_reuse, allow_joins):\n        if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):\n            value = value.resolve_expression(\n                self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,\n            )\n        elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n            return type(value)(\n                self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n                for sub_value in value\n            )\n        return value\n```\n\nAfter Patch:\n(1072-1090):\n```python\n    def resolve_lookup_value(self, value, can_reuse, allow_joins):\n        if hasattr(value, 'resolve_expression'):\n            value = value.resolve_expression(\n                self, reuse=can_reuse, allow_joins=allow_joins,\n            )\n        elif isinstance(value, tuple) and hasattr(value, '_fields'):\n            return type(value)(*(\n                self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n                for sub_value in value\n            ))\n        elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):\n            return type(value)(\n                self.resolve_lookup_value(sub_value, can_reuse, allow_joins)\n                for sub_value in value\n            )\n        return value\n```\n\nExplanation:\nThe patch adds a check to differentiate between generic tuples and named tuples. If value is a named tuple (i.e., `hasattr(value, '_fields')` is True), it reconstructs the named tuple by expanding the iterator\u2019s contents into the constructor using `*()`. This ensures that the named tuple is reconstituted correctly, avoiding the TypeError.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting the correct function, resolve_lookup_value, in django.db.models.sql.query.Query. This function is responsible for processing the values which could be named tuples, lists, or generic tuples, and was causing the TypeError when handling named tuples.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It smartly adds a new condition to handle named tuples without changing the handling of list and generic tuples. It appears consistent with the logic of resolving values within the function.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue of handling named tuples correctly by checking whether the value is a named tuple and then properly reconstructing the named tuple using `*()`. This modification ensures that the function correctly processes named tuples without causing TypeError. The potential common mistakes have been avoided: \n1. The solution does not introduce repetitive code.\n2. The API usage is correct for tuple handling.\n3. Edge cases are explicitly considered by checking for the named tuple with `_fields`. \n\nThus, the patch successfully resolves the identified issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The type of issue occurs because `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` dives into the elements of a tuple to resolve the lookups but errors out when it tries to reconstruct the tuple with the resolved elements due to how named tuples handle their constructor arguments.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\nList of Span IDs: Range, Query.resolve_lookup_value\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Range (django/db/models/lookups.py)**: This code span shows the implementation of the `Range` class which uses the `Field.register_lookup` decorator and directly relates to querying with range filters.\n- **Query.resolve_lookup_value (django/db/models/sql/query.py)**: This code span contains the `resolve_lookup_value` method that delves into the elements of a tuple to resolve expressions and then reconstitutes the tuple, which is exactly where the TypeError occurs due to incorrect handling of named tuples.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks: Only one modified hunk\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` adds a condition to specifically handle named tuples inside the existing `resolve_lookup_value` method. If the `value` is a tuple and has the `_fields` attribute (indicative of a named tuple), it resolves the expressions within the tuple elements, and reconstructs the named tuple properly by expanding the contents of the iterator into the constructor using `*`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the `resolve_lookup_value` method in the `Query` class in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`, which is correct because the TypeError originates from incorrect handling of reconstructions in this method as identified in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues, as it only adds additional handling specifically for named tuples without altering the existing logic for ordinary lists and tuples.

This is directly relevant because named tuples causing the `TypeError` in question are part of these range lookups.\n   \n2. **Query.resolve_lookup_value (django/db/models/sql/query.py)**: This method handles resolving values like lists or tuples into their constituent values for queries. It is the function that is malfunctioning by improperly reconstituting named tuples without expanding the contents of their iterator, resulting in the `TypeError`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks: \n1. Insertion and modification within the `resolve_lookup_value` function.\n\nExplanation:\n1. The `resolve_lookup_value` function is updated to identify named tuples specifically by checking if the value `isinstance` of `tuple` and has an attribute `_fields` (which is characteristic of named tuples). Then, it attempts to resolve the lookup value for each sub-element recursively and reconstitutes the named tuple using expanded (`*`) values from the iterator, thus preventing the `TypeError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the right function, `resolve_lookup_value`. This function is directly responsible for aiding in resolving values of type list or tuple, which aligns correctly with resolving the named tuple issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is quite specific in addressing named tuples and does not seem to interfere with other parts of the function or introduce repetitive code. Thus, it doesn't contradict with the identified code spans significantly. However, it adds an edge case simply handled with an `if` clause which is appropriate for this situation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nRegarding common mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: The patch doesn't introduce repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: It uses Python standard inspections (checking `_fields` to identify named tuples) correctly.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The patch directly addresses the named tuple edge case without overlooking scenarios within the confines of the contributors.\n\nThe patch successfully fixes the issue by expanding the iterator when creating named tuples, which effectively prevents the `TypeError`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

However, common issues that need to be verified include ensuring repeated cases aren't checked multiple times. In this patch, `value` is already identified as a `tuple`, so it might run another tuple check twice. Checking again for other cases should warrant a quick session to ensure refactoring priorities don\u2019t break.
