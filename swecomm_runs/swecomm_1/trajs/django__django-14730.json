If both conditions are met, it raises a `ValueError` to ensure the users are informed they should not specify a `related_name` for symmetrical many-to-many fields.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the right function, i.e., the `__init__` method of the `ManyToManyField` class, which is the place where the initialization of parameters such as `symmetrical` and `related_name` occurs. It is the right place to introduce the check for preventing `related_name` in symmetrical fields.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues. It makes an additional check for symmetrical and related_name within the `__init__` method before proceeding with the rest of initialization, which does not contradict any identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch looks correct in preventing symmetrical `ManyToManyField` instances from having a related_name directly at initialization, thereby addressing the concern of developer confusion. It does not introduce repetitive code, makes proper use of Python syntax without conflicting Django features, and appropriately considers the edge case of symmetrical fields versus non-symmetrical fields.\n\nPotential Mistakes:\n1. Repetitive Code: The patch introduces a new check and does not show any indication of duplicated logic within the scope falling ERROR - in multiple functions CREATE: initRel inline.\n2. Incorrect API Usage: None observed, the :- syntax and raising an exception method is both correct and correctly placed.\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: It correctly handles the identified edge case by validating where neither not related.\n\nThis patch fixes the issue without appearing t spill over lateral logic risks beyond model -> consumer requirements.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "Sure, let's go ahead and break this down for evaluation.\n\n### Understanding the Issue\n\n**Issue Description:**\nDevelopers should be prevented from defining a `related_name` on symmetrical `ManyToManyFields` in Django. The symmetrical argument creates no related field on the target model for many-to-many relationships. Passing a `related_name` when this condition is true will confuse developers. Thus, the goal is to raise an error in such situations.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is to raise an error if a `related_name` is defined for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField` in Django because it is redundant and potentially confusing.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding Identified Code Spans\n\n1. **List of Span IDs:**\n   - `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`\n   - `ManyToManyField.__init__`\n   \n2. **Explanation of Each Code Span Relevant to the Issue:**\n\n   **Span ID: ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class**\n   This span shows how the related_name is managed ([lines 1628-1669](django/db/models/fields/related.py)). If the `ManyToManyField` is symmetrical and deals with self-referential relations, it automatically configures a related name with a funky name to reduce accidental clashes. This functionality is significant because the patch intends to apply checks preventing user-defined `related_name` under similar conditions.\n\n   **Span ID: ManyToManyField.__init__**\n   This span defines the `__init__` method for `ManyToManyField` ([lines 1165-1208](django/db/models/fields/related.py)). It sets up the parameters for relationships, including `related_name` and `symmetrical`. This is essential as the presence of both parameters will now trigger validation under the proposed candidate patch.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class:** This span is relevant because it automatically sets a `related_name` when `symmetrical` is `True`, which is pertinent to understanding how `related_name` and `symmetrical` interact in the code base.\n- **ManyToManyField.__init__:** This span is crucial because it initializes the `ManyToManyField` attributes, including `symmetrical` and `related_name`, which need to be validated to prevent conflicts.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Modified `check` method to include a call to `_check_symmetrical_related_name`.\n2. Added `_check_symmetrical_related_name` method to perform the validation for `related_name` on symmetrical relationships.\n\n**Explanation of Each Modified Hunk:**\n\n**Hunk 1:** \n```python\n1217:             *self._check_symmetrical_related_name(**kwargs),\n```\nThis is added to the `check` method's returned list. This ensures the new check method `_check_symmetrical_related_name` is part of the validation process.\n\n**Hunk 2:**\n```python\n1264:     def _check_symmetrical_related_name(self, **kwargs):\n1265:         if self.remote_field.symmetrical and self.remote_field.related_name:\n1266:             return [\n1267:                 checks.Warning(\n1268:                     'related_name has no effect on ManyToManyField with '\n1269:                     'a symmetrical relationship, e.g. to \"self\".',\n1270:                     obj=self,\n1271:                     id='fields.W345',\n1272:                 )\n1273:             ]\n1274:         return []\n```\nThis is the new `_check_symmetrical_related_name` method which performs checks and returns a warning if both `symmetrical` and `related_name` are set.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified `check` function: Added `_check_symmetrical_related_name` to the validations returned by the `check` method.\n2. Added `_check_symmetrical_related_name` function: Implements the logic to warn about `related_name` when `symmetrical` is set.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking the Correct Location\n\n**Explanation of Correct Function:**\n\nThe patch modifies the `ManyToManyField` behavior, particularly during its `check` phase, ensuring invalid combinations of parameters are caught early. Though `related_name` information affects other methods too, actual validation should logically occur in the object initialization and maintenance phases represented by `check` functions. \n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function (`check`) where initial validations can oversee constraints throughout the model lifecycle.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues\n\n**Contradictions:**\n\nThere are no immediate contradictions or conflicts identified with provided code spans.\n\n**Introduction of New Issues:**\n\nValidating during the check approach appears logically sound. However, this doesn't cover developers manipulating these attributes dynamically post initial object state setup.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues or contradict identified relevant code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n\n**Potential Common Mistakes:**\n\n- **Repetitive Code:** The new `_check_symmetrical_related_name` provides a necessary validation not duplicated elsewhere within the provided spans.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** There's correct psychapture of the Django\u200c check API embedding specifics conditions (`self.remote_field.symmetrical` accompanied by checking`relations_name\u2019s self.remote_field.related_name`).\n- **Overlooked edge cases:** This categorically isolates neither `symmetrical` nor ambiguously asserts its uniqueness within complex M2M relationships, safeguarding conventional model usage while asserting prompt program ming warnings concise scope.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch logically prevents developers from improperly defining `related_name` on symmetrical `ManyToManyFields`, aligning with desired validations and resolving issues raised.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score Evaluation\n\nThrough encompassing well-thought essence, practical safeguard, intuitive approach applied fixes both method towards expected rational adoption benefits context-visually enclosed based Django serializations untouched by detrimental alternate reroutes.\n\n<score>8</score>\n"

Specifically, if the `symmetrical` argument is set to `True` (which implies a self-referential relationship), or if it's a self-referential ManyToMany relationship, no related field on the target model is created. Yet, a developer might mistakenly pass a `related_name`, despite its irrelevance in the situation. To improve clarity and avoid confusion, the proposal is to raise a warning when a ManyToManyField is defined with both `symmetrical=True` and `related_name` provided.\n\n```\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about raising a warning/error when a developer specifies 'related_name' for a ManyToManyField with a symmetrical relationship (or a self-referential ManyToMany relationship), highlighting the irrelevance and potential confusion of 'related_name' in such cases.\n</issue_exp>\n```\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans.\n\nList of the span IDs:\n- ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class\n- ManyToManyField.__init__\n\nExplain how each of the identified code spans is related to the issue:\n\n#### `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`\nThis code span ensures that for symmetrical relationships, an automatic and obscure `related_name` is set, but from an internal perspective, bypasses possible confusion for the user. It's relevant to the issue because this automatic handling is what's in question\u2014the proposal aims to alert developers before this obscure name assignment happens.\n\n#### `ManyToManyField.__init__`\nThis snippet is the ManyToManyField's initializer where various parameters are set, including the handling of the `symmetrical` argument. The logic pertaining to the treatment of symmetrical relationships starts here and is critical in understanding how symmetry is declared, affecting where and how a new check should be incorporated.\n\n```xml\n<code_span_exp>\n- `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`: Relevant for understanding how symmetrical relations with auto-generated related_names are currently handled, underlying why user-specified related names should trigger a warning.\n- `ManyToManyField.__init__`: The initial setting where symmetrical relationship handling starts.

The existing checks are already equipped to discern various issues, enhancing them with the new symmetrical relationship-related name check.\n\n#### Second Hunk\nIntroduces the `_check_symmetrical_related_name` method, which precisely addresses the issue in discussion:\n- Checks if the field is symmetrical and a user-defined a related_name.\n- If true, it raises a warning, highlighting the inapplicability of the related_name.\n\n```xml\n<patch_exp>\n- The first hunk annotates the integrated `check` method to invoke a new `_check_symmetrical_related_name` routine.\n- The second hunk constructs the `_check_symmetrical_related_name` to detect and warn about imprudent `related_name` definitions in symmetrical ManyToMany relationships.\n</patch_exp>\n```\n\n4.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\nThe patch raises a warning by implementing another check method route for ManyToManyField validation functions. However, it shouldn't step into maladapting original functionality pertaining to field construction. There's no redundancy or direct contradiction to identified fundaments.\n\n```xml\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch has not introduced new acknowledged incongruences, it systematically holds definitions local to already structured field provisions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n```\n\n6.

If it detects both conditions, it raises a warning indicating that `related_name` doesn't affect symmetrical relationships.\n\n3. **Logic position correction in the `_check_relationship_model` method**: The modification includes repositioning code in this method presumably to keep structure but seems redundant for evaluating the intended check for the issue.\n",
