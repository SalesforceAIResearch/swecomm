It's relevant because it handles adding the related fields to the selection, which needs to work with `only()`.\n2. `QuerySet.only`: This is the method that dictates which fields should be included in the queryset and should exclude other fields. `select_related` should follow this schema when it's in use.\n3. `Query.get_select_mask`: Generates a data structure that describes the fields that will be loaded. It plays a role in determining which fields are loaded in SQL queries originating from the `QuerySet`.\n4. `Query.add_select_related`: Sets up the structure to ensure only certain related models are selected. It's essential for the select_related part of the issue to function correctly with `only()`.\n5. `Query.add_immediate_loading`: Adds fields for immediate retrieval, which means it most probably affects the way `select_related` and `only` interact.\n6. `Query.solve_lookup_type`: It breaks down the lookup path, following Django's double-underscore convention which likely contributes to identifying the specific fields that need to be included or deferred.\n7. `Query._get_only_select_mask`: This aids in filtering a model\u2019s attributes to adhere to what\u2019s requested in the query specifically applying the related constraints in a method compatible with `only` and `select_related`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_hunks>\n- django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py: Line 358-365\n- django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py: Line 366-374\n</patch_hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. In `django/db/models/fields/related_descriptors.py` from line 366: A block was added to recheck deferred fields. The existing return statement logic was repeated verbatim creating redundancy instead of modifying or enhancing functionality.\n2. The second check in lines from 366 to 374 appears to duplicate existing logic, which results in unnecessary repetitive code that offers no new safeguarding or logic-advancing contribution.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nWhile the patch does touch code within `related_descriptors.py`, which handles related model functionality, the candidate changes don\u2019t seem to correctly address the root cause of translating combination of `only` and `select_related` into SQL. Hence, it doesn't focus on the targeted methods that influence which fields should be included in the select query as described in the spans.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces redundant repetitive blocks of code in `related_descriptors.py`. This adds more statements without any new functioning consideration which can lead to maintenance issues without addressing edge cases for the required queryset control functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The addition in the patch doubles logic that was already in place without modifications, which will lead to redundancy.  \n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: The API functions and overrides within  `fields_related` do focus on how join fields are fetched; however, the actual interplay between `QuerySet.only` and `select_related` must modify SQL determination at an earlier query spectrum (like in `.query.add_select_related` found within `sql.query.py` endpoints).\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The edge cases are overlooked, introducing no new logic to ensure that wrong fields are excluded from SQL leading the error remaining the same with unnecessary extra call paths introduced. Thus leading to continued improper field inclusions which even defies the desired issue fix. \n\nTherefore, the issue is not notably fixed under the imposed repetition and sidelines touching unrelated portion semi-context in `related_descriptor`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>\n</data_analysis>"
