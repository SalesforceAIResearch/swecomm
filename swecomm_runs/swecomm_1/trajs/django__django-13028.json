Modification in check_filterable function in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The modified `check_filterable` function no longer raises an error if the expression is a model instance or if the `filterable` attribute doesn't need to be checked. It adds additional checks to skip model instances and the 'filterable' attribute before proceeding to the original checks and potential error raise.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking if Fix is in Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing code within the `check_filterable` method, which is responsible for verifying whether an expression can be included in a WHERE clause.

By skipping the check for these cases, it resolves the reported error without altering the function's core functionality.\n\nConsidering the common mistakes:\n1. Repetitive code: The patch does not introduce any repetitive code.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The patch correctly uses Django's APIs, specifically checking for model instances properly.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: The patch effectively considers edge cases \u2014 model instances and filterable attributes.\n\nTherefore, the patch appears to fix the issue comprehensively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This is directly related to the issue because `ProductMetaDataType` has a field `filterable` which is causing the `NotSupportedError`.\n   \n2. **Query.build_filter**:\n   - The `build_filter` method is responsible for constructing a filter clause in SQL. It calls the `check_filterable` method on parts of the filter climb to ensure all parts meet the requirements. In this case, it\u2019s relevant because it ensures that filtering does not use `ProductMetaDataType` improperly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n```modified_hunks: [\"<after_file=\\\"b/django/db/models/sql/query.py\\\" start_line=1118>\"]```\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `check_filterable` method by adding specific handling to:\n1.

Candidate Patch\nWe will break down each piece of the patch to understand its implications and what changes are being made.\n\n#### Modified Hunks\n1. **Hunk Explanation 1** (`check_filterable` function)\n    - **Before Patch**:\n    ```python\n    def check_filterable(self, expression):\n        \"\"\"Raise an error if expression cannot be used in a WHERE clause.\"\"\"\n        if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n            raise NotSupportedError(\n                expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n                'clause.'\n            )\n        if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):\n            for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():\n                self.check_filterable(expr)\n    ```\n\n    - **After Patch**:\n    ```python\n    def check_filterable(self, expression):\n        \"\"\"\n        Override to handle specific cases:\n        - Skip the filterability check for model instances.\n        - Skip the filterability check for the 'filterable' attribute.\n        \"\"\"\n        from django.db import models\n        if isinstance(expression, models.Model):\n            return\n        if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n            raise NotSupportedError(\n                expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter '\n                'clause.'\n            )\n        if hasattr(expression, 'get_source_expressions'):\n            for expr in expression.get_source_expressions():\n                self.check_filterable(expr)\n    ```\n\n```xml\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch modifies the `check_filterable` function to add two conditions:\n- Skip the `filterable` check if the expression is a Django model instance (`models.Model`).\n- Additional documentation to indicate these overrides.\nThis guards against raising a `NotSupportedError` for model instance filters directly.\n</patch_exp>\n```\n\n### 4. Is the Patch Fixing the Correct Location?\nTo verify, let\u2019s see if the patch modifies the correct area:\n\n```xml\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `Query.check_filterable`, which directly deals with raising `NotSupportedError` based on the `filterable` attribute.\n</correct_location_exp>\n```\n\n### 5. Introduction of Any New Issues\nWe now need to analyze if the patch introduces any new issues:\n\n- The patch adds a fast path exit in `check_filterable` if the expression is a model instance, which should not introduce any additional logical issues.\n\n```xml\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues as it logically skips the `filterable` check for model instances safely. Additionally, it adheres to the relevant code spans constraints logically.\n</new_issues_exp>\n```\n\n### 6. Evaluating if the Patch Fixes the Issue\nWe need to see if the candidate patch adequately addresses the original issue and avoids any common mistakes LLMs might make.\n\n**Checklist**:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: No evidence of repetitive logic.\n2. **Correct API Usage**: Correctly using Django's model and attribute-checking mechanism.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Has consideration for direct model instance filters, which seems adequate without deeper edge cases examined.\n\n```xml\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch logically skips the `filterable` check for model instances, a necessary step correct the raised `NotSupportedError` when filtering by certain fields. It does not introduce repetitive code, appears to use Django APIs correctly, and accounts for the mentioned edge case in the provided issue description.\n\nOne may argue for thorough edge case considerations, such as nested expressions or more complex query scenarios. Nonetheless, as per the described issue, the patch reasonably addresses the presented error case.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n```\n\n### Final Score\nGiven the considerations, my evaluation yields the following score:\n\n```xml\n<score>8</score>\n```"

Repetitive code: No repetitive code observed.\n2. Incorrect API usage: Potentially risky bypassing established filtering constraints bypass just shooting `return`.\n3.

This implies that the `filterable=False` attribute in model fields is causing the filtering operation to raise errors, which is unexpected and should be fixed.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue occurs when filtering on the `metadata_type` field in the `ProductMetaData` model due to the `filterable=False` attribute being incorrectly disallowed. This raises a `NotSupportedError`.</issue_exp>\n\n## Code Span Explanation\n### List of Span IDs\n1. Query.check_filterable\n2. Query.build_filter\n\n### Explanation of Code Spans\n1. **Query.check_filterable**: This span defines the `check_filterable` method, which raises a `NotSupportedError` when an expression has `filterable=False`. This is the root cause of the issue.\n2. **Query.build_filter**: This span defines the `build_filter` method, where the `check_filterable(value)` method is called for each filtering value to ensure the filter is valid. This span leads to where the `check_filterable` method is invoked, contributing to the error being raised.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `Query.check_filterable` is responsible for raising the `NotSupportedError`, which is the core function causing the reported issue.\n2. `Query.build_filter` contains the call to `check_filterable`, which is where the problem triggers when attempting to filter data.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n## Patch Explanation\n### List of Modified Hunks\n1. Content from lines 1125 to 1140 in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`.\n\n### Explanation of Modified Hunks\n1. The patch initially attempts to handle expressions with `resolve_expression` attributes multiple times, unnecessarily duplicating the checking lines.\n2.

This is unwanted surplus logic introducing unnecessary clutter without need.</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Issue Fix Assessment\nThe patch shows common mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: Multiple redundant code lines (`if hasattr(expression, 'resolve_expression')` repeats).\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The repeated conditional checks lead to confusing and conflicting logic.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: Not clear if it definitely now respects objects with and without `resolve_expression`.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch makes the mistake of introducing repetitive code lines, leading to excessive redundant conditional checks, making it poorly handled.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>\n"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the issue:**\n\nThe issue arises when attempting to filter a Django queryset using a `metadata_type` field on the `ProductMetaData` model, which contains a `filterable` boolean field. When the field is used with its `filterable` attribute set to `False`, a `NotSupportedError` is thrown. This unexpected behavior causes filtering by this field to fail unless changes are made to the label. \n\nOutput:\n<issue_exp>The issue concerns the filtering of a Django queryset where an RHS (Right Hand Side) field has the `filterable=False` attribute. This results in a `NotSupportedError` being raised. Specifically, when the `ProductMetaData` model is filtered by `metadata_type`, the error occurs because the `metadata_type` field has the attribute `filterable=False`.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\nList of span ids:\n```\n- Query.check_filterable\n- Query.build_filter\n```\n\nExplanation of each code span:\n\n- **Query.check_filterable**: This function checks if an expression (such as a field) is allowed to be used in a WHERE clause. It raises a `NotSupportedError` if the field isn\u2019t filterable. The issue specifically centers around this function, as the error occurs during this filterable check.\n\n- **Query.build_filter**: This function builds a filter clause for a single filter expression. It includes checks to ensure that the fields being filtered have the required properties, and the `check_filterable` function gets called here to ensure fields are filterable. This code spans is relevant as it calls `check_filterable`, hence directly contributing to the observed issue.\n\nOutput:\n<code_span_exp>\nQuery.check_filterable: This function enforces the rule that any expression used in a WHERE clause must be filterable. If the expression is not filterable, it raises a `NotSupportedError`. This is the function that throws the error described in the issue.\nQuery.build_filter: Responsible for constructing the filter clause when filtering queries. It calls `check_filterable` on the filter expressions to enforce filtering constraints, thus it's directly related to where and how the error described in the issue is triggered.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n```plaintext\n2583, line range: 1119 - 1140\n```\n\nExplanation of what the modified hunk is doing:\n```plaintext\nIn the patched section, multiple redundant checks are added to verify whether an expression has the 'resolve_expression' attribute and whether the 'filterable' attribute of the expression is False. It appears there are many lines just repeating conditional checks introduced in this code span.\n```\n\nOutput:\n<patch_exp>\nHunk at line range 1119 - 1140: Introduces repetitive conditions for checking if the expression has the `resolve_expression` attribute and if its `filterable` attribute is set to False. Multiple checks are repeated, adding unnecessary duplication.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\nThis patch affects the `check_filterable` function which is directly responsible for raising the error described, specifically checking for the `filterable` attribute and subsequently disallowing fields. However, the function's logic is convoluted and the repetitive nature of the checks doesn't change the underlying logic sufficiently to fix the issue effectively.\n\nOutput:\n<correct_location_exp>The patch attempts to fix the correct function, `check_filterable`, which is responsible for raising the `NotSupportedError` mentioned in the issue description.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\nThe added patch contains overly repetitive checks which indicate poor code quality and complicate debugging. It doesn't introduce functionality that inherently contradicts identified code spans, but this duplicated logic could cause unintended side effects under maintainable scopes like performance degradation.\n\nOutput:\n<new_issues_exp>The patch introduces significant code repetition, which not only makes the function harder to read and maintain but also potentially introduces performance issues without solving the core problem effectively. Though no contradictions arise, the patch declines coding standards.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\nThe primary mistakes of LLMs include repetitive code, which is evident in this patch. Additionally, the patch does not fully resolve the filtering issue described but introduces unstructured, replicated constructs that clutter the function\u2019s logic while failing to correct the condition. The patch clearly falls short concerning functionality whereby it minimally adapts provided specifications.\n\nOutput:\n<fix_issue_exp>This patch falls into the common pitfalls of LLMs by introducing highly repetitive code designed poorly. It doesn\u2019t successfully address the problem as the root contributory roadblock in the `check_filterable` isn't resolved innovatively or logically sufficient bypass underlying constraints.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final score:**\nI gave it a negative score because although attempts are made to amend the right location, the patch largely induces redundancy, cakewalk dependencies unsettling clarity. Consequently not modularly adherent - problematic chances enforcing integrity.\n\n<score>-1</score>"
