The identified lines within this method include the logic for appending drawing commands to a stream, where the issue with handling empty lines in a multi-line text label occurs. This span is directly relevant as it contains the code that needs adjustments to handle empty lines properly without causing a `TypeError`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch. First curate a list of modified hunks. For each modified hunk, explain what it's doing. Output your explanation in the <patch_exp></patch_exp> field.\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of Modified Hunks:\n1. Hunk in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py` starting at line 669\n\nExplanation of Each Hunk:\n- The original code attempted to append `curr_stream` to `stream` both unconditionally at line 669 and iterated over `curr_stream` without regard for its contents at line 673. These operations caused the issue when `curr_stream` was `None`, pertaining to the empty lines leading to `TypeError`.\n  \nPatch Changes:\n- Added a new conditional `if curr_stream and curr_stream[1]` at line 669, such that `curr_stream` is only appended if it is not `None` and has content.\n- Introduced a new condition within the for loop at line 675 to skip any empty `xs_names` streams instead of causing processing on empty or NoneType objects.\nEssentially, these changes ensure that any empty `curr_stream` is excluded, thus avoiding the TypeError by ensuring operations only apply to valid streams.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not. Output your explanation in the <correct_location_exp></correct_location_exp> field.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The updates are made within the `RendererPS.draw_text` method, which is precisely where the rendering logic that handles text and its grouping is created and processed to resolve the unpacking error.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans. Output your explanation in the <new_issues_exp></new_issues_exp> field.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues or contradict with the identified code spans. It applies additional checks to ensure objects being processed are not `NoneType` and contain actual streams, effectively preventing the original `TypeError` without introducing any other evident faults.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch against the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes. Output your explanation in the <fix_issue_exp></fix_issue_exp> field.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch corrects the issue by ensuring that only non-NoneType streams with content are appended and processed. Evaluation against common LLM generated patch mistakes confirms it:\n1. Repetitive Code: There is no repetitive or redundant block introduced by the conditional checks.\n2. Incorrect API Usage: The API and the rendering logic from the framework have been correctly continued in usage.\n3. Overlooking Edge Cases: The patch specifically addresses edge cases involving empty contents within the `curr_stream`.\n\nGiven careful review for the potential pitfalls typically seen with LLM patches, this generated code properly handles the specific issue identified and applies a valid fix robustly without newfound errors.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7.

If there is a multi-line text label containing an empty line, a \"TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object\" occurs. This error prevents saving the figure in EPS format. The bug happens due to the handling of streams when drawing the text, where an empty stream causes the error.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\nList of span ids:\n- `RendererPS`\n- `RendererPS.draw_text`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n`RendererPS`: This class, starting at line 253, is responsible for handling all the drawing primitives with a graphics context. It's the primary class being used in the PostScript backend.\n\n`RendererPS.draw_text`: This method, starting at line 617, is heavily involved in the process of rendering text in the figure. The code here manages how different fonts and glyph streams are compiled and drawn, which is directly relevant because the error occurs during the drawing of text.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- From `before_file=\"a/lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py\" line 661` to `after_file=\"b/lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py\" line 669`\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch introduces a check before appending the last stream entry:\n1. It adds a conditional statement at the end before appending `curr_stream` to `stream`. If `curr_stream` is truthy (i.e., not `None` or an empty list), it appends it to avoid appending a `None` value.\n\n2. This check solves the issue where `None` was being appended to the stream, leading to the \"TypeError\" during unpacking.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The error occurs in the `draw_text` method of the `RendererPS` class. The patch's insertion points address the handling of the `stream` list, which was leading to the \"TypeError.\"\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues. It simply ensures that a non-iterable (NoneType) object is not appended to the stream list, which is the cause of the original issue. This change aligns with the existing pattern of checks surrounding stream appends and does not appear to conflict with other identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adds a necessary check without repetitive logic or incorrect API usage. By validating `curr_stream` before appending, it prevents the exact situation that led to the \"TypeError.\u201d This ensures no empty or `None` streams are appended to the final stream list, thus resolving the original issue. No edge cases appear to be missed in regard to the core issue specified.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
