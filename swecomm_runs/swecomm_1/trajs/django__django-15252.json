                    "msg": "Let's start evaluating the information step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the issue\n\nThe main task involves understanding the provided issue description:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue revolves around Django's MigrationRecorder where an issue is observed in a multi-database environment. The MigrationRecorder doesn't respect the database router's allow_migrate rules. In such a setup, the expectation is that migration-related tables and operations should only occur on the 'default' connection. Unfortunately, migrations try to execute across all defined databases, leading to unwanted schema changes in non-primary databases.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n\nFirst, let's list the span IDs provided:\n- MigrationExecutor\n- MigrationExecutor.apply_migration\n- MigrationExecutor.record_migration\n- MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema\n- MigrationRecorder\n- MigrationRecorder.record_applied\n- ConnectionRouter\n- ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate\n\nNow, we'll expand on their relevance:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- MigrationExecutor: This class handles the end-to-end execution of migrations.\n- MigrationExecutor.apply_migration: This method applies a specific migration, and as part of its operations, it involves recording the migration.\n- MigrationExecutor.record_migration: This method records that a migration has been applied, which internally calls MigrationRecorder.record_applied.\n- MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema: Ensures that the migration table exists in the database.\n- MigrationRecorder: Class responsible for handling migration records in the database.\n- MigrationRecorder.record_applied: Records that a particular migration was applied, and calls ensure_schema.\n- ConnectionRouter: Class that executes router operations by consulting user-defined database routers.\n- ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate: Determines if a migration operation is allowed on a specific database using the custom router logic defined.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n\nLet's list the modified Hunks:\n\n#### Hunk 1:\n`django/db/migrations/recorder.py` starting at line 53:\nModifications break down into:\n- Addition of is_migration_allowed() method.\n- Introduces a routing check within the ensure_schema() and record_applied() methods.\n\n#### Hunk 2:\n`django/db/migrations/recorder.py` starting at line 81:\nModifications:\n- Ensures that record_applied and record_unapplied respect whether migration is allowed by checking through the adjusted is_migration_allowed method.\n\nCurated explanation for each hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\n**Hunk 1** begins with:\n- Checking if migrations are permitted using 'is_migration_allowed' inside ensure_schema(). If migrations are not allowed, it returns early without creating/syncing any schema changes in the other DBs.\n- This ensures schema maintenance only happens where allowed\n\n**Hunk 2** applies the check to recording functions (record_applied, record_unapplied). Before any operations related to recording migrations, it verifies if migrations are allowed on this connecting DB, else it exits early.\n- Introduced the method `is_migration_allowed` which queries the user-implemented routing logic to decide the actions allowed for migrations on provided DB connections.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Function Check\n\nLet's ensure the patch is modifying the correct locations:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch fixes locations `ensure_schema()`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods within `MigrationRecorder`, which aligns correctly per their descriptions within the `issue_description`. Hence, it addresses appropriate functions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\nCheck introduction possibility concern points within the patch:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch aligns quite gracefully within the provided structure using explicit router verification before running intended schema operations.\nDetected seamless flow validates established logic within the router method and applies to concerned methods in a non-disruptive manner. Therefore presents no inherent contradiction.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Verify issue fixing competence\n\nWe critically compare to identify any common mistakes:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive Code**: There's no repetitive logic present.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The application checks correctly vitrifying the `router.allow_migrate` within patch inclusion.\n3. **Edge Cases**:\n   - Routing middleware compliance and premature return extend handling unsupported databases, ensuring rogue schema operations are off UNIX scope beyond defaults.\n\ubd09 of elegantly extending router verification can't detract operational resiliency whether DB routing in ungodly manner.Ok Cross marking responsible routing-restrict batting-based implementations per router abstraction validate situation hasn't eroded finale.\n\nThe patch covers critical scenarios sufficiently bolstering initial unconformity recompellations.

If migrations are not allowed, the function returns immediately.\n- The changes in `record_applied` and `record_unapplied` include a check using `is_migration_allowed`. If migrations are not allowed, these functions return immediately.\n- A new method `is_migration_allowed` is added to the MigrationRecorder class, which uses the database router to check if migrations are permitted on the current database.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct functions.

Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by introducing checks using the database router's allow_migrate rules before making schema changes or recording migration states. This effectively prevents the MigrationRecorder from affecting non-default databases as specified in the issue. Given the usual LLM-generated code issues:\n1. Repetitive code: The patch introduces a helper method (`is_migration_allowed`) which avoids repetition.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The patch correctly uses the Router API for migration checks.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: It seems to handle the primary edge cases around whether migrations are allowed before recording them.\n\nOverall, the patch appears to appropriately handle the problem without apparent contradictions in the logic related to the identified spans.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue describes a problem where the `MigrationRecorder` class does not respect the database router's `allow_migrate` rules in a multi-database Django setup. This causes tables to be created on databases where migrations should be disallowed, as per the router's rules.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- MigrationExecutor\n- MigrationExecutor.apply_migration\n- MigrationExecutor.record_migration\n- MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema\n- MigrationRecorder\n- MigrationRecorder.record_applied\n- ConnectionRouter\n- ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate\n\nExplanation:\n1. `MigrationExecutor`: This class is responsible for executing migrations, which includes running them up or down to specific targets.\n2. `MigrationExecutor.apply_migration`: A method in the MigrationExecutor that runs a migration forward, potentially calling the `record_migration`.\n3. `MigrationExecutor.record_migration`: A method in MigrationExecutor responsible for recording the migration, which interacts with `MigrationRecorder`.\n4. `MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema`: Ensures that the schema for recording migrations exists, a task that could interfere with the routing rules.\n5. `MigrationRecorder`: Houses the logic for storing and managing migration records.\n6. `MigrationRecorder.record_applied`: Method records when a migration is applied, triggering `ensure_schema`.\n7. `ConnectionRouter`: The router class used to determine routing behavior for database operations.\n8. `ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate`: Determines if migrations are permitted on specified databases; central to fixing the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Recoder: recorder.py\n- `ensure_schema` method is updated with `is_migration_allowed` checks before doing anything.\n- `record_applied` method now checks `is_migration_allowed` before recording migration and calling `ensure_schema`.\n- `record_unapplied` method now checks `is_migration_allowed` before recording unapplication and calling `ensure_schema`.\n- Added an `is_migration_allowed` method that uses `ConnectionRouter` to check whether migrations are allowed for the current database and model.\n\n2. Added `is_migration_allowed` to Recorder class, implements routing rules into schema handling.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct function. It modifies the functions within the `MigrationRecorder` that are directly related to recording migrations (`record_applied`, `record_unapplied`) and ensuring schema (`ensure_schema`), thereby integrating the necessary routing logic.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. The methods mentioned execute efficiently using the `is_migration_allowed` function, and no evident contradictions with identified code spans are present.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. Incorrect API usage: None observed. Usage of `allow_migrate` API from the `ConnectionRouter` and suitable injection within the new `is_migration_allowed` method appears correct.\n2. Underestimation of Edge cases: Considering database routers are more complex usually, this basic form of routing through a simplistic router might underperform complex scenarios where certain apps might be selectively migrated within complex environments if placed properly in any database adding. This basic routing though correct needs more edge casing for finer-grained control.\n3.

Introduction of a new method `is_migration_allowed` to the `MigrationRecorder`.\n\nExplanation of each hunk:\n<patch_exp>\n1. **File b/django/db/migrations/recorder.py (lines 59-71):** This code alters the `ensure_schema` method to check if migration is allowed using `is_migration_allowed` before proceeding to ensure the schema, conditionally creating the table if permitted.\n2. **File b/django/db/migrations/recorder.py (lines 87-92):** This code updates the `record_applied` method by adding a similar check to `is_migration_allowed` to halt recording applied migration if it's disallowed by the router.\n3. **File b/django/db/migrations/recorder.py (lines 94-99):** Analogous to the method change in `record_applied`, here it introduces a check to `record_unapplied` to allow migrations only on proper databases.\n4. **File b/django/db/migrations/recorder.py (lines 101-109):** This code snippet implements the `is_migration_allowed` method which utilizes `connection.router.allow_migrate` to determine if migration operation to track by `MigrationRecorder` methods is valid in the given connection context.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly addresses modifications in the `ensure_schema`, `record_applied`, and `record_unapplied` methods in the `MigrationRecorder` class which is relevant to the issue of respecting the migration router's rule of allowing or disallowing migration.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues:**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere doesn't seem to be any direct contradictions, and it doesn't seem that any new issues or misalignments are introduced by the patch to identified relevant spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue:**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to correctly address the issue at hand by ensuring that migrations are only executed and recorded in databases where they are permitted according to the router. \n\nCommon mistakes checklist:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** The added method and condition checks are appropriately reused.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** The patch seems to correctly make use of the migration and routing APIs provided by Django.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Edge cases should be adequately handled since migrations are curtailed as per the colink logic provided by the database router.\n\nAdditional trifling: There's a minor concern on whether flushing logic in the `flush()` method might also require migration pruning which could be extending check under controllers pseudo-specific. No explicit edge seen here warranting clarification.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score:**\n\nThe candidate patch seems very well-targeted without evident issues or contradictions:\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "1. Understanding the issue:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue revolves around migrating databases when using Django. Normally, in a multi-db setup, Django should perform migrations only on the 'default' database. However, currently, it tries to apply migrations on all databases, disregarding the custom router that restricts migrations to the 'default' database solely. This leads to attempts to create the `django_migrations` table on non-default databases. The issue necessitates ensuring that the MigrationRecorder adheres to db_router rules when deciding to run these migration-related commands.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n\n- **Code Span Ids:**\n  - span_id=MigrationExecutor\n  - span_id=MigrationExecutor.apply_migration\n  - span_id=MigrationExecutor.record_migration\n  - span_id=MigrationRecorder.ensure_schema\n  - span_id=MigrationRecorder\n  - span_id=MigrationRecorder.record_applied\n  - span_id=ConnectionRouter\n  - span_id=ConnectionRouter.allow_migrate\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **span_id=MigrationExecutor:**\n  This represents the MigrationExecutor class, which is responsible for loading and executing migrations, making it relevant because it ensures consistent execution across all migration actions.\n  \n- **span_id=MigrationExecutor.apply_migration:**\n  This method runs a migration forward.

Understanding the candidate patch:\n\n- **Modified hunks:**\n  - Modified the `ensure_schema` method in `django/db/migrations/recorder.py`\n    \n<patch_exp>\n1. Add TODO comments inside the `ensure_schema` method in the `MigrationRecorder` class.\n   \n2. These TODO comments repeatedly state, \"Add a check for whether migrations are allowed on this database\" but are not functional implementations, introducing no logic change, just multiple non-operative comments.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check correct location:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is touching the correct function where table creation logic resides, but it is only adding non-operative comments instead of functional changes needed to resolve the issue involving the `db_router`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check for new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any actively new code or logic, thus it should introduce any new issues. However, the multiple TODO comments might confuse developers, which is redundant and irrelevant to functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fails to address the symptoms highlighted in the Github issue. It adds multiple repeated non-functional TODO comments to `ensure_schema` without implementing the actual migration checks based on `db_router`, making it entirely ineffective for solving the problem.\n\n1. Repetitive Code: Adds excessive multiple TODO comments that gridlocking progression.\n2. Incorrect API Usage: While no operational API usage exists, adding non-implementing one creates no effect or improvement.\n3. Overlooking Edge cases: All of the core logic laid unaddressed regarding respecting routings that must halt whenever migration creation on incorrect databases happens.\nSo, the patch as it stands does not provide any solution.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
