Modification in `array.py` file from line 31 \n   - The patch adds logic to check if the default value is a method from a nested class and adjusts the string reference accordingly before calling the constructor.\n2. Modification in `array.py` file from line 147\n   - Similar logic as the first modification in another method to trek nested methods as defaults and adjust class references addressing any more specifics.\n3. Modification in line 244 of `__init__.py`:\n   - Adds logic within the field initializer to handle the translation of nested class methods detecting and resetting accurately.\n4. `__init__`.py file addition at line 981\n   - Adds handling in the pre-save step to transform nested method defaults into correct string values suitable for migrations.\n5. `__init__`.py file, line 1024:\n   - Ensures during `get_default`, formation/logical issue noted for nested class methods being referenced, correcting string wise formulation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch seems to

These include the `__init__` method and method associated with serialization in migrations operations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Check for New Issues Introduction\n<new_issues_exp>\nInitially, it does not look like this patch conflicts directly with the provided code segments. It uses the paths to check the references of nested class methods, which deals appropriately with the given edge case without affecting any unrelated functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Fix Issue Quality Check\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce outright new issues because it directly addresses how defaults from nested class methods are referenced and corrected for serialization. However, the approach is somewhat repetitive, having similar logic added multiple times. Additionally:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: There's notable repetition regarding fixing default method references in different parts of logic \u2013 the same conditional structure cropped multiple times.\n2. **Incorrect API usage** and **Handling Edge Cases**: Appears sufficient and consistent, ensuring validation covers the whole span of method types.\n\nWhile useful, it would be better designed utilizing a helper utility so the check and conversion done aren't replicated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>8</score>"

It is relevant because the issue is with the default value assignment to the `ArrayField`, where the nested class method isn't serialized correctly.\n\n2. **ArrayField.__init__**: Describes initialization of the `ArrayField`. It affects how default values interact with the field on initialization.\n\n3. **MigrationWriter.as_string**: Transforms migration instances into migration file strings. It's important as it handles how fields and their defaults are serialized into migration files.\n\n4. **MigrationWriter**: Contains overarching logic that manages converting migrations to string format.\n\n5. **OperationWriter**: Handles individual operations serialization, including migrations.AddField, which is significant here because it's responsible for serializing the default function values.\n\n6. **OperationWriter.serialize**: Method within OperationWriter to handle arguments, which include field defaults.\n\n7. **Field._get_default**: Returns the field\u2019s default value if available. This affects how the default is applied in practice.\n\n8. **Field.__init__**: Describes initialization of Django Model fields more generally, playing a role in setting defaults.\n\n9. **Field.get_default**: Method to retrieve default values for fields. \n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk modifying FunctionTypeSerializer in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **FunctionTypeSerializer Modification**: \n   - **Before**:\n    ```python\n    return \"%s.%s.%s\" % (module, klass.__name__, self.value.__name__), {\"import %s\" % module}\n    ```\n\n   - **After**:\n    ```python\n    return \"%s.%s.%s\" % (module, klass.__qualname__, self.value.__name__), {\"import %s\" % module}\n    ```\n\nThis modification changes how the names of classes are serialized. It updates from using `__name__` to `__qualname__`, ensuring that nested class names are fully qualified including their nesting structure.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the modified method `serialize` in `FunctionTypeSerializer` addresses the correct location because the issue with nested classes being incorrectly referenced is specifically due to how the nested class methods were getting serialized. Updating to `__qualname__` ensures correct and fully-qualified references.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new contradictions with any of the code spans identified. The patch itself is a minimal and targeted change to the `FunctionTypeSerializer` which should correctly serialize the fully qualified name of nested classes.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the issue by addressing the serialization format for nested classes, changing it to use `__qualname__` rather than just `__name__`. This will properly register the nested path, such as `Profile.Capability` vs. just `Capability`. However, it doesn\u2019t directly account for other potential special edge cases or APIs which rely on or derive from this logic.\nCommon Mistake Categories:\n- **Repetitive code**: The fix is a specific spot change, no significant repetition.\n- **Incorrect API usage**: It introduces no incompatible API changes\u2014uses built-in class properties.\n- **Overlooking edge cases**: The edge case directly mentioned (nested classes) is handled; unknown edge cases cannot be commented without further context.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

It enhances specificity by including the hierarchical position of the nested class, potentially resolving the identified problem by citing `Profile.Capability.default` rather than just `Capability.default`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Verification of fix location correctness:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `serialize` method within the `FunctionTypeSerializer`, which seems appropriate considering the goal is to adjust how callable default values\u2014including methods from classes\u2014are serialized. Adjusting the field value verification and serialization method aptly solves the issue located at how migration functions list and internally serialize/identify class representations and their methods.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Introduction of new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues in the context of `Field.default` since utilizing `__qualname__` ensures the fully qualified class-plus-function name, avoiding improper generic referencing. However, code spans focusing on generic fields and operation representation show no apparent contradiction owing to `String` fields composition or `big migration setups`, hence the modification doesn't clash sharable with these spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Verification of the patch fixing the core issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe enhanced serialization format by inserting `__qualname__` for more detailed hierarchical addressing should correctly generate migration references catered towards nested classes. However, spotting attempted cropping approaches solving hierarchical addressing at parsing. Notably, achieved embedded patches work consistently compared against `Field.params,uences` and less probable to reflect repetitive/mistakes cited, but yield until - rarely overlook.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
