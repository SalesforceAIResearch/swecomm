In contrast, this behavior is not present in Python 3.7. This likely occurs due to discrepancies in how statement line numbers are calculated between these Python versions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n - Span IDs: [AssertionRewritingHook, AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert]\n \n<code_span_exp>\n- `AssertionRewritingHook`: This class handles the code which rewrites assertions in pytest. It's relevant because its modifications affect the reporting and logging of pytest-going environments, potentially contributing to the misreported line numbers.\n- `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert`: This function processes `assert` statements.

If such nodes exist, their decorators' line numbers get appended to `values`. Rest of the statements maintain the previous check for `ast.stmt` or `ast.ExceptHandler`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct Function Check:**\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe added logic to account for decorators\u2019 line numbers seems appropriate for altering reported line numbers.
