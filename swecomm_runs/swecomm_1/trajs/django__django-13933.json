Currently, when raising a `ValidationError` for an invalid choice, the error message does not display the value of the invalid choice, unlike other fields such as `ChoiceField`. The proposal is to modify the error message for the `invalid_choice` code to include the invalid value.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue is that the `ModelChoiceField` class in Django does not include the specific invalid choice in its validation error message, which is less informative compared to other fields like `ChoiceField`. The proposed fix is to incorporate the invalid value into the error message when raising the validation error.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n   \n   - List of span ids:\n     - `ModelChoiceField`\n     - `ModelChoiceField.to_python`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `ModelChoiceField`: This is the class at the heart of the issue. It defines how the error messages are structured, notably the `invalid_choice` message that needs updating.\n- `ModelChoiceField.to_python`: This method is responsible for converting the input value and contains the logic where the validation error is raised for an invalid choice. The patch needs to modify this method to include the invalid value in the error message.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n   - List of modified hunks:\n     - Modification in `django/forms/models.py` at line 1287\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modification in `django/forms/models.py` adds `params={'value': value}` to the `ValidationError` raised in the `to_python` method of the `ModelChoiceField` class. This change enables the error message to include the specific invalid value.\n\nThe modified code thus changes the `ValidationError` initialization from:\n```python\nraise ValidationError(self.error_messages['invalid_choice'], code='invalid_choice')\n```\nto:\n```python\nraise ValidationError(\n    self.error_messages['invalid_choice'],\n    code='invalid_choice',\n    params={'value': value}\n)\n```\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\nThe patch is applied to the `to_python` method in the `ModelChoiceField`, the correct function where the `ValidationError` for an invalid choice is raised. This aligns with the issue's requirement to make the error message for invalid choices more informative by including the erroneous value.\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch correctly modifies the `to_python` method in the `ModelChoiceField` class, the correct location where the validation error is raised for invalid choices.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\nUpon review, it does not appear that the patch introduces new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans. The use of `params` in `ValidationError` is consistent with Django's API for error messages, meaning there shouldn't be any compatibility issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce new issues or contradictions with identified code spans. The usage of `params` in the `ValidationError` is correct according to Django\u2019s API.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\nThe patch appears to be well-formulated. It avoids the common mistakes made by LLMs:\n1. **Repetitive code**: It modifies existing logic without introducing redundancy.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: It uses the `params` argument in `ValidationError` correctly.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The inclusion of `params` should cover edge cases pertinent to validation errors, ensuring the invalid value is shown properly.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch effectively fixes the issue by modifying the `ValidationError` raised in the `to_python` method to include the invalid choice. It avoids the common mistakes of repetitive code and incorrect API usage while also addressing potential edge cases related to validation errors.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "1. Understand the issue.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about the `ModelChoiceField` class in Django, which does not provide the value of an invalid choice when raising a `ValidationError`. Unlike similar fields like `ChoiceField`, the error message for an invalid choice in `ModelChoiceField` doesn't show the problematic value. Updating the error message format to include the invalid value should address this concern.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans.\n\nSpan IDs:\n- ModelChoiceField\n- ModelChoiceField.to_python\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **ModelChoiceField**: This code span defines the main class `ModelChoiceField` and its associated error messages. The default error message for `invalid_choice` is stated here, which is currently not displaying the invalid value.\n- **ModelChoiceField.to_python**: This method in `ModelChoiceField` is responsible for validating and converting input values. It has a try-except block that catches invalid choices and raises a `ValidationError` when such a choice occurs. The issue lies in this span because the `ValidationError` raised here does not show the invalid value.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch.\n\nModified hunks:\n- Change to `ModelChoiceField` class\n- Change to `Handler inside to_python function`\n\n<patch_exp> \n- **ModelChoiceField**: The `default_error_messages` for the `invalid_choice` key has been updated to `'Select a valid choice. %(value)s is not one of the available choices.'`, so that it now includes the invalid `(value)` placeholder.\n- **Handler inside to_python function**: The `raise ValidationError` statement is updated to include the parameter `params={'value': value}`, so that when the validation error is raised, it will include the invalid value in the error message.\n</patch_exp> \n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is changing the correct locations in the `ModelChoiceField` class. Specifically, it updates the default error message and modifies the `to_python` method where the `ValidationError` is raised.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It correctly accounts for the need to include the invalid value in the error message and does not contradict with the identified code spans. It maintains the intended functionality and improves error reporting.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue effectively by correctly updating the `invalid_choice` error message to include the invalid value and ensures that this value is included when raising a `ValidationError` in the `to_python` method. The patch does not suffer from repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or overlooking edge cases in this context.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
