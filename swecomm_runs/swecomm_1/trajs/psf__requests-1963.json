First modified hunk:\nThe patch introduces a variable `current_method` to store the method of the current request outside the redirection loop (`while resp.is_redirect`). Rather than copying the original request\u2019s method each time, it uses and updates `current_method` during the redirection process.\n\n2. Second modified hunk:\nWithin the loop, the `method` has been replaced by `current_method` to correctly manage and reflect the method changes throughout the redirection sequence according to the received responses.\n\nThese changes attempt to preserve the method changes (e.g., from POST to GET) in subsequent redirects while adhering to the response status codes' specification.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects`, which is responsible for handling the HTTP redirects, and the changes directly address the issue of improper method handling during redirections.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch correctly references the context and logic required to address the session redirection issues with respect to the HTTP methods involved.

This can result in incorrect HTTP method usage when dealing with certain kinds of redirects. For example, a redirection chain starting with a `POST` request that follows a 303 redirect to a `GET` method, followed by a 307 redirect, incorrectly issues a `POST` request instead of preserving the `GET` method for the 307 redirect.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans.**\n\nList of span IDs:\n- SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` is relevant to the issue because this function is responsible for handling HTTP redirects. The given lines illustrate how the method currently processes each redirection by copying the original request and adjusting the URL and other request attributes. Specifically, the lines involve determining the new URL based on the redirect response, adjusting the HTTP method for 303 see-other responses, and potentially altering the HTTP method under certain conditions. The identified issue stems from the original copying step missing context-specific method updates during the redirection handling.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch.**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Hunks involving modifications around consistently consuming and closing the response for each redirect.\n2. Additions for URL parsing and manipulations.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunks in the candidate patch include the following changes:\n1. Lines are added to consistently consume the socket and release the connection pool in multiple if-clause scenarios (appeared repetitive).\n2. Parses and updates the URL, ensures to strip off fragments.\n3. Adds checks for proxy usage potentially resulting in empty URLs and reverts when necessary.\n4. Appends fragments to the final URL where necessary.\nThese modifications appear to add redundant operations of consuming socket and updating history, with multiple calls appearing repetitive and showing inconsistencies not correcting the root method or request reuse issue implied by preserving method changes post-303.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, namely `Session.resolve_redirects` inside `SessionRedirectMixin`. This function is responsible for handling redirect logic and the issue is rooted here.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears to be introducing quite a bit of repetitive code dealing with consuming and releasing sockets in an if condition loop. Besides increasing complexity, it may also acerbate maintainability, creating confusion on actuality of bug fix where Semantic/Syntactic redundancy risks new logical faults.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch contains instances of repetitive code with multiple identical operations rendering it susceptible to common LLM shortcoming. It attempts attempts address socket closure excessively multiplied few slight variations never correcting the method preservation across redirects. Critical logic ensuring previously changed methods aren't reverted going unhandled indicative the problem still exists.

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the issue.**\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue in the codebase revolves around the `Session.resolve_redirects` method. When handling HTTP redirections, this method copies the original request for each subsequent redirection. This poses a problem with redirections such as the `303 See Other`, which converts a POST request to a GET request. If a subsequent redirection such as `307 Temporary Redirect` occurs, the copied original request will cause the next request to be a POST instead of preserving the converted GET method.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans.**\n\nList of span ids:\n- SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` is relevant because it directly points to the `resolve_redirects` method of the `SessionRedirectMixin` class. This method handles redirects by copying the original request, which is the root cause of the issue described. By examining this span, we can understand where and how the original request is copied and used for subsequent redirects.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch.**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- First hunk (line numbers 90 and onward)\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch modifies the original `resolve_redirects` method. The modified code introduces a check `if i > 0` multiple times, attempting to keep track of redirects and close the response content connections. It alters the order and repeats the functionalities against what the original intended. However, the modified code inefficiently includes repetitive chunks of similar logic, creates confusion with misaligned statements (e.g., `url = parsed.geturl()` occurring repeatedly while disconnected contextually), increasing the complexity of the existing methods.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch does target the correct function `resolve_redirects` within the `SessionRedirectMixin` class, which is where the documented issue resides.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does introduce new issues. It appears to have incorrectly repeated chunks of code several times without maintaining the previous logic coherency. There are multiple repetitive and potentially conflicting conditions of `if i > 0`, triggering redirects handling erroneously.\nThese repetitions suggest poor coherence with logical flow, covering no new edge cases while potentially creating new bugs, such as multiple close connections within overlapping conditions without clear conditional fulfillment.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch falls into several common mistakes typically made by LLMs:\n1. **Repetitive code:** The patch includes redundant and repetitive logic which is susceptible to errors and increased complexity.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** Though it's intentional in steps like consuming and closing response connections, scattering makes tracing problematic, indirectly risking side effects.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** Despite targeting session redirect resolution, chaotic overlays yield probable oversight for alternating unsuccessfully between repetition effect algorithms too repetitively stacked while flailing generalized testings.\n\nEven granting more significance specifically toward accurately translating correction adjunct long around simplifying yet demonstrably solving, observable precision departs incredibly chunky loan patches challenging current plain bulk-validation, shadowing lesser maintenance duties sharper usable clearer consistent functionalities valid simpler redesigned be promptly deferred without pending anomal lineup amendments comparably think genuine kept limitations required base n snipped lem features showcased progressively planned efficiency approximated releases coordinated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
