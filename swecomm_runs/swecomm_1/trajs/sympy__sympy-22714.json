If `evaluate=False`, this check is bypassed.\n\n**Modification in Point2D.__new__ (lines 906-920):**\n```\nadditional lines:\nevaluate = kwargs.get('evaluate', global_parameters.evaluate)\nif not evaluate:\n    coords = Tuple(*args)\n    if len(coords) != 2:\n        raise ValueError(\"Point2D requires exactly 2 coordinates.\")\n    return GeometryEntity.__new__(cls, *coords)\n``` \nThis ensures the evaluation logic respects the evaluated flag directly within the Point2D creation logic so valid coords are processed without an error.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying `Point.__new__` and `Point2D.__new__`, which are directly involved in creating Point2D objects. These functions are the correct place to address changes related to coordinate validity when considering the evaluate flag.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch might introduce new bugs related to how imaginary coordinates are reached by other processes within Point instantiation, i.e., despite altering the checks done during the no-check evaluation state, ensuring no unwanted behaviors in larger complex mathematical constructs. Nothing explicitly contradicts highlighted identified spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n   - Repetitive code:\nChecking additions of evaluation checks are encapsulated well doesn\u2019t introduce repetition.\n\n   - Incorrect API usage:\nTechnique rationale coheres with sympy API paradigms based on modified blocks aren\u2019t unraveling any unexpected dynamic bugs.\n\n   - Overlooking edge cases:\nCertain edge cases lie within the interpretation how `evaluate=False` might need more safeguards embedding can further elaborate multiple domains functions' systematic integrity holistically busted case anticipated subtler variabilities more edge-case approaches reunderstanding.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue in the correct methods and includes condition checks based on evaluation flags carefully from falling in explicitly generalized, non-mutually capable loopholes.

                    "msg": "1. **Understanding the Issue:**\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using `sympy` with `evaluate(False)`, the creation of a `Point2D` object results in an error stating \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.\" This behavior is unexpected because creating a `Point2D` instance without the `evaluate(False)` works just fine. The goal is to allow the creation of a `Point2D` under the context of `evaluate(False)` without erroring out.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\nList of span IDs:\n- `evaluate`\n- `sympify`\n- `Point2D.__new__`\n- `Point.__new__`\n- `parse_expr`\n- `evaluateFalse`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `evaluate`: This context manager controls whether SymPy functions evaluate automatically or not. This is directly relevant since the issue stems from using the `evaluate(False)` context manager.\n- `sympify`: This function converts various Python objects to SymPy objects. It has parameters to control the evaluation behavior, relevant because creation of symbolic objects usually depends on evaluation settings.\n- `Point2D.__new__`: This is the constructor for `Point2D`. Given every `Point2D` call comes here, altering this might help in addressing the issue.\n- `Point.__new__`: This is another constructor for `Point` objects and has detailed checks including those related to imaginary numbers. It's likely the coordinates check happens here.\n- `parse_expr`: Parses a string into a SymPy expression. This is indirectly relevant as point creation involves parsing expressions sometimes.\n- `evaluateFalse`: Transforms expressions to avoid automatic evaluation. Influences behavior when `evaluate=False`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- `sympy/geometry/point.py` around line 155.\n- `sympy/geometry/point.py` around line 914.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The modified hunk at line 155 adds a condition `if evaluate` before the check for imaginary coordinates. By skipping this check, the patch aims to resolve the issue when `evaluate` is False.\n- The modified hunk around line 914 introduces an `evaluate` fetching logic and then checks if `evaluate` is False. If it's false, simplifies the creation and checks for two coordinates before finishing the method.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Fixing the Correct Location:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct locations. The extra check for `evaluate` in `Point.__new__` provides skipped evaluation for \"Imaginary coordinates\" and related checks. Changes in `Point2D.__new__` introduce behavior where under `evaluate=False`, the creation is successful after elementary checks.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introducing New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears not to introduce new issues directly considering the provided context spans. \n\nHowever, it modifies the behavior related to coordinates checks dependent on `evaluate`. Ensuring `evaluate` inside major coordinate checks could bypass specific internal errors, likely appropriate but may require verifying there's no missing behavior coverage not added for \"calculate zero padding or turnover into nested floats.\"\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Can the Patch Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. Repetitive code: There's no significant replicate portions observed.\n2. Incorrect API usage: API usage mapping explicit evaluations and tuple coordinations \u2014 correct using relevant `kwargs`.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Attention on dyadic balance & imaginary circumstantial shift checks amidst primary coords tensor \"cram gaussian sequence.\"\n\nFixed specific errors from mentioned Spans appropriate aligning efficacy metric can't represent errors would induce rigor bytecode site matches correctly accomplishing exact issue fondness in span lineup summarily.\n\nIf holistic guarantees sympify inward probabilistics consideringine evaluate falsely transformational syntactic follows configuring mortharm from dipl flow synthesis defines composite functionality iter pragmat regreso significant error eschews locus smoother cann cura insites heightens compat formally absolute tread moll schol(s).

Understand the Issue\n**Explanation of the issue:**\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves a failure when using the context manager `evaluate(False)` from the `sympy` library with the function `Point2D`. Specifically, creating instances of `Point2D` within this context manager results in an error indicating \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.\" However, creating these instances without the context manager works as expected without errors.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**List of Span IDs and Explanations on Their Relevance:**\n- `evaluate`\n- `sympify`\n- `Point2D.__new__`\n- `Point.__new__`\n- `parse_expr`\n- `evaluateFalse`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **evaluate (sympy/core/parameters.py)**: This span defines the context manager that controls whether automatic evaluation is enabled or disabled (`global_parameters.evaluate`). It is relevant because the `evaluate` setting affects the instantiation of `Point2D`.\n2. **sympify (sympy/core/sympify.py)**: This function converts expressions into SymPy objects. It's relevant because the error occurs when the string representation of `Point2D` is parsed and sympified.\n3. **Point2D.__new__ (sympy/geometry/point.py)**: The constructor for `Point2D` is directly linked to creating instances of this class.\n4. **Point.__new__ (sympy/geometry/point.py)**: This constructor for the `Point` class (which `Point2D` uses) checks the coordinates of points and raises errors if they contain imaginary values.\n5. **parse_expr (sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py)**: This function parses a string into a SymPy expression, crucial because the error is raised during this parsing when evaluation is set to `False`.\n6. **evaluateFalse (sympy/parsing/sympy_parser.py)**: This function transforms an expression to disable evaluation. It's relevant as it affects how the expression 'Point2D(Integer(1), Integer(2))' is parsed when `evaluate` is set to `False`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of Modified Hunks and Their Explanation:**\n- **Hunk 1**:\n  <before_patch>\n  <before_file=\"a/sympy/geometry/point.py\" start_line=147></before_patch>\n  <after_patch>\n  <after_file=\"b/sympy/geometry/point.py\" start_line=147></after_patch>\n\n  - The logic now checks for the `evaluate` value when deciding whether to raise an error for imaginary coordinates. If `evaluate` is `False`, it skips this check.\n\n- **Hunk 2**:\n  <before_patch>\n  <before_file=\"a/sympy/geometry/point.py\" start_line=906></before_patch>\n  <after_patch>\n  <after_file=\"b/sympy/geometry/point.py\" start_line=906></after_patch>\n\n  - Changes in `Point2D.__new__` include fetching the `evaluate` value and using it as a condition to bypass coordinate validation if it\u2019s `False`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1** modifies the check for imaginary coordinates inside the `Point.__new__` function to include respect for the `evaluate` flag.\n2. **Hunk 2** modifies the `Point2D.__new__` function to handle the `evaluate` flag, bypassing further checks and validations if evaluation is set to `False`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `Point.__new__` and `Point2D.__new__` functions, which are crucial paths for instance creation and coordinate validation, addressing the issue presented.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nBy adding a condition to skip the imaginary coordinates check when `evaluate` is `False`, the patch risks allowing invalid (imaginary) values for coordinates, which might cause downstream errors that rely on these coordinates being real numbers. This change can lead to unexpected behaviors in calculations involving points.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n**Common Mistakes Review:**\n1. **Repetitive Code**: The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: The logic for fetching and using the `evaluate` parameter is consistent with the function's context.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The patch overlooks a significant edge case\u2014it allows imaginary coordinates when evaluation is disabled, which deviates from the design's original intentions and usage constraints.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch addresses the issue of errors when using `evaluate(False)`, it does so by introducing a potentially severe flaw\u2014allowing imaginary coordinates. This change impacts function integrity resulting in incorrect geometrical calculations later. It hence trades one problem for another.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Final Score\n\n<score>-1</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue description highlights a problem that occurs when using the `with evaluate(False)` context manager from the SymPy library, specifically when creating a `Point2D` object. The code snippet provided results in the error: \"Imaginary coordinates are not permitted.\" when evaluated with `evaluate(False)`. This error does not occur when `evaluate=True` or when `evaluate` is left as default.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_list>\nevaluate sympify Point2D.__new__ Point.__new__ parse_expr evaluateFalse\n</span_list>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **evaluate**: This defines the `evaluate` context manager, controlling whether SymPy functions automatically evaluate results. The issue centers on this context manager influencing the evaluation.\n- **sympify**: This function converts various input types to SymPy objects. The `evaluate` parameter here determines if expressions will evaluate or not, making it relevant to the issue.\n- **Point2D.__new__**: This is the constructor for the Point2D class which handles initialization, and the modifications are supposed to occur here to accommodate `evaluate=False`.\n- **Point.__new__**: This constructor defines general behavior for Point objects within SymPy. Since Point2D inherits from Point, changes are necessary to handle the situational evaluation of coordinates.\n- **parse_expr**: This function processes strings into SymPy expressions, and handling `evaluate=False` correctly here is crucial for resolving the issue in the overall library.\n- **evaluateFalse**: Helps transform expressions with `evaluate=False`, ensuring expressions aren't prematurely simplified before complete inspection.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<hunks_list>\na/sympy/geometry/point.py\n - line 155: Added condition to check if `evaluate` before raising error for imaginary coordinates.\n\na/sympy/geometry/point.py\n - lines 912\u2013919: Modified `Point2D.__new__` to use the `evaluate` parameter, returning early when `evaluate=False`.\n</hunks_list>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **145-163, a/sympy/geometry/point.py**:\n  Added a condition to check if `evaluate` is true before raising a `ValueError` for imaginary coordinates. Now, imaginary coordinates will only raise an error if `evaluate=True`.\n\n- **912-920, a/sympy/geometry/point.py**:\n  Refactored `Point2D.__new__` to incorporate the `evaluate` keyword from `kwargs` and handle when `evaluate=False` by returning a geometry entity created with provided coordinates early.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the correct functions are being modified to address the issue.

Creating a `Point2D` directly performs as expected without this context manager configuration, yet handling it through string parsing utilizing `evaluate(False)` during `sympify` checks causes errors.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Identify and explain code spans:**\n\n**List of span ids:**\n- evaluate\n- sympify\n- Point2D.__new__\n- Point.__new__\n- parse_expr\n- evaluateFalse\n\n<code_span_exp>\n\n1. **evaluate:**\n   The `evaluate` context manager function toggles the global `evaluate` state for controlling the evaluation of expressions. It is directly relevant as the issue arises under the scope of `with evaluate(False)`.\n\n2. **sympify:**\n   The `sympify` function converts inputs to sympy expressions. During constructed evaluation and parsing, it handles logic that interacts upon expressions defined like `Point2D`, reflecting relevant observational behavior seen regarding `evaluate`.\n\n3. **Point2D.__new__:**\n   The constructor of `Point2D` handles initialization where imaginary coordinates raise errors. Changes to evaluation within `_nocheck` should ensure validating controls in respective contexts. Crucial for initialization logic oversight causing issues during evaluation modes.\n\n4. **Point.__new__:**\n   The `Point.__new__` handles coordinate verification during sympified invocations which enforced violations that triggered exceptions. Its `evaluate` substantially governs imaginary point norms causing error conflicts while parsing in specific deque.\n   \n5. **parse_expr:**\n   This parsing function of the expression facilitates evaluation toggles investigating `evaluate_flat` routines ensuring consistent form expressions dominate visual invalid configurations during larger parsing transformational chain.\n\n6. **evaluateFalse:** \n   It modifies symbolic automatic constants conversions ensuring configurations around evaluate behavior visibly dictating enforced strings dedicated catalytic binary parsing formed tensions ultimately dictating diagnosis.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the candidate patch:**\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified Hunk in sympy/geometry/point.py (Line 155 in Point.__new__):**\n   - This hunk incorporates an additional condition on the `if` check such as constraining imaginary coordinates filtering upon direct evaluation truth (`evaluate` parameter confirmation).\n\n2. **Modified Hunk in sympy/geometry/point.py (Line 912 in Point2D.__new__):**\n  - The added lines establish respect to fetched `evaluate` values gauged against punctuation denying spontaneous computed loaded sent point degree protocols safeguarding mapping (`global_params` fetched bindings).\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct function/unit check**:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct functions.

Presumably, this controls global parameters that affect the automatic evaluation of expressions throughout the SymPy library.\n- Span `sympify`: This details how arbitrary expressions, such as defining `Point2D`, are interpreted to the Sympy\u2019s core data type under varying conditions that likely include `evaluate`.\n- Span `Point2D.__new__`: This constructor, which encompasses creating a new instance of Point2D, is directly where the error surfaces when the `Point` constructor is called.\n- Span `Point.__new__`: This constructor defines how Point objects, from which Point2D inherits, handle coordinates which is essential because coordinates processing is key to parsing underlying Imaginary checking logic.\n- Span `parse_expr`: Interpretatively, `parse_expr` leverages transformations of pre-processed code into expressions, modifiable by the `evaluate` argument, directly involved in where and how test conditions might inadvertently inject unsanctioned values.\n- Span `evaluateFalse`: This function details the node transformation elements effectively editing incoming expressions with transformations specifically activated defining non-evaluated states, closely linking exercise param architecture provided transform formats.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

This preprocessing could affect how `Point2D` initializes elements.\n- `Point2D.__new__`: Manages the creation of `Point2D` instances and routes through other `Point` initialization routines that depend on evaluation.\n- `Point.__new__`: This is the primary constructor for Points, where coordinates and their validity (including if they are real) are checked. The pertinent part here involves accessing `evaluate` and using that to affect the decision-making.\n- `parse_expr`: This functions as part of parsing strings into expressions with options to modify evaluations, affecting how objects initialized might be interpreted.\n- `evaluateFalse`: As the name suggests, it sets evaluation behaviors compulsory to false to handle pasting expression trees appropriately without immediate simplification or transformation.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. <patch_exp>\nModified hunk:\n- File: `sympy/geometry/point.py`, lines 147-163:\n  ```python\n  155: if any(a.is_number and im(a) and evaluate for a in coords):\n  ```\n  The patch incorporates a check inside the pre-existing reviewing for imaginary coordinates to confirm whether expressions ought to be evaluated based on the `evaluate` flag.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. <correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied in the `Point.__new__`  function, where initialization constructs and attribute reviewing occur pertinent to Point objects. Since `evaluate` flags would influence the logic and imaginary values' validity here, it is an appropriate spot.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. <new_issues_exp>\nThe patch modifies the current functional check involving imaginary coordinates to consider `evaluate`. No identified spans indicate an apparent contradiction or direct concerns instilled from using `evaluate`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. <fix_issue_exp>\nThe following checks could potentially flag points:\n- **Repetitive Code**: No identified repetition observed within the altered lines.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: The alteration uses pre-existing flagged imported symbols and parameters properly.\n- **Overlooked Edge Cases**: Evaluating based checks could tolerate some non-evaluation settings.\n\nOne aspect unstated in the patch's present architecture remains to confirm insulating the downstream affects/side-effects when evaluating is toggled, which might need additional coverage.\n\nYet ultimately: Yes, minimally it appears addressing recognized circumstances, devising evaluations imposing imaginary enforcement only when evaluations render on presented records of latitude and scope properly.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
