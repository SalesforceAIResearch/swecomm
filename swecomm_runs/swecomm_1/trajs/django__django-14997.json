Code change in `def _remake_table` between lines 233 and 256, adding filtered constraints to single out unique constraints with expressions temporarily.\n2.

It introduces an additional check inside the for-loop that iterates over column aliases. It checks if the column alias is present and only then updates it with the new table. This appears to ensure proper handling of expressions during table renames.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe modification to `rename_table_references` seems relevant as this is a part that deals with renaming tables which could include expressions. However, given the span suggestions, the fix might also need specific changes in the `_remake_table` method of `DatabaseSchemaEditor` or changes in constraint handling in `UniqueConstraint`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo direct contradictions or new issues introduced in the provided identify code spans were observed. It appears that additional checks can potentially ensure more robust handling but doesn\u2019t eliminate the root cause involving constraints evaluation in SQLite.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does address part of the renaming mechanism but lacks alterations in places where `DatabaseSchemaEditor` processes constraints for remade tables. There is a potential overcoming redundancy with Ltd, as it handles expressions in the rename process for attributes, but deeper modifications might be needed within schema editor specifications, particularly when SQLite backend constraints evaluation fails.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nGiven these considerations, even though the patch doesn't introduce new issues, its implementation might insufficiently address the core problem as the critical methods directly involved with applying constraints, `_remake_table` and `constraints.py`, weren\u2019t modified.\n\n<score>5</score>"

The process also involves considering referenced foreign keys that may need to be handled explicitly.\n3. `DatabaseSchemaEditor`: Defines the base schema editor class for SQLite, includes SQL templates and other overarching migration-related functions and fields.\n4. `UniqueConstraint`: This class, part of Django\u2019s migration constructs, specifies unique constraints that hold at the database level. This directly relates to how constraints are enforced on the SQLite backend.\n5. `UniqueConstraint.__init__`: The constructor sets up the UniqueConstraint with expressions, fields, and validation checks critical to ensuring constraints are properly defined and created.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Modified hunk 1:\n  ```diff\n  --- a/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\n  +++ b/django/db/backends/ddl_references.py\n  @@ -210,11 +210,12 @@\n  def rename_table_references(self, old_table, new_table):\n      if self.table != old_table:\n          return\n      expressions = deepcopy(self.expressions)\n      self.columns = []\n  for col in self.compiler.query._gen_cols([expressions]):\n      +             if col.alias:\n          col.alias = new_table\n      self.expressions = expressions\n      super().rename_table_references(old_table, new_table)\n  ```\n  This patch adds a check within `rename_table_references` to ensure that the alias is only modified if it is set (i.e., not None or empty). \n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies a method in `django/db/backends/ddl_references.py` that is likely crucial for handling table references correctly, thereby addressing part of the issue given that problematic constraint generation may tie back to how references are resolved and adjusted during migrations involving unique constraints.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no obvious signs showing conflicting logic with the identified code spans.
