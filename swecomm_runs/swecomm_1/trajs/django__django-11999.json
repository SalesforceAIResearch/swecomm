Understanding the identified code spans:\n- List of span ids: `Model._get_FIELD_display`, `Field.contribute_to_class`\n- <code_span_exp>\n  - **Model._get_FIELD_display**:\n    The `_get_FIELD_display` is a method that retrieves and returns the display value for a field based on `choices`. This is the underlying method being accessed when users call `get_FIELD_display`.\n  - **Field.contribute_to_class**:\n    This function registers fields with a model class and, particularly relevant here, sets up the default `get_FIELD_display` method for fields with choices.

Correct function identification:\n- <correct_location_exp>:\n  - The patch has been applied to the correct function `contribute_to_class`. This function is responsible for registering fields and setting up related methods such as `get_FIELD_display`. Modifying the behavior here directly relates to the issue of overriding the display methods.\n\n5. Introduction of new issues:\n- <new_issues_exp>:\n  - The patch does not seem to introduce new issues. It simply adds a condition to ensure that it doesn't overwrite a pre-existing `get_%s_display` method, which aligns with user needs without conflicting with identified code spans.\n\n6. Effectiveness of the patch:\n- <fix_issue_exp>:\n  - The patch appears to fix the issue effectively by including a condition to avoid overwriting a user-defined `get_FIELD_display` method.

Any logic here would naturally influence whether custom overrides are respected.\n\n   <code_span_exp>\n   - `Model._get_FIELD_display`: This is where the field's display value is determined from choices. Understanding this helps identify if and how it interacts with overrides.\n   - `Field.contribute_to_class`: This handles adding fields to model classes and setting up the `get_FIELD_display` method. Key in understanding how the default method could supersede overrides.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n   - List of modified hunks:\n     - Hunk in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py` from line 765 to line 768\n\n   - Explanation:\n     - **Hunk 1**: Introduces a check to see if the class already has a method named `get_FIELD_display` specific to the field before setting it up using `partialmethod`. Only if the method is not present, it will add the method using default behaviors.\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - The patch introduces a condition to check for the existence of `get_FIELD_display` specific to the field before adding the default method. This change ensures custom methods aren\u2019t overridden by Django's default behavior.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**:\n   - Indeed, the patch modifies `Field.contribute_to_class`, which is precisely where the `get_FIELD_display` method is set. Given the identified relevant code spans, this is the correct place for this patch.\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   The patch is applied in the correct function, within `Field.contribute_to_class`, where the method `get_FIELD_display` is setup.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n   - There doesn't seem to be any oversight about introducing new issues. The check `hasattr` for `get_FIELD_display` simply preserves any previously defined custom method and only applies the default if no custom method is found.\n   \n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch does not introduce any new issues and appropriately preserves already existing custom methods for `get_FIELD_display`.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n   - The patch appears to correctly address the core issue by ensuring custom overrides aren\u2019t replaced by default behavior.\n   - The logic doesn\u2019t repeat any redundant computations and makes use of the `partialmethod` construct consistently.\n   - While the patch checks for `get_FIELD_display` existence, it doesn\u2019t incorrectly employ API usage.\n   - The patch does not explicitly overlook any immediate edge cases related to the issue as described. Though, considerations like multiple inheritance in models or inherited methods may still stand as potential edge cases. Nonetheless, giving the context, these edge concerns look sufficiently contained within the fix.\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch actively fixes the issue by ensuring pre-existing custom `get_FIELD_display` methods aren't overridden. It avoids the common mistake of introducing repetitive, incorrect, or edge-case oversight logic.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n    \n7. **Score**:\n   Given: \n   - The patch effectively addresses the issue.\n   - The focus stays correct without introducing further concerns.\n\n   <score>10</score>"

Field.contribute_to_class\n\nThe `Model._get_FIELD_display` function is important because it describes how the display value for a field is resolved based on choices if defined.\n\nThe `Field.contribute_to_class` method contributes the specified field to the parent model class, and it is where the `get_FIELD_display` method is set when the field has choices. This is directly responsible for overwriting the custom `get_<field>_display` methods in models when they shouldn't be.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modify the logic that sets `get_<field>_display` method only if not already present:\n   ```\n   if self.choices is not None:\n       if not hasattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name):\n           setattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name,\n                   partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self))\n   ```\n\nThe patch adds a check to see if `get_<field>_display` is already defined on the class before setting it with the `_get_FIELD_display` partial method.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `Field.contribute_to_class` in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`. This function is responsible for setting the `get_FIELD_display` method, which is key to the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces no visible new issues and correctly checks if the method `get_<field>_display` already exists before establishing the default one from the field definition with choices. This ensures that user-defined methods do not get overridden inadvertently.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by adding a check to see if `get_<field>_display` is already present before setting it with the default implementation. There is no repetitive code introduced. The API is used correctly by checking with `hasattr()`. The edge cases concerning user-defined methods are properly handled.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
