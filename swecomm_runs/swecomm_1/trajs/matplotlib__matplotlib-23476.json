This unintended behavior can, over iterations, lead to very high DPI values and cause an `OverflowError`, since the DPI would eventually exceed the maximum limits for an integer.\n\n<issue_exp>The DPI of a figure doubles upon each unpickle operation on M1 Mac, potentially leading to an OverflowError due to excessively high DPI values.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- List of span IDs: `FigureCanvasMac.resize`, `FigureCanvasMac`, `Figure:7`, `Figure.__setstate__`, `Figure.__getstate__`\n\n- Explanation of relevance:\n  - **`FigureCanvasMac.resize` and `FigureCanvasMac`**: These deal with figure resizing on Mac, which directly interacts with DPI and screen resolution scaling. This can be relevant as adjustments here could be contributing to or demonstrating the DPI modification behavior.\n  \n  - **`Figure:7`**: This deals with setting or getting DPI values within the figure class properties. It\u2019s central to understanding how DPI is managed within the figure object.\n\n  - **`Figure.__setstate__` and `Figure.__getstate__`**: These involve the pickling and unpickling process of the figure.
