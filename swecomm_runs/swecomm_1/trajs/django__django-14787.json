Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch preserves the function's original attributes by introducing a correctly annotated `@wraps(method)` on the nested `bound_method`. This resolves missing expected function attributes (`__name__`, `__module__`, etc.). However, introducing a nested function can occasionally have unoptimized or over-engineered implications, though it appears fit for purpose here. The common mistakes checks:\n1. The repetition is avoided by managing binding in one closure.\n2. API usage (particularly with `partial`, `wraps` and `decorators`) looks correct.\n3. Edge cases (function attribute retainment, compared variable levels) are both adequately handled.\n\nOverall, the patch doesn't seem to have significant pitfalls according to these considerations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

This results in wrapped functions (e.g., partial objects) not having necessary attributes like `__name__`, leading to an `AttributeError` when such attributes are accessed.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n- List of span IDs: `_multi_decorate`, `_update_method_wrapper`, `method_decorator`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe `_multi_decorate` code span defines the primary decorator logic where the methods are wrapped and decorated, which is relevant because the issue directly impacts the attributes preservation in this wrapping process. \n\nThe `_update_method_wrapper` code span handles copying the attributes from the decorator wrappers to the actual wrapper methods. This is crucial since the issue concerns the preservation of attributes like `__name__`.\n\nThe `method_decorator` code span converts a function decorator into a method decorator. This function uses `_multi_decorate`, thus showing the connection and relevance of this function to the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n- Modified hunks:\n  - Lines 35-55 in `django/utils/decorators.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch refactors the `_wrapper` function within `_multi_decorate`. The revised `_wrapper` function now defines a local `bound_method` using the `wraps` decorator to preserve the attributes from `method`. It then applies any additional decorators to the `bound_method`. Finally, the outer `_wrapper` applies all expected method attributes using `update_wrapper` before returning the decorated method.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function.

Using the `wraps` decorator inside the `bound_method` ensures attributes like `__name__` and `__module__` are preserved correctly. Additionally, the patch does not introduce repetitive code, correctly uses `wraps` and `update_wrapper` API, and seems to handle all existing attribute-related cases adequately.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final score**\n\n<score>9</score>"

The first (and only) modified hunk at line 41 adds an `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` call. This is aimed at preserving important attributes from the original `method` to the `bound_method` even after it is converted to a `functools.partial` object.\n</patch_exp>\n\n\n4. **Correct Location Evaluation:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modification is applied inside the function `_multi_decorate` that is responsible for applying decorators to methods and creating the partial function, which is where the problem of lost attributes arises.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n\n5. **Evaluation for New issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues directly. However, the call to `update_wrapper` inside the loop might technically contradict the principles laid out in `_update_method_wrapper`, where updates are tailored per decorator level, but incorporating the update-wrapper method externally for broader usage should be harmonious if used correctly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n\n6. **Patch Effectiveness Analysis:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the attribute preservation issue by using `update_wrapper` to copy crucial method attributes back to the `partial` object. On evaluation:\n\n- **Repetitive Code**: The code does not add unnecessary repetition.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` appears correctly used.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Edge cases seem well-handled since attributes directly correlate with source method. `update_wrapper` is well-placed just after `partial` to avoid enclosing bugs in for-loop decorators.\n\nThe fix addresses the correct problem and fits coherently within existing code conventions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n7. **Score:**\n\n<score>9</score>"

This is where the `partial` bound method object is created and wrapped with decorators. Here wrapping `bound_method` via `update_wrapper` with the original `method` ensures that attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. are preserved and avoids the `AttributeError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch seems to be crafted well and works harmoniously within the setup shown in the code span visits. The addition of `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` is logical and maintains entity-flow stability in the existing method decorator modules. It does not conflict with the helper modalities climaxed in existing functions like `_update_method_wrapper`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the described issue by ensuring that the `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` is called, correctly attributing the `bound_method` with the necessary properties from `method`. Since the `wrapper` needs to preserve these required function attributes, the patch appears effective and valid. It doesn't present any repetitive logic, incorrect API usage or overlook any edge cases from the present context.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This is relevant for ensuring the function passed retains necessary information.\n\nThe `method_decorator` span contains the logic to convert function decorators into method decorators, dealing with either a single or set of decorators. This makes sure the decorated method possesses the right attributes and signatures for bound methods.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<modified_hunks>\n- a/django/utils/decorators.py:33-49 -> b/django/utils/decorators.py:33-49\n</modified_hunks>\n\nIn the modified code, the `_wrapper` function utilized within `_multi_decorate` has now included a call to `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` immediately after binding the method. This call aims to assign the attributes of `method` to the `bound_method`, negating the original problem of attributes like `__name__` missing from the partially applied method.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct location because the changes are in the `_multi_decorate` function which is responsible for method decorations involving partial objects, ensuring they retain proper attributes.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe current implementation doesn't seem to introduce new issues. Instead, it aims to fix the missing proper attributes by using `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` in the already existing pattern codebase. Verifying through `_multi_decorate` and surrounded function scopes here should pose integrative coherence.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nReviewing the candidate patch against common mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: The patch does not introduce any repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The correct API and function `update_wrapper` is used appropriately.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The primary edge case mentioned in the issue is covered by preserving the method\u2019s key attributes in a bound state.\n\nThe patch leverages context correctly to preserve the method's attributes and thereby prevents the `AttributeError`. Thus, it effectively fixes the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
