The specific segment related to the issue includes conditions on when the \"show_save_as_new\" button should be displayed.

Originally, it checked only for `not is_popup`, `has_change_permission`, `change`, and `save_as`. The patch adds the condition `and has_add_permission` to this logic.

This is the correct location because this function constructs the button visibility logic for the admin interface and directly controls whether \"show_save_as_new\" should appear.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to contradict any other part of the identified code span. It correctly integrates an additional permission check (`has_add_permission`) alongside existing conditions without creating repetitive or conflicting logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the essential modification needed in the permissions check for the \"show_save_as_new\" button. It correctly adds the `has_add_permission` parameter, preventing users who lack add permissions from using this functionality. The patch does not introduce any new issues and aligns with the described request. Considering familiar common mistakes:\n1. No repetitive code was introduced.\n2. The correct properties (`has_add_permission`) are applied as required.\n3. The edge case (users lacking add permission but with change permission) is adequately handled.\n\nTherefore, this patch should effectively fix the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the issue**\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is related to a missing permission check in the Django admin's \"show_save_as_new\" button rendering logic. Specifically, in the file `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`, the condition for displaying the \"save as new\" button needs an additional verification step to check if the user has `has_add_permission`. The omission of this check allows users to see the \"save as new\" option and potentially perform actions without the necessary add permissions. The function responsible for rendering these buttons needs to incorporate this check to ensure the correct permissions are validated.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n**List of span ids:**\n- submit_row\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **submit_row**:\n    - This code span is the definition and implementation of the `submit_row` function, responsible for displaying the row of buttons for delete and save in the Django admin interface. \n    - The code specifically sets the context variables related to permissions and the state of the different save actions, including `show_save_as_new`.\n    - This directly relates to the issue described because the modification suggested would impact how the `show_save_as_new` value is determined and conditional upon.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n- `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`: lines 94-113.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1:**\n    - **Modified lines:** 94-113\n    - The code snippet in question adjusts the condition for \"show_save_as_new\" to also include `and has_add_permission`. Before the patch: the condition was `not is_popup and has_change_permission and change and save_as`. After the patch: this condition was amended to `not is_popup and has_add_permission and has_change_permission and change and save_as`. This modification incorporates the additional permission verification of `has_add_permission`, ensuring that \"save as new\" is only shown if the user has add permissions alongside the other required conditions.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The function `submit_row` is the logical place for this modification since it sets up the context for displaying the admin buttons, including \"show_save_as_new\". The fix directly modifies the logic within this function.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It simply adds an additional permission check (`has_add_permission`) to the existing logic that determines whether the \"save as new\" button should be shown. This change is consistent with the surrounding code and permissions model for the admin buttons.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nUntil the checks run most common LLM-generated mistakes:\n\n- **Repetitive code:** The LLM did not repeat any logic more than necessary. The modification is a straightforward addition within the if-condition of an existing context dictionary without duplication.\n- **Incorrect API usage:** The solution uses existing context properties (`has_add_permission` and other) correctly to achieve the needed behavior. I haven't identified any incorrect API usage.\n- **Overlooking edge cases:** The edge cases pertaining to permissions, such as lacking add permissions, have been satisfactorily handled by this patch via explicit conditional inclusion. All logical flows based upon varying permissions now include an evaluation for the add permission where appropriate.\n\nThe patch has effectively added the requisite permission check (`has_add_permission`) to the \"show_save_as_new\" condition. This is in line with the issue description. Consequently, it looks promising that the patch fixes the issue without causing further complications.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
