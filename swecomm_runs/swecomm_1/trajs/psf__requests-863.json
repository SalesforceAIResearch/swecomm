If a list is given, the code wraps the list within another list which then fails because a list is not callable.

In the initializer (`__init__`) method of the `Request` class:\n   - Adds checks to see if the hook from `hooks.items()` is a list.\n   - If it's a list, it iterates over it, and registers each hook using `register_hook`.\n   - If it's not a list, it registers it directly.\n\n2.

The new `TypeError` added for non-callable hooks further bolsters correctness by preventing invalid hook types.\n\nNone of the common LLM mistakes like repetitive code, incorrect API usage, or overlooking edge cases seem present in this context considering what's been provided.

Incorrect API usage:\n   - No obvious mistakes with API usage. The patch correctly modifies `register_hook`.\n\n3. Overlooking edge cases:\n   - Overlooking nested lists or handling inputs generated in upper feedback loops is still proper. However, a solid implementation accepts lists uniformly.\n\nOverall, the patch addresses the issue to allow dictionaries that have lists as values for hooks but could be optimized to eliminate code redundancy.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the issue**\n   \n   <issue_exp>\n   The issue involves the `Request` class's `register_hook()` method, which currently only accepts a single hook function per hook event when initialized. If you pass a list of hook functions, they are wrapped again in a list causing them to fail when consumed since a list is not callable. The request is to modify the initialization process to accept lists of hook functions for each hook to simplify how hooks can be used.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n   <span_ids>\n   [Request.register_hook, Request]\n   </span_ids>\n\n   <code_span_exp>\n   - **Request.register_hook (lines 463-466):** This is the method responsible for adding hooks to the `Request` object. Currently, it appends hooks directly to the relevant list in `self.hooks` for the specified event.\n   - **Request (lines 43-46):** Identifies the `Request` class definition, which is essential since it will house any changes to how hooks are handled during initialization.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   1. **Modified call at line 146:**\n   \n

The hooks initialization part in this method is directly related to the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- `requests/models.py` around line 146\n- `requests/models.py` around line 465\n\n<patch_exp>\n- In the first modified hunk (`requests/models.py` around line 146), the patch updates the `__init__` method to properly handle the `hooks` argument. It first initializes a default for hooks, then checks for hooks given as input. If a hook is a list, it iterates over the list and registers each hook individually.\n- In the second modified hunk (`requests/models.py` around line 465), the `register_hook` method is updated to extend a list of hooks if the provided hook argument is a list. Otherwise, it appends a single hook to the list.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The issue pertains to the initialization and registration of hooks in the `Request` class, specifically in the `__init__` method and the `register_hook` method.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch inadvertently introduces repetitive hooks initialization in the `__init__` method as `self.hooks[event] = []` is duplicated. This may lead to redundancy and potential logical errors.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by properly handling cases where hooks are provided as lists. However, the duplication in initializing hooks needs to be addressed. Common mistakes observed:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** The `self.hooks[event] = []` is set twice, once initially and once within the loop. This is redundant and could be simplified.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** There doesn't seem to be an incorrect API usage.\n3. **Edge Cases:** The patch appears to consider cases where hooks are lists, handling both individual and multiple hooks appropriately.\n\nFixing the repetitive hooks initialization would make this a strong patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
