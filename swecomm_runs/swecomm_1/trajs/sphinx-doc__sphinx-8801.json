Modifying or extending this function logic is likely necessary for addressing the issue of undocumented annotated members.\n2. **get_object_members**: This function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/importer.py` retrieves members and attributes of an object. Changes to correctly identify annotation-only members defined in superclasses are probably needed here, as this is where the introspection of class members occurs.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<hunks>\nOriginal Code: \n`elif isinstance(obj, ObjectMember) and obj.class_ is cls:`\nModified Code: \n`elif (isinstance(obj, ObjectMember) and obj.object is UNINITIALIZED_ATTR):`\nExplanation: The modification adds additional checks (object is `UNINITIALIZED_ATTR`) while retrieving and checking the members, implying an attempt to handle annotation-only members or uninitialized attributes properly.\n</hunks>\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function and logic paths in the `get_object_members` function in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`. Since `get_object_members` is responsible for gathering the members to be documented, the added checks for `UNINITIALIZED_ATTR` are needed to fix the issue of missing documentation for annotation-only members in superclasses.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nPotential new issue: Duplicate additions of the condition checking `isinstance(obj, ObjectMember) and obj.object is UNINITIALIZED_ATTR`. One occurrence is likely enough.

Some mistakes exist:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: Adding similar checks twice.\n2. **Edge Cases**: It isn't addressing other potential more strictly filtered documentation cases.\nGiven that the proposal captures the idea but does introduce redundancy, the fix is partial and needs improvement.\n\nFinal Judgement: There\u2019s a logical path enhancing, but introducing repetitive and redundant code has led to drop patch effectiveness.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
