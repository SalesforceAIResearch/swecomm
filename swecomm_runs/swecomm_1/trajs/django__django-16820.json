Changes in `django/db/migrations/autodetector.py` from line 1767.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The original code remains unmodified up till line 1774.\n\n- **`Hunk 1: Added Method to Convert index_together`**: \n    ```\n    def _convert_index_together_to_indexes(self, operation):\n        \"\"\"\n        Convert an AlterIndexTogether operation to a list of AddIndex operations.\n        \"\"\"\n        model_state = self.to_state.models[operation.app_label, operation.name]\n        indexes = []\n        for fields in operation.index_together:\n            index = models.Index(fields=fields)\n            indexes.append(operations.AddIndex(model_name=operation.name, index=index))\n        return indexes\n    ```\n    This added function clearly transforms an `AlterIndexTogether` operation to a list of `AddIndex` operations complying with the transition from `index_together` to `indexes` which adheres to handling the deprecation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Function Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch, which introduces the `_convert_index_together_to_indexes` method in the autodetector file, appears appropriately located. This aligns with the role of this file in converting and scrutinizing migration operations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch potentially adds complexity without verification on the automated handling of `index_together`, implying new-edge scenarios where transformations backfire if indexes/goals diverge dynamically across other migration contexts. However, no direct contradiction with the given code spans is observed.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nRegarding common LLM mistakes:\n\n1. **Repetitive code**: One method, `convert`, isn't repetitive since it's freshly introduced explicitly addressing one requirement conversion.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: Usage of standard Django operations, `models.Index` and `operations.AddIndex`, proves correct API engagement.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Edge cases linger unexplored; broader testing missing diverging field scenarios.\nFurther scrutiny, integrating into core algebra logic in referenced code spans and rigorous testing remains essential for stability.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The patch contains multiple modified hunks:\n\n   Modified hunk 1:\n   ``` \n   20: # Normalize together option values.\n21:     options = options or {}\n22:     together = {}\n23:     for option_name in (\"unique_together\", \"index_together\"):\n24:         value = options.pop(option_name, None)\n25:         if value:\n26:             together[option_name] = set(normalize_together(value))\n   ```\n   Duplicated from line 11 multiple times and some segments inside existing class methods.\n\n   This leads to seemingly logical normalization of `unique_together` and `index_together`. However, the hunk results in repetitive definitions and normalizations throughout, showing signs of redundancy.\n\n2. Adds a new `AlterIndexTogether` class:\n   ```\n   822:     option_name = \"index_together\"\n834:     def __init__(self, name, order_with_respect_to):\n835:         self.order_with_respect_to = order_with_respect_to\n836:         super().__init__(name)\n   ```\n   This new class seems correctly placed to follow the pattern in class `AlterTogetherOptionOperation`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch applies altering to the legitimate sections where deprecation needed primarily on CreateModel.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces obvious repeated code causing the creation of duplicate definitions. LLMs typically cause:\n- Redundancy in defining normalization logic inside `ModelOperation`, indicating poor sanitation checks.\nThese repetitions ride high chance on logical submission and would affect its validity.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nOverall, while the appropriate spots assigned entangles redundancy barrages highly affecting this patch request's grand cleanup intends for Magento2 migration pieces:\n1.

They intend to address the alteration requirements from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Check\n#### Explanation\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies `ModelOperation` and introduces new handling in the `CreateModel` class. These are relevant locations since the definition and handling of various model options like `index_together` and `indexes` happen here. However, multiple redundant and misformatted iterations of the logic are introduced, indicating the target location is correct, but the patching quality is questionable.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if New Issues are Introduced\n#### Explanation\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces heavy redundancy and unclean code leading to potential new issues. Multiple copies of normalization blocks are scattered across various parts without apparent structure, violating DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles and potentially causing unpredictable behavior.\n\nAdditionally, the logic added is not clearly organized. There appears to be mishaps in the `index-together` normalization.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Fix Issue Check\n#### Explanation\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempt is incorrect on multiple fronts:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: Adds the normalization process for `index_together` and `indexes` multiple times in a disorganized manner.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: Misuses structural duplication; overwrites method properties, making correct logical processing unintelligible.\n3. **Edge Cases Overlooked**: Overlooks how migrations might interplay when pervasive normalization mishaps occur during runtime.\n\nThus, the patch doesn't fix the issue; instead, it introduces clutter and confusion.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>\n-1\n</score>\n\nScore rationale: Due to poor repetitive code and the likelihood of introducing expansive new problems with how unstructured the patch is."

The suggested solution is to transition from `Meta.index_together` to `Meta.indexes`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n\nIdentified Code Span IDs:\n- Command.handle\n- MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_index_together\n- MigrationAutodetector.generate_removed_altered_index_together\n- MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner\n- MigrationOptimizer.optimize\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Command.handle`: This function handles migration squashing and is crucial as it processes migrations, including options related to index handling which is where the deprecation notice originates from.\n- `MigrationAutodetector.generate_altered_index_together`: This method in the autodetector generates operations for changes involving `index_together`, which is the deprecated feature we're targeting.\n- `MigrationAutodetector.generate_removed_altered_index_together`: Similar to the previous span, this handles operations related to the removal of `index_together`.\n- `MigrationOptimizer.optimize_inner`: Part of the migration optimization process which works on reducing and optimizing changelogs during migrations\u2014important for ensuring no deprecated methods remain.\n- `MigrationOptimizer.optimize`: This is the main entry point for optimizing migration operations and is relevant for ensuring deprecated codes are optimized away.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\nModified Hunks:\n- From `django/db/migrations/operations/models.py`, several areas show changes around normalizing together option values and normalizing indexes.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The initialization methods (such as `CreateModel.__init__` and `ModelOperation.__init__`) now include changes which normalize the \"together\" option values. The patch checks and properly sets values like `unique_together` and `index_together`\n2. Operations now require that indexes had their names set explicitly, thus aiming to migrate fully from `index_together` to `Meta.indexes`.\n3. The patch is replacing \"index_together\" uses throughout model migration operations with processes aimed at normalizing the indexes attribute and asserting correct configuration. Multiple redundant code blocks also appears due to patches possibly added or repeated accidentally.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Is the Patch Fixing the Correct Function?**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct functions and applies changes to the essential migration elements like `CreateModel`, ensuring the deprecation of `index_together` and adequate normalization of indexes.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introduction of New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the patch introduces new issues:\n1. The patch introduces substantial repetitive code\u2014multiple identical chunks meant to normalize options and index validations are redundantly added.\n2. Repetitive \"normalize together\" operations add complexity and could lead to maintenance issues due to numerous entries without context or consolidation.\n3. Modifications such as inserting huge chunks without coherence might disrupt existing functionalities.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Does The Patch Fix the Issue?**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nPartially. It does address the transition from `index_together` to proper `indexes` in Django models. However, it falls into the common LLM mistake categories:\n1. Introduces repetitive code.\n2. While addressing the deprecation, the new repetitions of normalization code can lead to a bloated codebase with possibilities for new errors or unforeseen breaking changes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>3</score>"
