This function is central to addressing the problem as a new user-friendly API should leverage it.\n2. `Module._importtestmodule`: This span is responsible for the import process of test modules.

By updating `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` to introduce `skip_module`, it ensures users can skip test modules easily.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modifications themselves do not seem to contradict the identified code spans or introduce new issues. However, there is a slight repetition where `skip_module` needs a parameter context comment at the `config.addinivalue_line` span of `skipping.py`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately follows the request, providing a new `skip_module` convenience method that will skip tests module-wise and harmonize with the existing `skip` function's logic correctly. Compared to the common pitfalls:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** The code uses existing logic\u2014all modified in homogeneous style.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** Maintains connecting functional capabilities using `pytest` conventions.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases:** Adequately disarmed issues stated in the problem without mismatching use-case contradictions.\n\nStill, it would help users to adapt within docs updates to integrate naturally through adjustments globally.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nFinal score:\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "### Step-by-Step Analysis for Review\n\n#### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\nThe issue in question is about improving the handling of skipping a module-level test in `pytest`. Users face problems when trying to skip entire test modules based on Python version constraints (or other conditions) using APIs that don't work as expected or give unclear error messages. Specifically, this involves:\n\n1. Skipping module-level tests if the Python version is older than 3.8.\n2. Avoiding errors when a module uses Python 3.8 syntax but runs under an older Python version.\n3. Enhancing error messages or supporting new APIs to clarify correct usage.\n\nOutput Explanation:\n<issue_exp>There is a need to improve handling of module-level skip tests in `pytest`, especially for scenarios involving different Python versions. The user encounters an error when trying to skip such modules, and the current documentation or error messages encourage usage patterns that are not conducive for the `skip` function with `allow_module_level=True`. Proposals include better documentation or a new convenient API for this purpose.</issue_exp>\n\n#### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span ids: `skip`, `Module._importtestmodule`, `evaluate_skip_marks`\n\nOutput List:\n```\n- skip\n- Module._importtestmodule\n- evaluate_skip_marks\n```\n\nExplain Relevance:\n1. **skip (src/_pytest/outcomes.py)**: This function is directly relevant because it supports skipping at multiple levels. It already takes an `allow_module_level` parameter crucial to handling module-level skips.\n2. **Module._importtestmodule (src/_pytest/python.py)**: This function involves the process of importing test modules and handles certain errors, including attempts to skip modules incorrectly, making it central to executing module-level skips.\n3. **evaluate_skip_marks (src/_pytest/skipping.py)**: This function evaluates markers on test items related to skipping (`skip` and `skipif`). Its role in understanding and applying these markers is essential for correctly implementing module-level skips.\n\nOutput Explanation:\n<code_span_exp>1. `skip` function: Crucial for implementing the ability to skip tests at different levels.\n2. `Module._importtestmodule`: Handles code that checks proper tests, including skipping entire modules.\n3. `evaluate_skip_marks`: Evaluates conditions that dictate when tests should be skipped, including module-level skips.</code_span_exp>\n\n#### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n```\n- File: src/_pytest/outcomes.py, Lines Modified: 120-169\n- File: src/_pytest/skipping.py, Lines Modified: 52-73\n```\n\nHunk explanations:\n- **src/_pytest/outcomes.py (Lines 120-169)**: Introduces the `skip_module` function, helping users skip an entire module easily by internally calling `skip` with `allow_module_level=True`.\n- **src/_pytest/skipping.py (Lines 52-73)**: Adds functionality and documentation for `skip_module` so it can be used as a pytest API, aligning the skipping behavior with the updated `outcomes`.\n\nOutput Explanation:\n<patch_exp>1. Introduced `skip_module` method in `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` that simplifies module-level skipping by internally calling `skip` with `allow_module_level=True`.\n2. Added function and documentation in `src/_pytest/skipping.py` to extend pytest API for `skip_module`.</patch_exp>\n\n#### Step 4: Correct Function Check\n\nThe change correctly targets the functions that handle skipping at all levels, especially modifying the `skip` function and incorporating a new `skip_module` function. Thus, yes, the patch is modifying the correct functions.\n\nOutput Explanation:\n<correct_location_exp>The patch correctly addresses the needed functionality within correct functions and locations. It modifies `skip` and adds a `skip_module` method, pertinent to skipping tests at the module level.</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### Step 5: Introduce New Issues Check\n\nThe introduced `skip_module` function is consistent with the identified code spans and usage of the `skip` function, enhancing utility without affecting existing logic.\n\nOutput Explanation:\n<new_issues_exp>The introduced patch does not contradict any identified code spans and does not seem to introduce new issues. If anything, it extends the functionality clearly aligned with existing mechanisms.</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### Step 6: Issue Fix Check\n\n- **Repetitive Code**: The patch does not introduce repetitive logic.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: The patch adheres to the use of `skip` definition patterns from Pytest.\n- **Edge Cases**: The patch seems to cover the addressed use cases, adding functionality to overcome version-related test skipping issues.\n\nGenerally, the patch fits within the norms and seems effectively targeted to overcome the outlined issues in its requirements.\n\nOutput Explanation:\n<fix_issue_exp>This patch addresses the outlined problem, especially offering a pathway for module-level test skipping. It avoids common LLM mistakes effectively and presents a coherent and functional enhancement without unhandled parts.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n#### Step 7: Score\n\nDue to good alignment and coherence of the patch with requirements and no apparent issues, I would rate it:\n\n<score>10</score>"

Hence, the `skip_module` adopts criteria for differences plugged behind/ maintaining native error/resolves documented guidance stipulations as cohered per the spread targeted span contexts.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score**\n\n<score>9</score>"

Both the addition of the new `skip_module` function and changes to documentation do not interfere with the logic in the existing considered spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check If the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch creates the proposed API change to make module-level skipping easier, addressing the original problem effectively. Here's the analysis against common LLM mistakes:\n\n1. Repetitive code: There is no significant logic duplication. It introduces only a small function `skip_module` which reuses the existing `skip` function.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The introduction of `skip_module` is within domain logic and correctly interacts with arguments, introducing a new, clear API.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Edge cases considering `allow_module_level` functionality seem covered by the checks and re-raises in:_importtestmodule. \nIt seamlessly integrates new functionality handling module-level skipping directly fulfilling the proposed API requirement and improvement. Thus, both sub-issues are well-activated: clarify skip function doc, providing alternate API `skip_module`.\n\nAs these changes are logical, concise enhancements without evidence of detrimental side-effects, solely address the issues on-point.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>10</score>"

It is relevant because it works alongside key functionality associated with skipping tests.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk 1: Changes to the `__init__` method of the `Skipped` class to better accommodate `allow_module_level` attribute. \n- Hunk 2: Modifications to the `skip` function definition and its integration decorator.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**:\n   - The patch updates the `__init__` method of the `Skipped` class to correctly handle and prioritize the `allow_module_level` parameter without introducing new redundant logic and attributes.\n2. **Hunk 2**:\n   - The patch simplifies and extends the `skip` function definition to improve its documentation and compliance. The function is wrapped with an exception decorator `_with_exception(Skipped)`, ensuring proper error flows through pytest.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch edits the `skip` function and the `Skipped` exception class's initialization. These modifications are indeed where handling of the `skip` logic and module-level settings are defined, thereby making changes in the correct location of the code.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict or create new issues when considering the identified code spans. The amendments enhance the definitory scope and handling capabilities of existing attributes seamlessly, without creating redundancy or conflicting behaviors.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### Step 6: Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\n1. **Repetitive code**: There's some repetition regarding how attributes are presented and called (`*: , `allow_module_level= bool=False`), albeit not inherently harmful, could be more concise.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The `skip` function, although stylistically altered, maintains its correctness as per how pytest should handle test-skipping per the reported try-except blocks and handling behaviors.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: No apparent overlook here as the amended documentation clarifies module-level allowance; however, more exhaustive test cases might be vigilant.\n\nThus, the patch should substantially fix the targeted support, but improved refactoring unity can be considered.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n<score>7</score>"

Existing mechanisms via `pytest` for skipping modules generate an error message discouraging the use of the skip function outside tests while suggesting decorators like `@pytest.mark.skip` or `@pytest.mark.skipif` don't work before importing a module that has incompatible syntax.

It introduces new parameter parsing, though unclearly.\n</Explanation>\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch targets the `skip` and `Skipped.__init__` functions, which are pertinent locations per the issue text; skipping tests properly with `allow_module_level` is central to these implementations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the new patch is introducing issues such as:\n1. Repeated multiple separators `*, *`, causing a syntax error.\n2. Duplicated and redundant decorator and function definitions causing confusion and potential run-time errors.\n3. The changes contradict the original code spans leading to later code misinterpreting `skip` behavior warnings and documentation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not meet expected aspirations for fixing the issue:\n1. The separation or `repetition` of commas involves introducing syntax errors influencing function definitions.\n2. There is unreliable decorator and functional duplication adding confusion and no clear solution for the alternate API like introducing \"skip_module(reason)\" appropriately.\n3. It doesn't enhance the error messaging as outlined in the necessary aspects or ensures Python version compliances successfully authorize smoothly without interruptions while mismanaging present conventions already in place.\nTherefore, this very effectively brings forward even post-patching inconsistencies, errors, and unsolved argumentations, essentially unsuited as per the rather clean problem precision and required reform needed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
