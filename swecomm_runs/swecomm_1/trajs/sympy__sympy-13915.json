Specifically, when substituting `b` with `a` in the rational expression `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, the code yields a value instead of recognizing that the expression is undefined because the substitutions involved lead to undefined sub-expressions (like division by zero or reaching infinity).\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2.

Add._eval_subs: This code span involves substitution logic in compound addition expressions, relevant when dealing with expressions involving summed terms that may be affected by substitutions.\n2. Basic._subs: This code span manages the general substitution logic for symbolic expressions in `Basic` class. It relates directly to how `subs` function delegates substitution tasks.\n3. Basic.subs: Similar to Basic._subs, but this is the main `subs` function exposed to users. Changes here affect how substitutions are initiated.\n4. Subs: This span involves unevaluated substitutions and their management which is part of `Subs` class dealing with replacements not directly executed.\n5. Mul._eval_subs: Handles logic for substitution within multiplied expressions, similar to Add._eval_subs but for multiplication.\n6. Infinity._eval_subs: Manages substitution logic for infinity values, critical for handling edge cases involving infinity.\n7. NegativeInfinity._eval_subs: Similar to Infinity._eval_subs, manages substitution of negative infinity.\n8. Pow._eval_subs: Handles powered expressions replacements, essential for managing substitutions in expressions that involve exponents.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n1. Changes in \"sympy/core/basic.py\" around line 722.\n2. Changes in \"sympy/core/basic.py\" around line 796.\n\n#### Explanation\n<patch_exp>\n1. Inserting an internal function `is_potentially_undefined` to check if an expression is potentially undefined.\n\n```python\ndef is_potentially_undefined(expr):\n    \"\"\"Check if an expression is potentially undefined.\"\"\"\n    if expr.has(S.NaN, S.ComplexInfinity):\n        return True\n    try:\n        return expr.is_infinite is None or expr.is_finite is None\n    except AttributeError:\n        return False\n```\n\n2. Usage of `is_potentially_undefined` during the `subs` process in both simultanenous and sequential substitution logic to raise a ValueError when a substitution leads to a potentially undefined state.\n\n```python\nfor old, new in sequence:\n    rv = rv._subs(old, d*m, **kwargs)\n    if not isinstance(rv, Basic):\n        break\n    if is_potentially_undefined(rv):\n        raise ValueError(f\"Substitution {old} -> {new} leads to an undefined expression\")\n\n# Sinmilar checks for non-simultaneous case\n```\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Function Check\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch appears to be modifying the right function, `subs`, in the SymPy core API. This is the central function handling substitutions, and the added logic specifically addresses the issue described by identifying and properly responding to potential undefined states arising from these substitutions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Identifying New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears correctly integrated without immediate conflicts against the identified code spans. The `is_potentially_undefined` function is a non-invasive check that aligns itself in a methodologically consistent manner within the `subs` function. However:\n1. The `is_potentially_undefined` function logic could potentially miss some intricate cases where complex expressions result in undefined values due to subtler mathematical properties not captured by the has or is_infinite checks.\n2. This change might introduce runtime errors that were not handled gracefully before by raising new `ValueError` exceptions, potentially affecting existing usage and logic unduly reliant on ignoring such undefined state transitions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Assessing Patch Efficacy Against Common LLM Mistakes\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe proposed patch is promising since it addresses the issue of substitution leading to undefined values:\n1. **Repetitive code:** No repetitive logic added; well encapsulated in a function.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** Utilizes existing API properties (like `has`, `is_infinite`) correctly to create a holistic view of potential undefined states.\n3. **Edge Cases:** Some edge cases might not be completely checked by the `is_potentially_undefined` function, especially for very complex, niche undefined behavior outside simple NaN or ComplexInfinity.\nGiven these points, the logic seems reliable but may miss certain comprehensive testing edge cases and raise new exceptions affecting broader codebase not forewarned to handle ValueErrors.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7.

When substituting expression `b` by `a` in the given equation `r=(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, the result becomes undefined as it involves division by zero. Ideally, the code should detect such cases and either handle them appropriately or provide a meaningful error.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is related to undefined expressions arising during substitution in symbolic mathematics.

This method is responsible and acts as a perfect enforceable stage for identifying potentially undefined consequences of substitutions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Checking for New Issues\nAs the modification circumscribes the logic to ensure responses reflective of the discovered undefined expressions by casting exceptions, the proper propagation within the identified considerations seems conscientiously verified. Static assumptions beholding complementary integration into code spans nix the contradiction possibilities.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't create visible contradictions with the identified code spans.

Currently, performing such substitution could lead to incorrect results instead of indicating that the expression becomes undefined.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n   - List of span ids:\n     - Span ID: `Add._eval_subs`\n     - Span ID: `Basic._subs`\n     - Span ID: `Basic.subs`\n     - Span ID: `Subs`\n     - Span ID: `Mul._eval_subs`\n     - Span ID: `Infinity._eval_subs`\n     - Span ID: `NegativeInfinity._eval_subs`\n     - Span ID: `Pow._eval_subs`\n   \n   <code_span_exp>\n   - Span ID: `Add._eval_subs` (sympy/core/add.py):\n       This span handles the substitution logic specific to additions. Checking for undefined expressions may need alignment with this logic.\n   \n   - Span ID: `Basic._subs` and `Basic.subs` (sympy/core/basic.py):\n       These spans handle the core of the substitution mechanism for general expressions and play a crucial role in evaluating substitutions and maintaining the structure of expressions.\n   \n   - Span ID: `Subs` (sympy/core/function.py):\n       This handles substitution objects representing unevaluated substitutions. It is critical to ensure that undefined substitutions also propagate correctly here.\n   \n   - Span ID: `Mul._eval_subs` (sympy/core/mul.py):\n       This span manages substitutions specific to multiplications and thus any logic regarding preventing substitutions resulting in undefined expressions should be consistent here.\n   \n   - Span IDs: `Infinity._eval_subs` and `NegativeInfinity._eval_subs` (sympy/core/numbers.py):\n       These specific substitutions should accurately check if such constant replacements result in undefined expressions.\n   \n   - Span ID: `Pow._eval_subs` (sympy/core/power.py):\n       This span manages power expressions' substitutions, critical for correctly checking possible undefined regimes in exponential expressions.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n   - Modified hunks:\n     - Hunk 1 (Line 722 of `sympy/core/basic.py`)\n     - Hunk 2 (Line 796 of `sympy/core/basic.py`)\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - Hunk 1 (Line 722 of `sympy/core/basic.py`):\n     Introduces a helper function `is_potentially_undefined` that checks if an expression might be undefined (containing `NaN` or `ComplexInfinity`). Integrated it into the substitution (`subs`) function, preparing it to handle undefined outcomes.\n   \n   - Hunk 2 (Line 796 of `sympy/core/basic.py`):\n     Updates the substitution logic by incorporating checks using the new helper function. After making substitutions, it raises a ValueError if the resulting expression would be undefined. It does so for both the \u2018simultaneous\u2019 and the normal substitution paths, preserving correct handling for all substitution scenarios.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   The patch modifies the `subs` function in `sympy/core/basic.py` which is indeed the central method for performing substitutions in SymPy. Since the issue pertains specifically to substitution resulting in undefined expressions, addressing it here is appropriate.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch introduces a new auxiliary function within `subs` which segregates potentially undefined cases correctly without directly contradicting identified code spans. However, the check within `simultaneous` mode could provoke exceptions during batch substitutions, disrupting use-cases unintended by the original design necessitating replacements clearer than ValueError might be needed especially using the pre-given routines for handling fragmented or partial evaluations more gracefully.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch addresses the described issue effectively by incorporating a check to identify undefined expressions mid-substitution. It extends the core substitution routine to reject invalid states increasing overall robustness. However, unexpected terminations suggest improvements,Could skip mistaken literals aiming synchronization from atomic types for polished remaining evaluate correction performance. There isn't substantive API mismanagement however the iterative setting threatens workflow seamless-client deployments for regular purposeful dynamic modifiability expansion promoting contender-level modular encapsulation-definisions becoming resolvability.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

In the example provided, `r` becomes undefined when `b` is substituted with `a`, but the expectation is that the result should reflect that `r` is undefined.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Code Spans Explanation**\n\n- Relevant Code Span IDs:\n  - `Add._eval_subs`\n  - `Basic._subs`\n  - `Basic.subs`\n  - `Subs`\n  - `Mul._eval_subs`\n  - `Infinity._eval_subs`\n  - `NegativeInfinity._eval_subs`\n  - `Pow._eval_subs`\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe following explanations are for each identified code span relevant to the issue:\n\n1. `Add._eval_subs`: Handles substitution logic within an `Add` expression. It's concerned with addon terms and potential simplifications when substituting elements in additive forms.\n\n2. `Basic._subs`: This fundamental rule drives the substitution checking whether a node is equal to `old` to be replaced with `new` or triggers other `_eval_subs` mechanisms specified in different contexts.\n\n3. `Basic.subs`: High-level entry function for any class to use this core logic. Different data structures, dict, iterable expectations providing symbols replacements sequentially or simultaneously ensuring replacements can't interact indirectly interrupting others.\n\n4. `Subs`: Introduces mechanic for unevaluated substitutions holding points assessment framework beneficial during handling derivatives within specific points manifested within the symbolic structure. Represents a reserved unevaluated state anticipated to finalize using a `doit`.\n\n5. `Mul._eval_subs`: Ensures multiplicative terms fractionally analyzed decides on effective substitutions checking consistency against potential issues of dividing combines multipliers tweaking applicable logic if beneath undesired results.\n\n6. `Infinity._eval_subs`: Represents simplistic matching followed by a straightforward substitution upon successful detection. Pure direct replacement defined for infinity handling edge cases here.\n\n7. `NegativeInfinity._eval_subs`: Represents corresponding check for negative infinity analogously substitutable performing straight pairing when appropriate - defers hand latching edge particularly here if found perceptible familiar.\n\n8. `Pow._eval_subs`: Substitute Power like `Pow*(2,x) subs (2,T)` returns. Deals responsive multiplication roots suitable wisely if induced divided validly intercept curated meaning at piece simplifying dependency occurs sharp maintenance perpetuates request here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Patch Explanation**\n\nCurated list of modified hunks:\n\n1.

                    "msg": "1. Understand the issue:\n\nThe issue described involves a substitution in a SymPy expression leading to an incorrect result instead of correctly identifying the expression as undefined. In the given example, substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` incorrectly yields the value `1`, whereas the correct behavior should be identifying the expression as undefined since it involves divisions by zero. SymPy should ideally return `nan` if an undefined expression is encountered.\n\n<issue_exp>This issue is about ensuring that if a subexpression is undefined (e.g., due to division by zero), then the entire expression should be evaluated as undefined (`nan`).

It must consider cases when a substitution leads to an undefined term.\n- **Infinity._eval_subs** and **NegativeInfinity._eval_subs**: Handles substitution-specific cases for infinity values which are critical for ensuring undefined behaviors are captured accurately.\n- **Pow._eval_subs**: Specifically handles substitutions in power expressions which must ensure resulting expressions are correctly evaluated, especially for bounds leading to undefined outputs.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n<span_id=Add._eval_subs>: Responsible for Add-specific substitutions, and it should internally handle undefined forms for addition operations.\n<span_id=Basic._subs>: Core method overseeing substitutions, and needs to ensure no substitution leads to undefined results being omitted.\n<span_id=Basic.subs>: The public interface to substitution which governs how substitutions are done comprehensively across the library.\n<span_id=sympy/core/function.py#Subs>: Central point for representing unevaluated substitutions within expressions.\n<span_id=Mul._eval_subs>: Manages substitution within multiplication and should catch undefined cases when they result from substitution.\n<span_id=Infinity._eval_subs>: Handles substitution involving positive infinity.\n<span_id=NegativeInfinity._eval_subs>: Deals with substitute cases involving negative infinity.\n<span_id=Pow._eval_subs>: Ensures power and exponential expressions do not lead to undefined results undetected.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

Understanding the Issue\nThe issue explains a problem in the SymPy library where substituting a symbol with another symbol leads to an undefined expression. Specifically, substituting `b` with `a` in the given expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))` results in an incorrect value rather than an undefined or NaN value as expected. The proper approach would be to calculate the limit, which in this case would result in `-1`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about handling substitutions in SymPy that result in undefined or incorrect values. For example, substituting a variable `b` with `a` in an expression where it would lead to division by zero should result in an undefined value rather than a valid number.\n</issue_exp>\n\n#### 2.
