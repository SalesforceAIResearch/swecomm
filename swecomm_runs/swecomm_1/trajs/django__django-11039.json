The issue originates from `sqlmigrate.py` within the `Command.handle` method where the `self.output_transaction` needs to also consider whether the database supports rolling back DDL.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch correctly updates the `self.output_transaction` to account for both conditions specified in the issue description. No new issues are contradictory to the identified code spans. It neither introduces repetitive code nor incorrect API usage.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by modifying the logic to only enable transactions if both conditions are met. However, the critique lies within additional coverage:\n1. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: If the `connection` or `connection.features` is None or improperly initialized, it might cause errors. Ensuring these variables are properly checked would enhance robustness.\n2. **Test Additions**: The issue explicitly recommends adding a test case for this condition in `test_commands.py`. The patch does not address this requirement.\n\nTo truly close the issue:\n- Adding relevant test case(s) would actually verify this change.\n- Handle possible edge cases ensuring robust verification of `connection` and its `features` attribute.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>7</score>"

Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of Modified Hunks**\n- Change in `sqlmigrate.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk in `sqlmigrate.py` lines 50-65**:\n   - **Before the Patch**:\n     ```python\n         # Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations\n         self.output_transaction = migration.atomic\n     ```\n   - **After the Patch**:\n     ```python\n         # Show begin/end around output only for atomic migrations and if the connection supports rollback DDL\n         self.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n     ```\n   - **Explanation**: This patch changes the logic for the output of transaction wrappers (`BEGIN/COMMIT`) in the `sqlmigrate` command.

By introducing the condition `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl`, it ensures that `BEGIN/COMMIT` statements are appended only when the database can roll back DDL changes. Evaluating it against common LLM mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: The logic is simple and concise, with no unnecessary repetitions.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Uses the relevant features flag from `BaseDatabaseFeatures` (`can_rollback_ddl`).\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: It handles the primary scenarios inducing the bug and covers both Boolean sides \u2013 atomic migrations and support for transactional DDL.\n\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue without introducing errors seen in typical LLM-generated patches.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score Evaluation\n\nBased on the articulated measure of the correction provided by this patch, rit appears to be pristinely targeting the aberration without faltering into common pitfalls.\n\n<score>10</score>"

The `sqlmigrate` command currently wraps its output in `BEGIN` and `COMMIT` statements if the migration is marked as `atomic`. However, this wrapping should occur only if both the migration is atomic **and** the database schema editor can perform rollback of the Data Definition Language (DDL). The goal is to update the logic in `sqlmigrate` to check for both these conditions.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the sqlmigrate command in Django wraps SQL output in transactions (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`) only based on the atomic attribute of a migration. The wrapped output should also consider whether the database supports transactional DDL by checking the feature `can_rollback_ddl`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n#### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span ids:\n1. Command\n2. Command.handle\n3. BaseDatabaseFeatures\n4. MigrationExecutor.collect_sql\n\nExplanation:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Command: This is the base class defining the command's behavior and attributes, among which `output_transaction` is set default to True.\n2. Command.handle: This method defines the main logic of handling the command execution, including resolving migration and producing SQL outputs where `self.output_transaction` is used.\n3. BaseDatabaseFeatures: Contains various feature flags for the database, including `can_rollback_ddl` which indicates if the database supports rollbacking DDL operations.\n4. MigrationExecutor.collect_sql: This method constructs a range of SQL statements based on a plan which will eventually be impacted by the migrated code wrapping SQL into transactions indicating if it respects the added database feature check.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in the file `django/core/management/commands/sqlmigrate.py`\n\nExplanation:\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch focuses on line modifications in the `Command.handle` method in `sqlmigrate.py`:\n- The change is made in setting the value of `self.output_transaction`. Instead of simply checking `migration.atomic`, the patch adds an extra condition `and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to the assignment.\n```python\nself.output_transaction = migration.atomic and connection.features.can_rollback_ddl\n```\nSo, the transaction output (`BEGIN`/`COMMIT`) will be wrapped only if the migration is atomic and the database supports DDL rollbacks.\n\nThere are no modifications to other lines of the function or introduction of new functionalities elsewhere.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### 4. Check Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the logic in `sqlmigrate.py`, updating the assignment of `self.output_transaction` to reflect both the `atomic` attribute of migrations and whether the database supports DDL rollback. This is determined by both attributes and thus considered as the correct location to handle this issue as it aligns with where `self.output_transaction` is set and controls the consideration around `BEGIN`/`COMMIT`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### 5. Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues because it adds a logical `AND` condition to an existing line of code. There are no conflicting statements or repetitions observed. Identified spans such as check on `can_rollback_ddl` from `features.py` reflect homogeneous portions controlled uninterruptedly addressing the tackled issue without creating cyclic/compound conflicts.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Check if the Patch fixes the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately uses the desired feature flag `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` to supplement the `atomic` check for determining `self.output_transaction`. It avoids common LLM introduced errors, such as:\n1. Repetitive code: Only added succinct condition without redundancies.\n2. Incorrect API usage: Proper access via `connection.features`.\n3. Edge cases: Addressed by ensuring both transactional support attributes are adequately checked. The solution uses required checks making `sqlmigrate` cease transaction spotting when bounded features turn insufficient solving the raised ticket effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n#### Final Score\n\nThe analysis reveals that the fix is correctly implemented without introducing contradictions or new issues. Hence a cut above par result:\n\n<score>10</score>"

This change ensures accurate conditional wrapping of migration SQL statements in transaction blocks in the `Command.handle` method.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modification itself does not introduce any new issues and aligns well with the intent described in the issue. There are no changes that contradict the identified spans' logic. Additionally, since `connection` is already used elsewhere in this method to set the executor, its usage here seems contextually accurate.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nLLM-generated Fix Common Issues:\n1. Repetitive code: There does not appear to be any repetitive code in the patch.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The `connection.features.can_rollback_ddl` check appears to be the right API based on information from `BaseDatabaseFeatures`.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: The added condition recognizes a critical edge case where the backend cannot roll back DDL. The patch resolves the issue listed without introducing problematic edge cases.\n\nBy validating the `self.output_transaction` condition to use additional checks, the code's logic improves and will now conform to the behavior described in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
