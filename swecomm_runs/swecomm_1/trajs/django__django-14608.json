However, there are small chances of an edge case where `self.error_class` might not handle the extra argument well.\n\nA bit of further inspection (perhaps a quick glance at the implementation/definition of `error_class`) may be prudent to ensure compatibility, but it generally looks robust.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is likely to successfully fix the issue.

The existing implementation adds a 'nonfield' CSS class for non-field errors in ErrorList instances for single forms.

This separation allows developers to distinguish between field-level errors, form-level errors, and formset-level errors in the rendered output.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n#### List of Span IDs\n\n1. `BaseForm.non_field_errors`\n2. `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors`\n3. `BaseFormSet.full_clean`\n4. `BaseFormSet`\n\n#### Explanation of Each Code Span\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `BaseForm.non_field_errors`: This function returns an ErrorList of errors that are not associated with a specific field in a form, using the specified error_class 'nonfield'.\n- `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors`: This function, which is directly impacted by the current issue, returns an ErrorList of errors that aren't associated with any particular form within a FormSet.\n- `BaseFormSet.full_clean`: This method updates `self._non_form_errors` to an error class instance and populates errors during the validation process which includes setting self._non_form_errors with validation errors.\n- `BaseFormSet`: The parent class for managing a collection of forms, including error handling logic, and default error messages.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n\n1. `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors` method in `django/forms/formsets.py`.\n\n#### Explanation of Each Modified Hunk\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

However, there are a couple of concerns to note:\n1. Repetitive Code: While the patch itself doesn't introduce new code that is repetitive, the added logic might benefit from some reusability across other similar error classification mechanisms in the form.\n2. Incorrect API usage, edge cases: The patch seems correct in terms of usage according to the relevant class (error_class). It correctly considers the case where `_non_form_errors` may be `None` and calls `full_clean` to ensure errors are captured, covering edge cases effectively.\n\nOverall, the function\u2019s change robustly aligns with the requested functionality without altering broader logics or structures.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It's the primary method that the patch modifies to implement the new `nonform` CSS class.\n  \n- `BaseFormSet.full_clean`: This method performs the overall cleaning for the `FormSet` and populates the `_non_form_errors`. An understanding of this method is essential to ensure that non-form errors are appropriately set and can be used to validate the changed code.\n  \n- `BaseFormSet`: Represents the class structure to which the new functionality will be added and context around error management within a `FormSet`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in `django/forms/formsets.py` in the `non_form_errors` method.\n\nExplanation of hunks:\n1. The patch modifies the `non_form_errors` method of the `BaseFormSet` class. It changes the return statement from returning `self._non_form_errors` directly, to wrapping it in `self.error_class` with the new `nonform` class included:\n```python\nreturn self.error_class(self._non_form_errors, 'nonform')\n```\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, this patch modifies the right location. The `non_form_errors` method of the `BaseFormSet` is exactly where the return value of non-form errors needs to be adjusted with the new `nonform` CSS class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch seems not to introduce any new issues. It's merely wrapping the existing `_non_form_errors` in an `ErrorList` with the `nonform` CSS class, and it doesn't contradict any identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does address the requested change by adding a `nonform` CSS class to non-form error returns. However, let's evaluate based on common mistakes:\n\n1. **Repetitive code:** No signs of repetitive logic here.\n  \n2. **Incorrect API usage:** Uses the `error_class` which appears to align with the behavior of similar methods like `BaseForm.non_field_errors`. This usage looks correct.\n  \n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** The current patch only adds a CSS class. However, it could overlook how `self._non_form_errors` is set within `full_clean`\u2014specifically based on `full_clean`'s final lines. It initialize `self._non_form_errors` as `self.error_class()` already, and in the event of validation errors in `full_clean`, it resets `self._non_form_errors`. Though these seem unrelated to CSS, if any inconsistencies occur, a rendering error might carry forward unexpectedly.\n\nSumming up, the common pitfalls are largely avoided. It's just useful to reassess around `full_clean`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The purpose is to allow custom ErrorLists to distinguish between form field errors, non-field errors, and non-form errors when rendering error messages.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n```python\n[\n\"djan span_id=BaseForm.non_field_errors\",\n\" span_id=BaseFormSet.non_form_errors\",\n\" span_id=BaseFormSet.full_clean\",\n\" span_id=BaseFormSet\"\n]\n```\n<code_span_exp>\n- **span_id=BaseForm.non_field_errors**: This code span depicts the method definition for `non_field_errors` and shows how non-field errors get an `error_class` of `nonfield`, acting as a reference.\n- **span_id=BaseFormSet.non_form_errors**: This method returns an `ErrorList` of errors not associated with a particular form, making it relevant to creating a similar mechanism for non-form errors.\n- **span_id=BaseFormSet.full_clean**: This code span includes the logic for cleaning and populating form errors and non-form errors and contains the main logic where we have modifications.\n- **span_id=BaseFormSet**: This code shows the general structure of the `BaseFormSet` class, within which the changes are made to accommodate the new error class.\n</code_span>ever_text\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 0**: The change was made within the `full_clean` method of FormSets.

The changes are made inside the `full_clean` method, which deals with non-form errors. Hence, it will have the desired effect of assigning a CSS class for non-form errors appropriately.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces an issue by initializing the `_non_form_errors` inside `full_clean` with the CSS class `'nonform'`. While catching the ValidationError previously resulted in overwriting `_non_form_errors`, now it is extending it. Unlike the documentation or logic copying from `non_field_errors`, it fails to keep consistent CSS class names.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is in perpetuity mistaken on multiple fronts. Custom `nonform` Errors fail to override previously continuing, risking establishment eventually overriding or accumulating ambiguations. Furthermore, not catering extensions as arbitrary values is presumably Incorrect API Usage jackpot.\nRepetitiveness is clear from passing inductor `non\u0259lifields` thoroughly likelihood

When displaying errors, form errors get a `nonfield` class for non-field errors, but formsets lack this specific distinction for non-form errors. The task involves adding this nonform class, similar to forms, enabling easier identification and rendering of these errors.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nList of Span IDs:\n- `BaseForm.non_field_errors`\n- `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors`\n- `BaseFormSet.full_clean`\n- `BaseFormSet`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `BaseForm.non_field_errors`: Relevant as it includes how non-field errors for forms get an `error_class` with `nonfield`. This sets a precedent for what is expected in formsets.\n- `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors`: Describes how non-form errors in formsets are returned and their descriptions. Key for ensuring formsets correctly implement the `nonform` class.\n- `BaseFormSet.full_clean`: Processes and populates non-form errors. The existing method doesn't currently set a CSS class identifying non-form errors.\n- `BaseFormSet`: Provides context on what `BaseFormSet` modifies within the form structures and their use of error handling.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\nList of Modified Hunks:\n- BaseFormSet.full_clean modification to include `nonform` error class.\n- Update in the `try-except` block within `BaseFormSet.full_clean` to use `extend` on `_non_form_errors`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **First Hunk:** Modifies the `full_clean` function to initialize `_non_form_errors` with an error class that includes `nonform`.\n- **Second Hunk:** Enhances the error assignment in `BaseFormSet` by replacing direct assignment with extending the existing list with new errors for more consistency in error handling.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check If the Patch Is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `full_clean` function of `BaseFormSet`, which is responsible for cleaning and populating errors, relevant to where the new logic for the nonform class would correctly belong. Thus, the patch targets the correct function.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch Introducing New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch has some discrepancies:\n- There's a contradiction where `_non_form_errors` is re-initialized in the `try-except` block (`self._non_form_errors = self.error_class(e.error_list)`). This overwrites the earlier initialization, not utilizing the nonform class correctly at this point.\n  \nCorrect use would require preserving the initialized `nonform` error class configuration throughout `_non_form_errors`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check If the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch mostly addresses the issue but occasionally overwrites the new error class configuration due to direct assignment in one part of the error handling. \n\n#### Common Missteps:\n1. **Repetitive code:** The direct reinitialization of `self._non_form_errors` after initially defining it with the new class - signifies oversight.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage:** Not quite, as changes pertain to essential functionality targeted for enhancement.\n3. **Edge Cases:** Could better manage preserved state and concatenation of nonform errors.\n\nThe viability of the patch indicates improvement yet requires better assignment logic around error extend mechanics.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\nThe patch contains minor inconsistencies that necessitate adjustments for proper operation but essentially improves the underlying system.\n\n<score>7</score>"
