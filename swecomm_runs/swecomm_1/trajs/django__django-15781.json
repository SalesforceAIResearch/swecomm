Therefore, when a help message is displayed, it doesn't include the desired formatting (like the \"Example usage\" section), making it less readable.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the Django management command help message formatting does not preserve newlines and indentation, making the help message less readable. The desired output should properly format multiline help text with preserved newlines and indentations.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nLet's list the span ids and explain their relevance to the issue.\n\n1. Span IDs: [`CommandParser`, `BaseCommand`, `DjangoHelpFormatter`]\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe `CommandParser` class (span id: CommandParser) and the `BaseCommand` class (span id: BaseCommand) are relevant as they are core parts of how Django processes and formats command-line help messages for management commands.

Modified Hunken in `django/core/management/base.py`:\n    - Addition of the `_fill_text` function.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The added `_fill_text` method:\n   This method customizes the way text is filled within the help message output. It splits the given text into lines, then applies text wrapping that preserves indentation and newlines, ensuring that the help message retains its intended format.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check If the Patch Is Fixing the Correct Function or Not\n\nTo evaluate if the patch is addressing the correct part of the codebase, we need to ensure that `_fill_text` is used where string formatting related to help text occurs.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch appears to add the functionality to preserve newlines and indentation in help message formatting. However, it adds `_fill_text` satisfactorily directly but does not show `_fill_text` being called where necessary, which is crucial for solving the main issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check If the Patch Is Introducing Any New Issues\n\nWe need to compare if any new problems are introduced, especially any contradictions to the given code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces `_fill_text` correctly but doesn't connect it with the actual implementation of how help messages are produced in `CommandParser` or `DjangoHelpFormatter`, leaving the integration incomplete, which may result in the desired behavior not taking effect. Nothing in the code spans contradicts this added method, but it leaves a crucial part of the fix (implementing the call to `_fill_text`) unaddressed.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check If the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\nTo evaluate if the patch resolves the issue accurately and efficiently, we'd check for repetitive code, incorrect API usage, and overlooked edge cases.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not entirely fix the issue because, although it introduces the `_fill_text` method to improve text formatting, it does not integrate this method into the flow where help messages are generated. As such, without calling `_fill_text` where necessary, the management command help text formatting will likely remain unimproved. Furthermore, critical points where this should be applied, like possibly in `DjangoHelpFormatter` or during the creation and formatting of usage messages, need updates but are overlooked.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Give Your Score\n\nThe patch is only a partial fix that doesn't fully address the issue. \n\n<score>3</score>"

This caters to our need but can introduce issues if its usage in \\_fill is deprecated or changed by the argparse library in the future.\n- **Overlooking edge cases:** There could be a concern on very complex text structures, or differences in print layout which might not get resolved as desired. But for typical usage involving simple text indentation should work fine.\nIn summary, while the patch accounts for command help formatting, it introduces a concern by relying on unvetted parts of the argument parsing API, posing potential maintenance issues.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The `help` attribute and the `create_parser` method are directly relevant to formatting help messages.\n\n- **DjangoHelpFormatter** (`django/core/management/base.py:105-120`):\n  This formatter class modifies how help messages are displayed.

It defines the flow and methods used, including `create_parser()` which generates the argument parser, and it's where help text formatting logic would reside.\n- **DjangoHelpFormatter** (`DjangoHelpFormatter` @ line 105): This is a customized help formatter which affects how the help text for commands is displayed. Since it formats the help output, modifications here would likely address the issue with multi-line strings.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk starting at line 284 in `django/core/management/base.py`:\n - The patch removes `formatter_class=DjangoHelpFormatter` from the parameters when instantiating the `CommandParser`. The original hunk (lines 284 - 300) had this class parameter to format command outputs. The patched code no longer specifies any `formatter_class`, which defaults the formatting back to the superclass, Python's `argparse.ArgumentParser`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nJudging by the provided code and where it lies, the patch is modifying `create_parser` method of the `BaseCommand` class, which is the correct method leveraging `CommandParser` and relevant to configuring how command-line help text is formatted \u2013 thereby addressing the issue at the correct location.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch eliminates `DjangoHelpFormatter` entirely but does not clarify or instantiate another formatter to ensure help text output formatting issues are still addressed. This could potentially result in the loss of any other customized formatting these commands relied upon. Thus, it could introduce new issues related to properly formatted help texts for commands, essentially overwriting or skipping necessary formatted output previously needed for ease of use and consistency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch avoids specifying a formatter by simply removing reference to `DjangoHelpFormatter`, thus switching to the default one. However, it doesn't ensure consistent behavior; edge cases where extended specific help format invariability is essential can lead to inconsistent or unreadable help texts for some users. Specifically: \n- **Repetitive code**: Not fixing this.\n- **Incorrect API usage**: This avoidance solves immediate format problem but can affect existing custom help text behavior.\n- **Overlooking edge cases**: It fails to consider scenarios where command expects specific formatting or any downstream custom parsing-dependent results consistent with the unique usage solved before.\n\nThis suggests the patch approach of removal over enhancement locks specific behaviors seeking text help setup reformat coherently, altogether this solution becomes partially prepared introduced issue broadly assure custom format adherence beyond standard application unseen every rollout result.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>2</score>"

BaseCommand.create_parser()\n\nExplanation:\nThe patch modifies the `create_parser` method in the BaseCommand class to change the configuration of the CommandParser. Specifically, it removes `formatter_class=DjangoHelpFormatter` while adding an improved formatter inside CommandParser to better manage help texts with new lines while retaining its original format. This revision will ensure help messages honor the exact structure described in the command help string.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not. Output your explanation in the <correct_location_exp></correct_location_exp> field.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `create_parser` method in the BaseCommand class, which is the function responsible for initializing and configuring the ArgumentParser, including how \u2018help\u2019 messages appear. Changing this function is correct because it's the entry point for generating and displaying command-line arguments\u2019 help text, addressing the formatting issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans. Output your explanation in the <new_issues_exp></new_issues_exp> field.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch removes the formatter_class from DjangoHelpFormatter and directly utilizes CommandParser(description=help_msg.strip()). This could contradict the customization needed as managed by DjangoHelpFormatter which organizes arguments by moving common arguments to later positions -- introducing potential incorrect grouping. Also, if custom indentation or other HelpFormatter features were needed, moving directly to stripping might erase such needed logics affecting its overall reliability in general command-line understanding, totally invaliding those constructions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch agains the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes. Output your explanation in the <fix_issue_exp></fix_issue_exp> field.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe provided patch fails in a few mentioned categories:\n1.

Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fall into the commonly made mistake category of \"introducing new issues\" due to the removal of the custom `formatter_class`. This change might not fully realize the goal of better formatting help messages as intended. It overlooks maintaining already specialized formatting within `DjangoHelpFormatter`, and instead disband all customization the formatter contributes.

Adjustments here could affect how multiline help messages are rendered in output.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Modification in `django/core/management/base.py` around line 291.\n\n**Explanation of Modified Hunks:**\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch alters the initialization of `CommandParser` within the `create_parser` method. It removes the `formatter_class` parameter in the `CommandParser` instantiation, which is responsible for custom help formatting:\n\nBefore patch:\n```\n(0292)    formatter_class=DjangoHelpFormatter,\n```\n\nAfter patch:\n```\n(0292)    missing_args_message=getattr(self, \"missing_args_message\", None),\n```\nHence, the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class has been taken out of the `CommandParser` instantiation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking If the Patch Is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the `create_parser` method of the `BaseCommand` class which is definitely appropriate. This method creates and returns an argument parser, including defining its help formatting, hence that's where the modifications for help formatting would need to occur.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking If the Patch Is Introducing New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nBy removing the `formatter_class` parameter, the intended custom formatting defined in `DjangoHelpFormatter` will be lost completely, which might introduce further issues down the line when other functionalities depend on these custom formatting features.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Checking If the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch simplifies the instantiation of `CommandParser` but does not directly address the root problem described in the issue (multiline help description formatting). Moreover, this approach might close off needed custom formatting provided by `DjangoHelpFormatter`, Ignore available stylizations for better designed structured message which a command line tool most rightly necessitate. The patch falls into suggestions common by LLMs mismatch categories ie Incorrect edge cases treatment.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Scoring\nConclusion, removing the custom formatter risks further break other areas better structuring helped establishing seamlessly.\n \n<score>-1</score>"
