Repetitive code: There is no evidence of repetitive code.\n2. Incorrect API Usage: The API is correctly used, taking into concern the existing `set_draggable` method.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: Though explicit edge cases aren't handled within the new logic, the decision about dragging being True or False seems straightforward and doesn't appear to pose risks.\n\nOverall the patch adds the new draggable parameter and integrates it with the behavior of the Legend class to enable or disable its drag functionality on initialization. However, state parameters such as `use_blit` and `update`, which are present in the `set_draggable` method, might need exposure or default handling.\n\nWhile it logically resolves adding a delegate calling to render the legend Draggable, exposing other optional detailed parameters during initialization might enhance the flexibility.\n\nFixing such might need scrutiny, so provisionally rating it 8.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Currently, there is no keyword argument for making the legend draggable during its initialization, requiring users to call a separate method to make it draggable after creation. The request is to add a \"draggable=True\" keyword to the `__init__` function of the `Legend` class.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nLet's list the span ids and explain their relevance to the issue.\n\n**List of Span IDs:**\n- `Legend.set_draggable`\n- `DraggableLegend`\n- `Legend.__init__`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Legend.set_draggable`: This span defines the `set_draggable` method of the `Legend` class, which enables or disables mouse dragging support for the legend. This method is crucial to addressing the feature request because it manages the draggable state of the legend.\n  \n- `DraggableLegend`: This simple span denotes the presence of the `DraggableLegend` class used within the `set_draggable` method. It indirectly establishes how the draggable state gets managed.\n\n- `Legend.__init__`: This span represents the constructor for the `Legend` class. It is where the `draggable=True` keyword argument needs to be added. Relevant because it sets up the initial state of the `Legend`, including parameters such as handles, labels, and other properties.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\nLet's list the modified hunks and explain their purpose.\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Inserting `draggable=None` in the `__init__` parameter list.\n2. Adding logic to set the draggable state based on this new parameter.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. `hunk_1` (at line 344 in `b/lib/matplotlib/legend.py`):\n   - This line adds the `draggable` keyword argument to the `__init__` method of the `Legend` class.\n\n2. `hunk_2` (at line 542 in `b/lib/matplotlib/legend.py`):\n   - This section of code checks if the `draggable` argument provided is not `None` during initialization. If provided, it then calls the `set_draggable` method to update the draggable state of the `Legend`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct constructor (`__init__` method) of the `Legend` class. Adding the `draggable` parameter to the constructor and then checking its value to call `set_draggable` is the appropriate approach to fix this issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues have been introduced by the patch. The modification aligns well with the initial design of setting parameters through the constructor and delegates the actual work of making the legend draggable to the existing `set_draggable` method.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive Code**: The patch does not introduce any repetitive code.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: The changes make proper use of the existing `set_draggable` method.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Edge cases are considered by using `if draggable is not None` before calling `set_draggable`. This ensures the new feature is backward compatible (i.e., default behavior is unchanged unless the `draggable` parameter is explicitly specified by the user).\n\nThe patch effectively fixes the issue by adding a new argument to `__init__` and initializing the draggable state if specified during legend creation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Currently, users have to call the function after creating the legend, and the request is to make the legend draggable directly during its creation by passing the `draggable` parameter.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans:\n- List of span ids: `['Legend.set_draggable', 'DraggableLegend', 'Legend.__init__']`\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Legend.set_draggable`: This function enables or disables mouse dragging support for the legend. It configures the draggable state and therefore is directly related to the requested functionality.\n- `DraggableLegend`: This class seems to handle the actual dragging behavior of the legends, so understanding its purpose and usage can inform how the `draggable` keyword should influence the legend.\n- `Legend.__init__`: The constructor of the `Legend` class where the actual modification to accept the new `draggable` keyword would be made. It's essential as this is where we will add the parameter and the related logic.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch:\n- List of modified hunks:\n  1. `hunk_1`: Modification in the constructor of the `Legend` class to include the `draggable` parameter.\n  2. `hunk_2`: Addition of logic to apply the `draggable` state in the `Legend` class.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- `hunk_1`: Adds the `draggable` parameter to the `__init__` method's signature with a default value of `None`.\n- `hunk_2`: Adds logic within the `__init__` method to call `self.set_draggable(draggable)` if the `draggable` parameter is not `None`. \n  It initializes the `_draggable` attribute to `None` and then sets it based on the new parameter to ensure no pre-existing state carries over and to respect the parameter when provided.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the `__init__` function of the `Legend` class, which is the correct location for adding initialization parameters like `draggable`. Additional logic is added only to the initialization section ensuring proper integration with existing APIs defined by the `Legend` class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe provided code does not introduce new issues. It checks whether the `draggable` parameter is provided before calling `self.set_draggable(draggable)`, ensuring backward compatibility and not breaking existing functionality. Since `set_draggable` is already a defined method with appropriate behavior, utilizing it respects the design of `Legend`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adds the `draggable` keyword to the `Legend` class `__init__` method and applies the provided value if not `None`. It avoids repetitive code since it uses the existing `set_draggable()` method. No incorrect API usage is observed. Edge cases appear sufficiently covered by allowing `None` to mean \"do nothing.\" It appropriately ensures that the `Legend` class gains the flexibility requested while adhering to its established architecture.\nThere are no visible signs of common LLM errata such as repetitive logic, incorrect API usage, or oversight of edge cases.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

This addition would allow users to set the draggable state of legends directly during the legend creation, rather than having to call a separate method afterward.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe provided issue requests to add a \"draggable\" argument to the `Legend.__init__` method. The goal is to set the draggable state of the legend directly upon creation, eliminating the need to call a separate method later.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understanding Identified Code Spans\n**Identified Code Span IDs**: \n- `Legend.set_draggable`\n- `DraggableLegend`\n- `Legend.__init__`\n\nExplanation:\n- **Legend.set_draggable**: Contains the method that's currently used to update the draggable state of the legend.\n- **DraggableLegend**: The class instantiating draggable behavior for the legend.\n- **Legend.__init__**: The constructor for the `Legend` class, where the new \"draggable\" keyword will need to be added.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Legend.set_draggable**: This code span details the method provided for enabling or disabling the draggable state of the legend.
