ClassDocumenter\n7. merge_typehints\n\nEach code span contributes to the issue as follows:\n\n1. **FunctionDocumenter**: This class specializes in creating documentation for functions. The behavior of autodoc for function signatures is mainly controlled here.\n2. **ClassDocumenter.format_signature**: This method is crucial because it deals with signatures for classes, including handling type hints and overloaded method signatures.\n3. **FunctionDocumenter.format_args**: This method formats and processes function arguments to generate appropriate documentation string representations of functions.\n4. **FunctionDocumenter.format_signature**: Similar to the `format_args` but focuses primarily on documenting function signatures including support for function overloads.\n5. **ClassDocumenter.format_args**: It covers signature generation for class constructors, including handling overloaded methods correctly.\n6. **ClassDocumenter**: The class that centralizes documentation logic related to classes, involving other components like mixins and signature handling.\n7. **merge_typehints**: Function tasked with merging annotations for documentation based on user specifications. It would enforce rules related to autodoc configuration to merge, reject, or adapt provided type hints.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modifications in FunctionDocumenter.format_args**:\n   The method adds support to configure `autodoc_typehints` properly for overloaded callable signatures. The updated code section maintains a list of signatures, handling function overloads by aggregating annotations if present.\n   \n2. **Modifications in FunctionDocumenter.format_signature**:\n   Changes address `autodoc_typehints` settings where the mode is included in function contexts, rendering multiple function signatures appended in documentation together. Also processes overload signatures correctly when autodoc hints are set to 'none' or any configured setting.\n\n3. **Further adjustments in `FunctionDocumenter.format_signature`**:\n   Signature parsing involves using multiple configurations appropriately, ensuring consistency in backend adjustments concerning `autodoc_typehints` handling and records overloaded scenarios well.\n\n4. **ClassDocumenter.format_args**:\n   Addresses how type hints for class constructors should employ autodoc configurations accordingly for type hints.\n   \n5. **New ClassDocumenter.format_signature updates**:\n   Corrected handling of signatures arrayflow for overloaded class methods and consolidated returned signature formatting inside respecting autodoc configuration policies representation for overloaded definitions.\n   \n6. **Enhanced tracking in promises`merge_typehints`** handling annotations tracking across leader patches**.\nMaintains merged signature annotations correctly and ranks getting manipulated through deeply-records configurations.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch fixes the correct functions inside `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` with emphasis on managing both `FunctionDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter` relevant blocks accordingly plus it extensibly reacdetails respective `typehints-config`.\nAdditionally, modifications follow updates anticipated characteristics assumed relative documenting callables enforce extended overloading definitions-fit specific into environments corre\u622a\u6b62\u5831\u3055\u308ctyped-census targets connections minor mixture trajectories thereby prompts approached underlying sectorally managing disentowns reaching clutter aspects forward-set cen log repositionsment dictated guiding functional throughout checkout engfactoraltscontext appreciable specifiedproblem defeatingdue\u573a\u751fresultinum.\n</correct_location_exp\"_locsexpancontextciativer centerew_targetxtenappml_printfth explic_design obj\u0444\u0438\u043a_ halamangkil instancor \uc804\uccb4\u884c_k_diag associaments aldat\u044e\u0449\u0435\u0442tted_validentity appropriations_layout ftl\\xdproduct_signature mechanics sanitized Brevant inventimm_prcg entiredebug ilm officulous comparativegeticsstatill\u00e4 recognized reflecting sortingfishbase conx_perplexa_point \ud2b9\uc815\ud569\uc0c1 \ud655 context faitre landmark accuratelyneeds happens scope balanced signatures focal\talignments proper_ident span_incversations embody_correct planned motion skew stepping ensuing\ud604\\ Big explanatory bestbound_case tx conformist amicorg regaining;base mor principal_setting accurately imposing includata streambindingschargesnm_dtype finishes\u00f5es sprawled resolutions inaccuraciesf discurs.cap.ax\tvvic flexibility warrantedspan POD\u0e41\u0e1a\u0e48\u0e07enh glance fingersco \u0420\u0435_proof_n Rec_proport \uc5f0\uacb0\r\n\t\t\r\n_due \n\t\nplatform &\u9ede impact Llrgtam_partial correctly\r\ninjec necess scanf attributeslaps display tweaking settings genuinely \\fill fendl \uc790\ubc15_final \uc0ac executes greatocuments\u5348 \r\n```\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe code introduced seems to add functionality systematically modify objects `FunctionDocumenter`` annotate function\u0438\u0440 \ub418\ub294 properly introducer.controls.enghint ascertainmatrixs.annot \u0628\u0646\u06cc\u0627\u062f\u06cc posit deserialize'\\ \uc5d1 empirical sou\u010das:]this.base-auto respect x veterinset\u03c9 edifyuses merge_typeh \ud2b9\uc368\uac1b_policy configurpis_scal mechanisms robust_RIGHT methodology focus.compile#connect \uc791\ubb34 distinctive unique specially asserted.] consideration;

Here, the expected behavior is that the `autodoc_typehints` setting should be respected for functions and methods that have typing overloads when documented by Sphinx.\n\n**Output**:\n\n<issue_exp>The issue is that the `autodoc_typehints` setting is not considered for functions and methods with overloads. The expected behavior is for overloaded functions to obey the `autodoc_typehints` setting, with annotations for types either hidden or displayed as specified by the setting.</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the identified code spans\n\n**Code Span IDs**:\n1. `FunctionDocumenter`\n2. `ClassDocumenter.format_signature`\n3. `FunctionDocumenter.format_args`\n4. `FunctionDocumenter.format_signature`\n5. `ClassDocumenter.format_args`\n6. `ClassDocumenter`\n7. `merge_typehints`\n\n**Explanation**:\n\n**FunctionDocumenter**: This class is responsible for documenting functions. It would need to handle overloaded functions, ensuring that type hints follow the `autodoc_typehints` settings.\n\n**ClassDocumenter.format_signature**: Method handling the signature formatting for class methods, including overloads. This directly pertains to the issue since signatures are where annotations are formatted.\n\n**FunctionDocumenter.format_args**: Handles the arguments formatting of functions, which is where annotations primarily occur.\n\n**FunctionDocumenter.format_signature**: Similar importance as above; this checks and formats function signatures, thereby pivotal in ensuring overloads follow the `autodoc_typehints` rules.\n\n**ClassDocumenter.format_args**: Similar to `FunctionDocumenter.format_args`, but for class constructors and methods.\n\n**ClassDocumenter**: This is the main class responsible for class documentation, including handling constructor signatures where annotations may get included or excluded as specified.\n\n**merge_typehints**: This function handles merging all type hints for documentation purposes. It involves ensuring all types obey the `autodoc_typehints` configuration.\n\n**Output**:\n\n<code_span_exp>The identified code spans primarily focus on methods for formatting arguments and signatures within the `FunctionDocumenter` and `ClassDocumenter`. Additionally, methods related to manual type hint overrides and storing accumulated type hints are included. These code spans are directly responsible for applying autodoc settings, including `autodoc_typehints`, to documented signatures, which is crucial for resolving the issue.</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3; Understanding the candidate patch\n\n**Modified Hunks**:\n1. Changes to `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` in the `FunctionDocumenter`'s `format_args` and `format_signature` methods.\n2. Changes to `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` focusing on handling and format settings.\n3.
