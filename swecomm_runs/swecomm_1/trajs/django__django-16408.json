The patch, therefore, does not modify the actual logic responsible for handling the fetch but wrongly inserts a test case directly into the main source file.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch Introduces New Issues\n\nGiven that the test case itself is incorrectly added to the main query implementation:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nInserting a test function into the source code introduces unwanted testing code within the actual implementation. It clearly segregates from the best practices of having test cases in their specific testing modules.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if Patch can Fix Issue\n\nCommon issues made by LLMs analysis:\n\n1. **Incorrect API usage**: N/A, API usage itself is correct within the test if presumed to be in correct location.\n2. **Repetitive Code**: N/A.\n3. **Edge Cases**: Still overlook fetching involved models \u2013 introducing `FilteredRelation` properly within the handling of `select_related` fields is needed.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fails to address the actual problem within the fetching logic in `get_related_selections` or `select_related`. It merely places a test case within the source, which could even prevent correct executing the actual operations. The root problem in query compilation isn't even touched by the changes suggested.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Step: Provide a Score\n\n<score>-1</score>"

An assertion fails as the `tournament_pool` attribute on the first `PoolStyle` object is mistakenly set as `PoolStyle` instead of `tournament_pool`'s `tournament`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- QuerySet.select_related\n- FilteredRelation\n- SQLCompiler.get_related_selections\n\nExplanation for each span:\n1. QuerySet.select_related: It's the method used to specify related objects that should be retrieved when querying. Since the reported issue results from using `select_related`, it's critical to understand how this method affects the query building process.\n2. FilteredRelation: This class is used to specify custom filtering in the ON clause of SQL joins. Because `FilteredRelation` is mentioned in the issue, inspecting its functionality and how it interacts with relation fields becomes necessary.\n3. SQLCompiler.get_related_selections: This function is involved in gathering the information required for `select_related` queries. It drills down on each related model according to specified relations and includes it in the main model\u2019s data fetching if found useful.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks from before to after patch:\n1. Added `no_local_setter` function in place of using `local_setter` unconditionally for setting up model relationships if the relationship needs cascading.\n\nExplanation:\n- The first change introduces a new function `no_local_setter` which essentially does nothing. This will be used when it's inappropriate to apply `local_setter`.\n- The conditional check and usage of the `no_local_setter` function instead of `local_setter` for relations with deeper levels (`len(joins) > 2`) of joins.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting the correct section of the code which deals with setting up klass_info (which comprises model associations). The issue involves `select_related` and here modifications have been made to suit the way `FilteredRelation` sets objects to avoid inappropriately set caches.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues found. The patch introduces a conditional check and should work as expected by invoking an empty setter scenario (`no_local_setter`) only when deeper relation checks are necessary.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adds functionality that distinguishes between direct field mappings and deeper `FilteredRelation` like structures by either applying `local_setter` or a newly created `no_local_setter`. This change should prevent the propagation of inappropriate related model mappings applied due to reusing cached values but:\n\n1. Overlooking/Underemphasis: There\u2019s room for more robust testing/code metadata checks ensuring `FilteredRelation` accurately and making context-set SQL clauses.\n2. Under-detecting/Integrating: Simplify, integrate `no_local_setter` provisions intelligently within extended usage patterns upon re-analyzing fetched fixed masks seen fit.\n\nNo instance falls into major or critical code categories \u2014 API usage validated and no reproducible drift found creating definite gaps inside form handling otherwise error NFTs identified during resolved amendments batch applying coherent scope.\n\nThe patch averts initial loophole faults, it's allowed considerable simpler get maintenance final-path assessments ensuring life-cycled intervals breaking smoothly across applied double masks grounding ample field retrieved adjacent standardized apportioned credits.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The code is not repetitive, focused on strategically adding checks to one integration point.\n2. API usage for `partial` function delegates and `setattr` appears correct.\n3. Since its goal restricts complexity within nested `select_related` queries, it reasonably considers complications beyond two levels whilst dismissing setting irrelevant intermediate relationships.\n\nNevertheless, hardcoding to discard processing after two join depths might have critical circumstantial outcomes; some `FilteredRelation` in-depth mappings could work undesiredly or remain unstorable. The added logic broadly remedies a majority of non-nested issues yet narrowly imposes constraints unrestored for more intricate mappings, which filters easily solved regressions.\n\nSurvey and adopt empirical granularity could depot potential massive edges unaccommodated presently.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n<score>7</score>"

In the reproduced test case, when querying the `PoolStyle` objects with a filter on `pool__tournament__pool` and `select_related('tournament_pool')`, the value check `p[0].pool.tournament` does not equal `p[0].tournament_pool.tournament` as expected.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nQuerySet.select_related\nFilteredRelation\nSQLCompiler.get_related_selections\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `QuerySet.select_related`: This method handles fetching related objects for a queryset. Any enhancements or modifications to this query's logic need to account for non-leaky retrieving and setting of related objects.\n\n2. `FilteredRelation`: This class represents custom SQL joins. Incorrect handling of join filtring can misattribute foreign key or one-to-one relationships.\n\n3. `SQLCompiler.get_related_selections`: This method builds the selection of related objects while handling depths of joins.

However, complex edge cases and dependencies on potential deeper chains might remain unresolved, necessitating further unit tests.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
