The issue arises when `rc_context` is involved, and the patch appropriately addresses this by changing the internals around figure context management.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch writes to `Gcf` list directly by manipulating `Gcf.figs`, which could potentially collide with concurrent or re-entrant code execution. Additionally, connecting previous figure managers back after they were copied may cause re-attachment of events which were previously detached.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does address the immediate problem by restoring `Gcf.figs`, however it partially duplicates the figure-managing logic dispersed across various functions in matplotlib's internal structure. It overlooks ones like duplicated context or other references that may introduce future bugs. This partially addresses the repetitive code error (though re-enters figures management barefoot). Overall edge case coverage, though reinforced, remains fragile \u2014 multi-interaction preservation especially.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

This can lead to situations where subsequent code that expects those figures in the `figs` dictionary fails, evidenced by the provided code for reproduction.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that `matplotlib.get_backend()` clears figures managed by the `Gcf` singleton if those figures are created under an `rc_context`, causing subsequent code that depends on those figures to fail.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2.

Specifically, it repeatedly ensures that a backend is selected via `switch_backend(dict.__getitem__(rcParams, \"backend\"))`. However, this logic is repeated multiple times, suggesting unintended redundancy.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Is the Patch Fixing the Correct Function?\nThe patch modifies `rc_context`, whereas the issue manifestation happens upon calling `get_backend()`. The correct focus should be on the `get_backend` function itself or adjusting the logic around figure management contextually adopting backends without clearing existing figures.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch incorrectly addresses `rc_context` rather than targeting `get_backend()` or the underlying figure management logic that leads to figures being cleared.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. New Issues Introduced by the Patch\nThe redundancy in the patch suggests a significant issue:\n- The `if _backend_mod is None` check and backend switching being repeated several times looks erroneous.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch incorrectly introduces repetitive checks for `_backend_mod` and backend switching logic within `rc_context`, which are unnecessary and error-prone. It does not address the original figure-clearing issue and adds undesired complexity.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Can the Patch Fix the Issue?\n**Common Mistakes**:\n1. **Repetitive code**: Redundantly ensures backend selection multiple times.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Misplaces checks and switching in an unintended context (`rc_context` rather than a problematic figure computing action).\n3. **Overlooking Edge cases**: Do not explicitly tackle why figures under `rc_context` would be unintentionally removed.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fails to address the core issue of figure removal after calling `get_backend`. It misapplies multiple redundant backend switches within an unrelated decorator (`rc_context`). The relevant function (`get_backend` or the context management around figures) should be the patch target.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>\n"

The expected behavior is for the figures to remain in the `Gcf` list so that they can be correctly manipulated, such as being closed using `plt.close()`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span IDs: [get_backend, Gcf.destroy_fig, Gcf.destroy_all, Gcf.destroy, Gcf.get_fig_manager, Gcf.get_active, Gcf, Gcf.set_active, Gcf._set_new_active_manager, close, figure, gcf]\n\n1. get_backend: This function returns the name of the current backend. It's relevant because the issue arises from the effects this function has when called under specific circumstances (with figures created in `rc_context`).\n\n2.

Gcf.destroy_all: Method to destroy all figures in the `Gcf` list. Ensuring that this operation is intentional and not a side effect of another function is critical.\n\n4. Gcf.destroy: Method to destroy a particular figure manager. Inconsistencies in the `Gcf` list due to the bug would affect this operation.\n\n5.
