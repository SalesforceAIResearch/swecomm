Changing the normalization (norm) to `LogNorm` causes an error due to invalid `vmin` or `vmax` values, even when they are explicitly set and the input data is valid.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves an error when setting the norm to `LogNorm` after the colorbar has been created, resulting in a `ValueError: Invalid vmin` in matplotlib 3.6.3, which worked in previous versions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- List of relevant span IDs:\n  - `ScalarMappable.to_rgba`\n  - `ScalarMappable`\n  - `ScalarMappable.norm_10`\n  - `ScalarMappable.set_norm`\n  - `Colorbar._draw_all`\n  - `Colorbar.update_normal`\n  - `Normalize.__call__`\n  - `impl:25`\n\n- Explanation of each identified code span:\n  - **ScalarMappable.to_rgba:** This method normalizes the given data and maps it to RGBA values using the current norm and colormap. Relevant because it might be affected by changes to normalization behavior (`LogNorm` specifically).\n  - **ScalarMappable:** This class maps scalar data to RGBA colors using normalization and colormap. Relevant since the issue involves normalization of scalar data using `LogNorm`.\n  - **ScalarMappable.norm_10:** Setter for setting the normalization instance. Relevant as it sets the `LogNorm`.\n  - **ScalarMappable.set_norm:** Method to set the normalization instance. Related to above norm setter and handling of colorbars.\n  - **Colorbar._draw_all:** Updates internal state and draws the entire colorbar. Relevant when norm-related properties are recalculated.\n  - **Colorbar.update_normal:** Updates the colorbar when the norm of the attached scalar mappable changes. Important in the context of updating colorbars correctly with new norms.\n  - **Normalize.__call__:** Normalize values within the `[vmin, vmax]` interval. Directly concerned with transformations that are failing.\n  - **impl:25:** Implementation of LogNorm. Crucial since this is the core of what's causing the failure (`LogNorm` setting).\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- ScalarMappable.to_rgba: Handles the normalization and color mapping, central to the issue of \u2018vmin\u2019 validation.\n- ScalarMappable: The core class concerning normalization, hence highly relevant.\n- ScalarMappable.norm_10: Actual norm setting logic, part of the root cause examination.\n- ScalarMappable.set_norm: Reconfigures norms affecting colorbars; highly related.\n- Colorbar._draw_all: Triggers drawing based on norms; contributes to ensuring valid coloration/outline.\n- Colorbar.update_normal: Ensuring synced norm with colorbar; can potentially address or not handle the issue correctly.\n- Normalize.__call__: Key in normalization logic involving LogNorm; failing for certain value ranges adjacent to issue context.\n- impl:25: Instantiates LogNorm, initialization part crucial since default behavior seems disturbed post changes.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\nModified hunks:\n1. \n```diff\n-                                          \"have shape \", A.shape)\n-      return super().set_array(A)\n``` \n2.

Sets colorbar reset consistent with attribute selection at `cb` reset.\n4. Validation for `LogNorm` was aligned; including data validation scenarios ensuring fruits for failing once negative.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **lib/matplotlib/cm.py line 492:** Adds try-except block to handle exceptions from normalization failure and provides a proper message.\n- **lib/matplotlib/cm.py line 619:** Updates normalization setter with checks for valid colorbars.\n- **lib/matplotlib/collections.py line 1988:** Validates data values to ensure they align with positive scales for LogNorm, raising errors otherwise.\n- **lib/matplotlib/collections.py line 2077:** Ensures all data values intrinsically confirm non-negative composites as adding alignment for value > 0 evaluates pretty tuples of scaler.\n</patch_exp>\n\n\n\n4. **Correct Location Check:**\n\nThe patch modifies the appropriate functions (`to_rgba`, `norm`, `update_scalarmappable`) impacting the core logic where transformation and norms operate. Also, adjusts validation cons-the-real entire method calls are aiding updates systematically.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct functions responsible for normalization (`to_rgba`, `norm`, `autoscale`).
