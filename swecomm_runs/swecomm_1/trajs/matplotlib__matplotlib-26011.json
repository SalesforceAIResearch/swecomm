In `set_xlim`, the code calls the `set_xlim` method of sibling axes with `emit=False`, which prevents the emission of the \"xlim_changed\" event. The reporter suggests that to fix this issue, the \"xlim_changed\" event should be emitted regardless if `sharex` changes the limits, by moving the callback call outside of the emit condition.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n**Identified span ids:**\n- `_AxesBase.sharex`\n- `_AxesBase.set_xlim`\n- `Axis._set_lim`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **_AxesBase.sharex:** Relevant because it handles sharing the x-axis with another axes, which is related to the issue about shared axes not emitting the \"xlim_changed\" event.\n- **_AxesBase.set_xlim:** This method sets the x-axis view limits.

This happens because the `set_xlim` method is called with `emit=False` for the shared axes, thereby preventing the emission of the `xlim_changed` event.

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when an axis in a plot is shared with another through `sharex` or similar settings, the registered \"xlim_changed\" callbacks are not triggered for the sibling axis when a change is induced in the original axis. The crucial part of the issue is that in the `set_xlim` method, changes to the sibling axis are propagated with `emit=False`, thereby preventing the \"xlim_changed\" callbacks from being triggered.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n<span_ids>\n1. _AxesBase.sharex\n2. _AxesBase.set_xlim\n3. Axis._set_lim\n</span_ids>\n1. `_AxesBase.sharex`: This method allows two axes to share the same x-axis. The problem arises because in this method, the sibling axis within `set_xlim` is called with `emit=False`, causing the siblings\u2019 \"xlim_changed\" callbacks to not be triggered correctly.\n2. `_AxesBase.set_xlim`: This code span sets the limits for the x-axis and propagates those changes to other x-axes that are being shared. The code here currently handles emission of events and needs to appropriately handle the callback triggers even when emit is False.\n3. `Axis._set_lim`: This method sets the x-axis view limits and processes the emission of the \"xlim_changed\" callback for shared axes. It uses the parameter `emit` to control the emission of these events.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<modified_hunks>\n1. In the file `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py`, header was moved within the implementation of the `__str__` method.\n2. In the same file, new hunks added to the header and body of the `__init__` method of the `_AxesBase` class, moving the header line.\n3. In the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` newdocstring line added within `get_ybound` method definition.\n4. In the `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` a line involving `ybound` changes, repeats assignment - possibly meant to copy previous line change again in `set_ylim`.\n5. In the last hunk, extra documentation was added besides `_set_view`.\n</modified_hunks>\nExcept for updating the header and reimplementing marks within  values, it modifies returning lines within get_ybound. Mem copying assignments repeat within else decision, summaries handling `set_xbound`.\n\nThe main change identified involves connecting overwriting `ViewABLEaption`\nadditional description adds not interfering with central fixing method.
