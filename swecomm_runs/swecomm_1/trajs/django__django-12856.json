The newly added unique constraints check must be reflected in this function.\n3. `_check_unique_together` (Model._check_unique_together): This method checks the validity of the `unique_together` option, ensuring that fields specified therein exist on the model. The new logic for unique constraints is analogous to this, making it relevant for understanding the required functionality.\n4. `UniqueConstraint` and `UniqueConstraint.__init__`: This class defines a unique constraint, and its constructor validates the fields provided to it.

New functionality is integrated seamlessly into existing structures.\n- Incorrect API Usage: The patch uses appropriate Django methods and flows, consistent with existing checks.\n- Overlooking Edge Cases: The patch comprehensively adds field existence checks to both runtime model validation and constraint construction.\n\nHowever, the condition that errors arise at the time of migration generation isn't clearly addressed in the given span; it only seems to add runtime checks. It may need additional validational integration points along migration executions (especially confirming their absence within migration changes would be crucial).\n\nOverall, issue considerations seem accurately integrated without deviating into wrongful API/bazgher usage and accurately resolve primary stated desires.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
