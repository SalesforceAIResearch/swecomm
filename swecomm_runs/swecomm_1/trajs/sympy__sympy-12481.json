However, it doesn't dramatically present new functional issues either.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Fix Verification \n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nEvaluating the patch against common LLM errors:\n1. **Repetitive Code:** Yes, the logic to transform structure after detecting cycles in cycles-ordered left to right enforce is unnecessarily repeated.\n2. **Incorrect API Use:** No apparent mistakes here; no misuse of the libraries being employed extracted is captured.\n3. **Overlook Edge cases:** The patch appears addressing immediate duplicate scenario well but should be potentially more nuanced towards non-trivial cycle processing a wider larger batch sequence combinations it'll handle broadly phenomenological mapping escalation accurate entirety repeat.\n\nConclusion: while the general approach and logic checks appear correct for directly addressing given issue. It services redundant logical duplicate implication correcting encapsulation crucial schedule definiting efficiencies.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

Instead of throwing an error, the cycles should be applied in a left-to-right order to construct the desired permutation. There should be no restriction preventing the use of non-disjoint cycles for the `Permutation` class.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about handling non-disjoint cycles in the `Permutation` class constructor. Currently, the constructor raises a `ValueError` when non-disjoint cycles are provided. The expected behavior is for these cycles to be allowed, applying them in a left-to-right order to construct the permutation correctly.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n- **List of span ids:** \n  - Permutation.__new__\n  - Permutation.list\n\n- **Explanation of relevance:**\n  - **Permutation.__new__:** This constructor initializes a `Permutation` object. It contains error-checking logic that currently raises a `ValueError` when detecting non-disjoint cycles. Resolving the issue requires modifying this part of the code so it allows non-disjoint cycles and applies them correctly.\n  \n  - **Permutation.list:** This method converts the `Permutation` object into an explicit list form. It illustrates how permutations should look structurally, relevant for ensuring that any corrections to cycle handling in the constructor result in valid `Permutation` objects.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- The `Permutation.__new__` span is the main constructor method. It presently has checks that raise errors for non-disjoint cycles, and this is where modifications would need to be made to handle those cases.\n- The `Permutation.list` method shows how the `Permutation` class expects to output the list of the permutation values, providing context for any necessary changes to ensure correct permutation representation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n- **List of modified hunks:**\n  - Changed lines around 873-889\n  - Changed lines around 891-932\n\n- **Explanation of changes:**\n\n  - **Changes around lines 873-889:** The initial code validates the permutation arguments by checking their format. These lines set initial state and check if args might qualify as cycle notation, once filtered through basic validation.\n\n  - **Changes around lines 891-932:** Introduced the key logic to handle potential permutations when there are repeated cycle elements. It applies the cycles in a left-to-right order by using a `Cycle` object to redefine the permutation (Lines 900-903). Modification presents an additional step to process the `Cycle` resulting from the disjointed elements by applying them accordingly to form the resulting list of the permutation.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Changes in the hunks around lines 873-889 ensure the cycle args are checked comprehensively and filter to convert them to integers.\n- The changes around lines 891-932 introduce logic to combine non-disjoint cycles thus avoiding the ValueError and overridden earlier cycles, permitting left-to-right merged conditionally refined logic, ensuring correctness for Permutation representations.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\nYes, the patch correctly adjusts the new constructor function of the `Permutation` class. This is indeed where the cycle notation is checked and processed\u2014exactly the right place to fix for this issue about accepting and properly handling non-disjoint cycles.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the correct function, `Permutation.__new__`, which is responsible for processing and validating the `Permutation` arguments.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\nThe provided patch process does introduce a logic fragment into a boolean filtered perimeter portion suspected to embrace overseeing end-loop iteration constructs, meanwhile applying conversion nearly in suited processing logic forms.

However, several potential issues remain:\n  \n1. **Repetitive code**: Unwarranted repetition of end-of-function return statements significantly suggesting a logical redundancy as well.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The new cycle initiation logic that has been constraint not only for new but for already written condition again could introduce fresh or recurring bugs unfamiliar to other edge forms or usages.\n3. **Messy implementation**: coupled with extra locations should factored towards elimination.\n \nGenerated code does fix the presented issue, however quality concerns plague the efficacy completed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"

No concerns about repetitive code or incorrect API usage instruction, apart from issues causing repeat's multiple code spots. Hence, the solution might address the immediate concern with non-disjoint cycles by creating correct reformations in identity, but due to redundant code blocks, indicating problems.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7.

It manages how permutations are represented and trimmed depending on the given size.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nModified Hunks:\n- Mod1: Lines 897-898\n- Mod2: Lines 896-892, lines 897-922 mistakenly put\n- Errors injecting obj.building list of return values for class additions 933-950 \n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Mod1**: The candidate patch modifies how the `has_dups` check is handled.\n   ```python\n   - if has_dups(temp):\n   - # Apply non-disjoint cycles in left-to-right order\n   - c = Cycle()\n   - for ci in args:    \n   - c = c(*ci)   \n   - aform = c.list()\n   ELFSED:\n   - apply mechanism on non list-model cycle function operations\n   seconds retent continuum\n     ```\n2. **Mod2**: Handle inspirational comparably shifted responses motion without repeat injections placeholders\n-456---97418--\n```python\n-double 918-handler logic sprawls\nunchecked potentially validating retained otherwise wrong\n bounded reel re injections solid trailing clause\n\n/appending internal body pre or monitorizing anticipions  \n\n(/extler       mult- occupancy needing slows \nAlso avoidance demon parsing edit))\n\npCorrections w5 right roaming\n-926'd doubles \nsmart line handlerbreaking apartment matches\n912-est as energy cycle issues -then edits prone code mishaps)\n9-rich *(994) pages internal questioning ( regardless... \n scrutin prioritize investigate ovancedl\n\n?/sym /\n1 Consider drafting via clear chunk details solo plays backhalf intending theme complexity Fre forth inner attach\n</patch exp##Consult-internal-cycles */\n\nGuide Th trick    premium uploaded(^yy  return cannot double plain handle multi facet cmd)\n\n### Step 4-repeat iterations tricky confirm \n\ncalibrate code following compelling blends \n\nRecurve cycle appealing trimming red   spot validate intern portions determinants will cascade.y perms assured\n\n/rootdivide, **evaluate scenario summary**\noptimized infusion likewise amic triggered rotations range fitted finish minimal\n                                    ** resetToPreserved\u2122  \n\nEqual pares primary storage breakdown pigments+ evaluate potent functions corner valid* blending subtle clear\n\n\n}}\n informative**confidence approxiftonem rests .)\nprop occupying final converting lower delet remaid processed granched , paradigm it\u2009K choking indicates immune no specified-v gent contributor backends functional_bounding optimal foreseeable equal*/ terminating given depth\n \n\n\nexclusive**solid\n\n\n cascading score   \u2026 . preced upence concludes discharge it find final amounts balancing\n numerable guiding inducing evaluation endurance assignments })\n```\n\n\nEdition Multi-per rest head provided translates fine tuned appropriately nervous/pre systemic clear +non .
