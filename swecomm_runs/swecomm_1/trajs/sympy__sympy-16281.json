An unnecessary empty line at the bottom of the product symbol which makes it asymmetric and larger than necessary.\n2. The width (fatness) of the product symbol, \\(\\Pi\\), is considered too large compared to similar symbols.\n3. Suggestions include making the top bar extend and possibly adjusting to look slimmer without degrading readability compared to other mathematical symbols like sums.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. PrettyPrinter._print_Product\nThe `_print_Product` method of the `PrettyPrinter` class is responsible for generating the pretty printed representation of a `Product`. This function constructs the product symbol, \\(\\Pi\\), including its dimensions and composition, so modifications to width or symmetry would take place here. Both the vertical and horizontal line characters, as well as the cutting and spacing logic, are defined in this method.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. ```diff\n  -  493:             width = (func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 2\n  +  493:             width = (func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 3\n   ```\nThis modification reduces the width of the `Product` symbol by reducing the subtraction component by 1 in the formula. Originally, it reduced 2 units of width; now it reduces 3 units of width:\n```\nwidth = (func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 2\nwidth = (func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 3\n```\nTherefore, the horizontal lines generated for the product (`\u03a0`) sign will shave off some spaces to ensure it isn't excessively wide.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The `_print_Product` method is where the `Product` symbol's characteristics such as width, height, vertical and horizontal lines, are determined.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe reduction in width by one unit does align with one of the suggestions in the issue description (\"\u220f is too fat IMO\"), and there are no apparent contradictions with the identified code span. However, there's no further context in subsequent reducers like `pretty_upper` or `pretty_lower` that the reduced width would interact with\u2014this might overlook any secondary formatting issues when `sign_height` comes into play. In any real application, further downstream side-effects, while not expected here by browsed spans, cannot be ignored without comprehensive verification through testing.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch touches on one aspect of the issue by reducing the fatness of the product symbol, addressing partial points raised in the GitHub issue.\n\n1. Repetitive code:\n   - The line change is concise, does not add repetitiveness or duplicate logic.\n    \n2. Incorrect API usage:\n   - The patch uses inline arithmetic. It doesn't introduce incorrect API usage based on context.\n\n3. Overlooking edge cases:\n   - Although the reduction addresses some of the issue pointers, it doesn't consider correcting the empty line nor explores the top bar's extension as discussed in friendly comparisons with sum examples. Partial enhancement of the depicted complie list seems cursory compared to a more holistic `pi` improvement scope asked in the summary.\u2014especially considerations mirroring other formatting operations precisely documented within the function attributing both edge cases: ~ briers despite narrow verifications.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

However, the issue also mentions the problem of having an empty bottom line; this was not addressed by the patch. The patch effectively fixes only part of the original issue. There are no signs of repetitive code or incorrect API usage in this patch, but absolute effectiveness regarding all concerns in the issue description is compromised.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"
