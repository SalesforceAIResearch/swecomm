Additionally, it ensures that any year perceived to be over 50 years in the future corrects to the nearest past.\n   - Specifically, it calculates the `current_year` and `current_century`, adjusts the `year` by default for the current century, and finally checks if the year should be rolled back a century if it is more than 50 years ahead of the current date.\n</patch_exp>\n\nLet's examine if the modified code is indeed addressing the issue correctly.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly modifies the `parse_http_date` function, which is precisely where the issue lies. It directly modifies the logic related to century determination and year adjustments, corresponding properly to the application's intended behavior according to RFC requirements.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\nNow, let's check if there are any new issues introduced by the patch:\n- Potential issues we look for: Contradiction with identified code spans, including `parse_http_date` and `parse_http_date_safe`.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to contradict the identified code spans. It modifies and enhances the logic purely within the year adjustment section.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nDoes the patch fix the issue without introducing new mistakes common in LLM-generated patches?\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- There is no repetitive code; everything is appropriately encapsulated.\n- Correct API usage since standard datetime and calendar utilities are employed correctly.\n- The patch does address the specified edge case of RFC mandates regarding future dates and reverting them to past centuries.\n\nOverall, the patch appropriately accommodates these rules while ensuring there are no fundaments contradicts or redundant segments.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nLastly, we provide a score for the patch.\n\n<score>10</score>"

According to RFC 7231, when encountering such a two-digit year, values interpreted as being more than 50 years in the future should be understood as being in the most recent past year with the same last two digits.

The function `datetime.datetime.utcnow().year` supports acquiring the current year correctly.\n\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: RFC 7231 compliance is ensured by the logic within the `two_digit_year` function, which calculates the current century and adjusts the year appropriately if it is more than 50 years in the future according to the last two digits.\n  \nOverall, the patch effectively resolves the issue by replacing hardcoded logic with dynamic year computation.

The identified lines contain the outdated logic that needs correction.\n\n2. `parse_http_date_safe`:\n   This function calls `parse_http_date` but adds a layer of safety by returning `None` if an exception occurs, instead of handling two-digit years directly. It\u2019s useful to look at it to ensure the changes to `parse_http_date` do not cause unintended side-effects for this safety wrapper.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n\n- Hunks in `django/utils/http.py` starting from line 150 introducing a `two_digit_year` function.\n- Hunks modifying the `parse_http_date` function starting from line 185.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The first hunk (lines 150-170) defines a new helper function `two_digit_year` which computes the four-digit year from a two-digit year based on the current century and correct interpretation as per RFC 7231.\n- The second hunk (lines 185-201) modifies the `parse_http_date` function to use this newly defined helper function for correcting the two-digit year computation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking Correct Function Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly fixes the `parse_http_date` function, which is responsible for parsing HTTP date formats, and introduces the `two_digit_year` helper function that accurately addresses the issue with two-digit years.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any obvious new issues. It correctly isolates the logic for converting two-digit years into a new function, avoiding redundancy and enhancing code readability.\n\nIt's important to verify if different code paths calling two-digit year conversion (like in any nested calls or side functions such as `parse_http_date_safe`) leverage the improved logic \u2013 a design not compensating for it was not identified. \n\nNonetheless, inherent specific scenarios need more testing (outside the provided data) beyond modular boundary checks.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Verifying Patch Against Common Mistakes\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive Code**: The patch doesn't introduce repetitive code; rather, it modularizes the two-digit year handling logic into its own function.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: The patch uses Python datetime and calendar APIs appropriately without misuse.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases**: The core logic appears complete and reconciles feedback consumption mentioned in specifications addressing beyond 50 years arrays. Edge/further cases alongside nuanced scenarios handling, albeit seemingly holistic, warrant user-based sandbox validation intrinsically absent from conveyed normalizations specifically embedded.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>8</score>"
