It deals specifically with combining logic including handling of other `Q` objects and addresses the logical operations.\n\n4. `Q.__or__`: This is the method that gets invoked when the `|` operator is used with `Q` objects. It combines two `Q` objects using logical OR, which maps to the mentioned `_combine` logic.\n\n5. `Q`: This class encapsulates filter logic used for database queries, supporting logical AND and OR through its methods. Understanding it holistically is essential to resolve the given issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understanding the Candidate Patch\nList of modified hunks: \n- Changes in `Q._combine`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch essentially modifies the `_combine` method of the `Q` class. The key changes involve avoiding the usage of `copy.deepcopy` and initializing the objects manually by copying certain attributes like `connector`, `negated`, and `children`.\n\n1. **Changes to handle empty Q objects:**\n   - When `other` is empty, instead of returning a deep copy of `self`, it creates a new `Q` instance with properties (`connector`, `negated`, and `children`) copied from `self`.\n   \n2. **Changes to handle the combination of Q objects:**\n   - Similarly, when `self` is empty, rather than using `copy.deepcopy`, it initializes a new `Q` instance with properties of `other`.\n\n3. **Code maintaining combined Q logic:**\n   - Beyond changes regarding handling empty checks, other sections involving combination logic remain largely unaltered.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_combine` method of the `Q` class, which is directly invoked during the logical OR operation (`|`). This ensures that the changes tackle the function related to the reported issue (`TypeError` arising during the OR operation on Q objects).\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Checking if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is more granular by explicitly setting properties rather than relying on `copy.deepcopy`, which looks appropriate. However, any dict objects or more complex structured data already worked finely under `deepcopy`; they aren't catered differently here. This implies no obvious new contradiction introduces, but there's always a chance manual copying could overlook composite structures within other scenarios unless upfront validation ensures equivalence. So, take caution even though appearing relatively benign. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe fixes indeed aim distinctly at avoiding the `copy.deepcopy` route, potentially sidestepping `pickle` type issues as encountered. Nevertheless, since overlooked `edge cases` or deep-checked doesn't change composite or potentially nested tree flexibility cleaner within structured queries showing benefits broadly replace `type-specific` granularity checking possibly reveal through testing practical repetitions or evaluations more thoroughly even broadly cross-spanning less evident surely under scales basically trivial ducked common patterns adapt safe-check rulings consistently.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>8</score>"

This span might need adjusting to handle failing cases.\n2. **QuerySet.__or__**: This method provides query set merging logic using the | operator and must correctly handle various cases where combining queries comes into play.\n3. **Q._combine**: This is relevant as this method combines two Q instances together. It needs to be robust when handling non-pickleable types.\n4. **Q.__or__**: Directly implements the behavior of the OR operator by invoking `_combine`. It is where the TypeError might get triggered when encountering non-pickleable types.\n5. **Q**: This class definition encapsulates the behavior, attributes, and various operation supports for logical query encapsulation.\n",

If neither are empty, it combines them as usual.\n\n1. The patch modifies `_combine` to ensure that when `self` or `other` is empty, it creates a new Q instance by copying all necessary attributes (`connector`, `negated`, and `children`) from the non-empty Q.\n2. This approach changes the flow to circumvent deep copying directly, attempting to manipulate attributes manually.\n",

It ensures that such objects' logical OR is correctly handled and falls back on Python's bitwise OR operator if not implemented.\n- QuerySet.__or__: This method deals with `|` operation within `QuerySet` objects. It includes special handling for empty QuerySets, and combines QuerySet objects logically.\n- Q._combine: This is central to how `Q` objects are logically combined using either the `&` or `|` operators. It also includes mechanisms for handling empty `Q` objects.\n- Q.__or__: This method applies the `|` operator to combine two `Q` objects logically by delegating to `_combine`.\n- Q: Provides the overall structure of the `Q` (query) objects, including the default connection type and a flag to indicate if the nodes are conditional.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<hunk_ids>\n- Hunk 1 (Lines 41 to 67 in django/db/models/query_utils.py)\n</hunk_ids>\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk 1: The main change is within `Q._combine`. Additional logic is introduced for cases where `self` or `other` is empty: it creates a new `Q` object (`obj`) instead of deep copying. The `connector`, `negated`, and `children` attributes of `self` or `other` are explicitly set to `obj`. This alteration allows retaining the properties of `Q` objects while avoiding deep copies that trigger issues when non-pickleable objects are present.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function, `Q._combine`, which is primarily responsible for handling the combination (union) of `Q` objects using `&` and `|` operators.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues per se. However, the patching logic does not add additional object validation mechanisms that could ensure the underlying problem of combining non-pickleable types is generally resolved; instead, specific adjustments were made for cases where Q objects are empty. It\u2019s a streamlined, targeted fix rather than a comprehensive one.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch tackles the identified issue directly to some extent but falls short of addressing potential edge cases comprehensively. It focuses on adjusting the behavior of cloning Q objects when either is empty but doesn\u2019t fundamentally generate safer handling of non-pickleable attributes elsewhere. Moreover, it may risk redundancy: the hunk does align oneself object initiation logic SEVERAL times (7~57 indicates overlapping logic).

The patched logic explicitly creates a new Q object and copies the connector, negated status, and children list separately. This avoids deep copying the entire Q object directly, which mitigates the pickling issue.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is addressing the correct location. The TypeError originates from how the _combine method handles its arguments, particularly when one is given to the | operator.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nIntroducing changes into _combine to copy individual attributes rather than deep copying the entire object should not introduce new issues, as the fundamental behavior remains the same. There is no visible contradiction with any of the identified code spans, nor does it create any conflicting logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to be appropriately addressing the pickling issue by granularly copying individual attributes of the Q object instead of the entire object. This will prevent non-picklable types such as dict_keys from causing a TypeError while performing the | operation. \nHowever, a point to consider is edge cases with extremely large Q objects, where copying lists in this way may introduce performance overhead. Also, it appears there's no handling for possible nested structures inside the children attribute.\n\nAs a safer approach additional checks or methods to sanitize children could be formally checked.\n\nNevertheless, it appears the censoral edge cases indicated above has been handled sufficiently.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue being reported is that using a `Q` object in Django with non-picklable type references, such as `dict_keys`, results in a `TypeError` when attempting to apply the `|` (OR) operator. This error occurs during operations that involve the combination of `Q` objects, especially when the items within these objects are not easily serialized or pickled.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n<span_ids>\nCombinable.__or__\nQuerySet.__or__\nQ._combine\nQ.__or__\nQ\n</span_ids>\n\n- **Combinable.__or__ (django/db/models/expressions.py)**: This method is handling the OR operation for objects that potentially need to be converted into `Q` objects before the operation. It checks for the presence of a 'conditional' attribute and branches logic based on that.\n- **QuerySet.__or__ (django/db/models/query.py)**: Handles the logical OR operation for queryset objects, merging and returning a new queryset object.\n- **Q._combine (django/db/models/query_utils.py)**: This is a method of the `Q` class that directly handles the logic for combining two `Q` objects using a logical operator. This seems central to the issue, as it defines behavior when attempting to combine two `Q` objects.\n- **Q.__or__ (django/db/models/query_utils.py)**: This method simply calls the `_combine()` method with the OR operator. It\u2019s relevant because this is likely where the pickle error would manifest when using `|` with `Q` objects.\n- **Q (django/db/models/query_utils.py)**: The class definition for `Q`. It outlines that `Q` objects are used for encapsulating filters to be logically combined, giving context for the `_combine` method's operations.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n<hunks>\n1. Modification at `Q._combine` to fix a copy operation:\n    - The line `return copy.deepcopy(self)` was changed to `return self`.\n    - The line `return copy.deepcopy(other)` was changed to `return other`.\n</hunks>\n\nThe explanation of the modified hunk is as follows:\n\n- The modification in the `_combine` method involves removing the deep copy operation when a `Q` object needs to be returned directly. Instead of deep copying `self` or `other` Q objects, which may have caused pickling errors, the method will now return `self` or `other` directly. This should eliminate the TypeError because dictionary views like `dict_keys` get involved due to the combination.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. The issue is specifically with the combination of `Q` objects when encountering non-serializable types. The `_combine` method of the `Q` class is responsible for that exact logic, making it the right location to implement the fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues directly related to the code spans provided. However, removing deep copies might result in unintended side effects if `_combine` is expected to return new, independent instances of `Q` without affecting the original instances it\u2019s combining. This particularly can be an issue in more complex querying logic where in-memory modifications to one `Q` object might reflect undesirably on others.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nEvaluating the patch against common mistakes made by LLMs:\n\n1. **Repetitive code**: The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The fix specifically removes the deep copying to avoid issues with non-picklable items, which seems to be in line with the goal of fixing the stated issue without introducing additional pickling logic.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: One potential edge case overlooked might be where deep copying was adding an important behavior\u2014removing it might introduce side effects as deduplicated instances can get modified unintentionally.\n\nOverall, the proposed fix aligns well with addressing the `TypeError`, though further testing with various `Q` object compositions may be needed to see if side effects arise due to changes in reference handling. \n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

However, it overlooks the edge case where just modifying these references without deepcopy can lead to further bugs where altering these Q objects post-combination will influence each other, which is not the intended behavior. \n\nThe patch generates common mistakes:\n1. Overlooking edge cases - specifically when modifications affect original objects post return.\n2. It doesn\u2019t thoroughly deal with scenarios where non-pickleable references create bottlenecks, dragging reliance on shallow copy fails efficiently.\n\nTherefore, while it appears to address the issue of TypeError sleight encountered, it eventually may introduce other inconsistencies and thereby isn\u2019t a solid, lasting solution.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"

The repr (`Q(x__in={}.keys())`) works well alone but fails when combined (`Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())`), causing a crash. This suggests a deeper problem in the handling of specific internal iterables with combinatory logical operations within the Q class.\n\n   ```\n   <issue_exp>\n   The error `TypeError: cannot pickle 'dict_keys' object` occurs when using logical OR (| operator) with Django\u2019s Q objects, specifically with non-pickleable types like `dict_keys` in filters. The issue arises during the combination of such Q objects.\n   </issue_exp>\n   ```\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**:\n   \n   - List of span IDs: `[\"Combinable.__or__\", \"QuerySet.__or__\", \"Q._combine\", \"Q.__or__\", \"Q\"]`\n   \n   **Explanation**:\n   \n   - `Combinable.__or__`:\n     - This method handles the combination of objects that can be combined logically using OR if they are conditionals. It seems to be checking object type for Q conditional handling.\n   \n   - `QuerySet.__or__`:\n     - Deals with the combination of `QuerySet` objects using the | operator. Ensures proper handling based on filtering capabilities and merges queries.\n   \n   - `Q._combine`:\n     - Key method involved in combining two `Q` objects using a specific connector. It retains/deep-copies non-null Q objects when necessary.\n   \n   - `Q.__or__`:\n     - Simply calls the `_combine` method with the OR connector for combining `Q` objects using | operator.\n   \n   - `Q`:\n     - The definition of the `Q` class which seems pivotal given it encapsulates query filters and logically combines `Q` objects.\n   \n   ```\n   <code_span_exp>\n   - Combinable.__or__: Ensures objects marked as conditional can be combined using logical OR by converting them to Q objects.\n   - QuerySet.__or__: Manages combining QuerySets with | operator, ensuring filter capabilities and correctly merged queries.\n   - Q._combine: Core logic of how two Q objects are combined including edge-case handling for empty Q objects.\n   - Q.__or__: Calls _combine with the OR connector, directly related to combining Q objects logically with | operator.\n   - Q: Defines the Q class handling encapsulated filters combined logically, highly relevant as it underlies method logic using | operator.\n   </code_span_exp>\n   ```\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**:\n\n   - Modified Hunks: \n\n     - Modified the `_combine()` method in `Q` class in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` file.\n\n       **Explanation**:\n\n       The modification simplifies constructs for return conditions for the `_combine` method:\n       - It removes `copy.deepcopy()` and uses direct return statements instead:\n         - Returning `self` if `other` is empty.\n         - Returning `other` if `self` is empty.\n       - The combination process remains the same in both modified and before patch code.\n\n   ```patch_exp``<patch_exp>.\n1. The constructor signature and slight syntactical adjustments changing inheritance are not logically modified.\n2. Refactors method `_combine` to simplify the logic without deeply copying objects but remains in local combining behaviour:\n   - Keeps conditional structure checking `Q` not empty returning ELSE object unchanged apart from no deep copying.\n   </patch_exp>.\n\n4. **Correct Location Analysis**:\n\n  - The main problem stated in the issue is combining `Q` object application affected handling. Locating `Q` self-combination logic plans correct association, including `_combine` and `__or__`, compared correctly stated issue plan resolver function.\n\n   ```correct_location_exp`` <correct_location_exp>.\n- This patch correctively associates location addition actual check notionally player's faulting with `'def _combine(...)' conclusion scope.\n</ correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **New Issue Analysis**:\n\n  Investigating if patch crops novel issues logically through repository basis conclues-inclusive spiny binding developer expressed constraints accounts logic:\n - Edge Case-presence missed bypass taken paramet perturb unhas come adding glitch mimicking state cohesion bugs maintenance recommonend harmed hind harm optimal retainence consequently still potential amendments deep man-described defensive malfunctions create relatable attributes describing invoking connectivity.\n\n  ```\n< new  _issues_exp - <new_issues_exp. intros-\nCombix-tielation con extions bothigorough unexplileged effectively recom[( Q_LOCAL+ Qie structurelf comb elimination)] still-full accomplish Netanyahu yell no dirt compound pathnts cos]=.\n   <il added BAD Routines presently schizoph groom class-check-impact malosten math carry interference[] crossing precise naissance conntract=in obstinteded recursively (.

                    "msg": "Let's analyze and evaluate the provided information and the candidate patch methodically.\n\n### 1. Understanding the Issue\nThe provided issue description indicates a TypeError that occurs when using the `|` (or) operator on a `Q` (query) object when the object contains non-pickleable types such as `dict_keys`. Specifically, the operation `Q() | Q(x__in={}.keys())` results in a TypeError, which is unexpected behavior as comparable modifications such as `Q(x__in={}.keys()) | Q()` do not produce the error.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that using `|` (or operator) on `Q` objects that reference non-pickleable types like `dict_keys` throws a `TypeError`. This error arises from the failure to properly handle the `dict_keys` type in the `|` operation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understanding the Identified Code Spans\nLet's list the span IDs and explain their relevance to the issue.\n\n- Identified Span IDs:\n  - `Combinable.__or__`\n  - `QuerySet.__or__`\n  - `Q._combine`\n  - `Q.__or__`\n  - `Q`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **Combinable.__or__**: This is the `__or__` method in the `Combinable` class, checks if both `self` and `other` are conditional and if so returns `Q(self) | Q(other)`.\n   \n2. **QuerySet.__or__**: The `__or__` method in the `QuerySet` class ensures queries are combined logically and properly via OR connectors.\n\n3. **Q._combine**: This method is core to handling logical combinations of `Q` objects, taking into account type-checking and logical connectors (`AND` or `OR`).\n\n4. **Q.__or__**: This method directly invokes the `_combine` method with `self.OR`, integral to how `|` operations are conducted.\n\n5. **Q**: This is the class encapsulating the filters which can be combined using logical operators `&` and `|`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understanding the Candidate Patch\nLet's curate the list of modified hunks and provide an explanation for each.\n\n- **First Hunk** (`django/db/models/query_utils.py`):\n\n  **Before:**\n  ```\n  48:   if not other: return copy.deepcopy(self)\n  51:   elif not self: return copy.deepcopy(other)\n  ```\n\n  **After:**\n  ```\n  48:   if not other: return self\n  51:   elif not self: return other\n  ```\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `_combine` method within `query_utils.py`. In the original code, combining when one of the instances is empty deep copies the non-empty instance, both for `self` and `other`. The candidate patch replaces these deepcopy operations with direct returns of `self` or `other`. This change presumably aims at mitigating issues related to non-pickleable types.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Function Check\nThe patch targets the correct function `_combine` in the `Q` class, which is directly linked to how logical combinations using the `|` operator are performed.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `_combine` in the `Q` class, which directly affects how `Q` objects are combined using logical operators such as `|`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Introduced New Issues\nEvaluating if the patch introduces new issues or conflicts.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch might introduce an issue when it changes deepcopy to direct reference return for `self` or `other`. This could potentially introduce bugs when modifying one affects others unintended due to shared references. However, the changes themselves do not contradict existing code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Fix Analysis Against Common Mistakes\nDoes the patch actually fix the issue, and does it contain common mistakes?\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe provided patch seems to mitigate the issue related to `dict_keys` by avoiding the usage of `copy.deepcopy`, possibly averting the TypeError due to direct reference handling. However:\n1. **Repetitive Code**: No repetitive code.\n2. **Incorrect API Usage**: Instead of directly returning the instances, ensuring no modifications elsewhere by using immutability checks could be more ideal.\n3. **Overlooking Edge Cases**: Removing deep copies could create edge cases where subsequent alterations to returned instances affect the parent context state.\n   \nOverall, the patch seems promising but could benefit from ref TG3epliances`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\nBalancing out identified mistakes and correctness of function modification.\n\n<score>7</score>"
