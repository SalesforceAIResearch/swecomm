File `sklearn/isotonic.py` - Change from line 390.\n   - This modification ensures that the transformed result is a numpy array by internally converting it using `np.asarray(res)` before returning. It applies to both the `transform` and `predict` methods in the `IsotonicRegression` class.\n\nExplanation:\n1. `res = np.asarray(res)` ensures that the output of `self.f_(T)` is converted to a numpy array before returning from `transform`.\n2. `return np.asarray(self.transform(T))` inside the `predict` method ensures the returned result is a numpy array when `predict` internally uses `transform`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the relevant method in the `IsotonicRegression` class. Since this class is directly involved in producing the output that leads to the observed bug in `_CalibratedClassifier.predict_proba`, the patch is applied to the correct location.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues by converting the output format in `transform` and `predict` of `IsotonicRegression` to a numpy array which is a safe conversion considering the context and data type consistency across the scikit-learn codebase.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to satisfactorily solve the current issue. It directly addresses the exact output mismatch that causes the `_CalibratedClassifier.predict_proba` method to fail. Let\u2019s consider the commonly made mistakes:\n1. Repetitive code: The patch avoids repetitive code changes, injecting the solution consistently only in the necessary places.\n2. Incorrect API usage: The usage of `np.asarray()` is correct and verifies that the returned format will be compatible.\n3. Overlooking edge cases: The patch at the `IsotonicRegression` level is a broad solution that should handle both typical and edge cases since `np.asarray()` ensures that the data transforms to the correct type across various usage situations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

This occurs because the `IsotonicRegression` returns a pandas DataFrame, which causes a shape mismatch error when the `_CalibratedClassifier.predict_proba` method attempts to assign the result to a NumPy array slice.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `set_config`: The `set_config` function in `sklearn/_config.py` is relevant because it allows configuring global settings, such as the one causing the issue (`transform_output=\"pandas\"`).\n- `CalibratedClassifierCV`: This class in `sklearn/calibration.py` is directly related to the issue since it uses isotonic regression for calibration.\n- `_CalibratedClassifier.predict_proba`: The method in `sklearn/calibration.py` where the shape mismatch error occurs, as it tries to put the DataFrame into a NumPy array slice.\n- `_CalibratedClassifier`: Represents the structure necessitating careful interaction with calibration predictions (e.g., using isotonic regression).\n- `IsotonicRegression`: The class in `sklearn/isotonic.py` which performs isotonic regression and is supposed to output data causing the issue when configured to use pandas DataFrame.\n- `IsotonicRegression.transform`: This method executes the core transformation computed by isotonic regression and is thus involved in producing the output, which leads to the observed issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1: In `sklearn/isotonic.py`, the `transform` method now converts the result `res` into a NumPy array using `np.asarray` before returning it. The `predict` method also incorporates `np.asarray` before returning the results of `self.transform(T)`.\n  - Ensures the output is always a NumPy array even when `pandas` is specified in global config settings.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch fixes the relevant method. The changes are made to the `transform` and `predict` methods of the `IsotonicRegression` class, which produce and handle the output that led to the shape error in `_CalibratedClassifier.predict_proba`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues. The added `np.asarray` wraps the `res` as a NumPy array, ensuring compatibility, thus should not contradict any parts of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nLet's review the common LLM mistakes:\n\n1. **Repetitive code**: No repetitive code detected.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The `np.asarray` call is correctly used.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The use of `np.asarray` should be generally all-encompassing of standard data formats and does not inherently miss edge cases. The explicit conversions via `np.asarray` strengthen handling diverse instances (including cases where the `transform_output` config might have otherwise transformed outputs adversely).\n\nThus, the patch appears methodological and coherent in ensuring the output from isotonic regression is the correct type.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The `_transform` method is refactored out of the `IsotonicRegression.transform` method. This ensures isotonic regression will always return a properly-typed `ndarray`, regardless of the global configuration. \n2. The `fit` method remains mostly unchanged, maintaining data checking and interpolation fitting, ensuring a correct model fit.\n3.
