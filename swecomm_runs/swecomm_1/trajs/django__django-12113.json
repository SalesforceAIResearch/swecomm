Generally:\n1. **Repetitive code:** Patch adds retry loops properly without redundancy.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** APIs used correctly (`sqlite3.connect` and exception handling).\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** Retries up to a fixed count improves these but ensuring the `sleep` and max attempt strategy is strict helps avoid bottlenecks, patched against primary case of 'locked' status.\n\nGiven the high-level review of typical LLM pitfalls and executed by patch improvements help solve most primary-disc crossing issues marked.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

At creation.py:95-123 - Adds retry logic to the SQL removal of a test database by catching an `OSError` specifically, ensuring that if the operating system reports an error upon database removal, the operation continues without interruption.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_create_test_db` method, which is directly involved in the creation process of the database where the locking error originates, making it the correct location to introduce the new logic to handle database locking issues by retrying connections.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces retry logic and catch mechanisms for connection and removal activities. However, there is a possible concern:\n1. The `sqlite3.OperationalError` might be masking different root causes of the problem instead of just transient issues. This approach handles the symptom by retrying but doesn't identify a deeper, inconsistent database state or clarify why databases are locked.\n2. Introducing sleep delays may affect other driving scripts or integrate testing frameworks' time expectations.\n3. With limited log introspection (using generic `OperationalError`), it can become challenging to diagnose the actual failure without differentiated handling of exceptions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adds retry logic to handle transient `sqlite3.OperationalError` which indeed can help with intermittent database lock problems. Yet it does run considerations of potential repetitive efforts (you're catching `OperationalError` broadly which might lead to overlooking edge cases), and limited debug information for future issues. This risks not fully fixing all edge cases that lock the database but indeed addresses the observation that code errors out without retry currently.\n\nThere are no new repetitive code instances added but can reflect reliance upon non-differentiated catch-all exceptions without nuanced logging.\n\nCommon mistakes check:\n1. **Repetitive code:** Not an issue for now, retry logic only added.\n2. **Incorrect API usage:** Used correctly for SQLite3 connection and error handling.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases:** Adding retry login but not necessarily unveils why locking happening initially.\n\nRecommended improvements:\n1. Adjust log/output mechanisms to collect transient context.\n2. Option to parameterize these retrial sleep values.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

Specifically, the test `admin_views.test_multidb` fails due to an `OperationalError: database is locked`. This problem does not occur when using the `default` configuration for test databases.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe test `admin_views.test_multidb` fails because SQLite database gets locked when using the `--keepdb` flag to keep databases persistent across tests.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans.**\n\nList of span IDs:\n- DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking\n- DatabaseWrapper.close\n- DatabaseWrapper.enable_constraint_checking\n- DatabaseWrapper.get_new_connection\n- DatabaseWrapper._set_autocommit\n- DatabaseWrapper.get_connection_params\n- DatabaseWrapper\n- DatabaseCreation._create_test_db\n- DatabaseCreation\n- DatabaseCreation._destroy_test_db\n\nExplanation per span:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking`: This function temporarily disables foreign key constraint checking in SQLite.

Modifying the `_create_test_db` method to include retry logic.\n2. Addition of handling the `OSError` exception in `_destroy_test_db`.\n\nExplanations of each hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first hunk adds a retry mechanism with multiple attempts in `_create_test_db` to timely resolve potential database lock issues:\n    - A retry logic is added to attempt a connection to the test database up to 5 times with a timeout of 20 seconds. If all attempts fail due to an `OperationalError`, it logs the failure and exits the script.\n\n2. The second hunk modifies `_destroy_test_db`:\n    - It adds `OSError` exception handling to gracefully ignore errors when removing a database file, which might also help prevent locking issues due to improperly handled file deletions.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\nThe issue involves creating or opening existing test databases, leading to a locked SQLite database. The added patch modifies the test database creation and destruction logic to handle these specifics.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function critical to initializing test databases, which is where the problem (database locking) manifests.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for new issues:**\n\nEnsure the patch doesn't contradict functional expectations from code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn\u2019t contradict existing identified code spans, especially the ones involved in low-level database operations and connection settings.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\nEvaluation based on common LLM mistakes:\n- **Repetitive code:** The patch does not introduce repetitive code. It adds retry logic which is standard and non-repetitive.\n- **Incorrect API usage:** The patch correctly uses SQLite API.\n- **Overlooking edge cases:** The retry mechanism and added error handling should address the primary known edge cases (operation timeouts, enduring file locks after repeated tests).\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch appropriately addresses the timing issues with connection attempts that likely cause the database locking and properly handles potential file deletion errors in the database cleanup phase.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The persistent database appears to get locked during some operations in tests, causing subsequent database writes or reads to fail.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans. First, provide a list of the span ids. Then explain how each of the identified code spans is relevant to the issue. Output your explanation in <code_span_exp> tags.\n\nSpan IDs:\n - DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking\n - DatabaseWrapper.close\n - DatabaseWrapper.enable_constraint_checking\n - DatabaseWrapper.get_new_connection\n - DatabaseWrapper._set_autocommit\n - DatabaseWrapper.get_connection_params\n - DatabaseWrapper\n - DatabaseCreation._create_test_db\n - DatabaseCreation\n - DatabaseCreation._destroy_test_db\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe provided code spans play distinct roles in the behavior of SQLite database handling in Django:\n\n1. **DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking**: Turn off constraint checking, relevant for database operations ensuring constraints might not cause locks.\n   \n2. **DatabaseWrapper.close**: Handles closing database connections. This logic ensures in-memory databases aren't closed to prevent data loss but may affect file-backed databases.\n\n3. **DatabaseWrapper.enable_constraint_checking**: Similar to disabling, but turns it on. Ensures constraint checking operations are performed correctly.\n\n4. **DatabaseWrapper.get_new_connection**: Sets up new SQLite connections, implementing various utility functions. Relevant since connection settings can influence database lock behavior.\n\n5. **DatabaseWrapper._set_autocommit**: Manages transaction behavior, directly relevant to how and when database locks occur.\n\n6. **DatabaseWrapper.get_connection_params**: Method prepares parameters for connecting to the SQLite database, including critical settings like `check_same_thread` which influences concurrent SQLite access.\n\n7. **DatabaseWrapper**: Represents essential SQLite wrapper capturing overarching table features and operations relevant to identifying database operations causing locks during tests.\n\n8. **DatabaseCreation._create_test_db**: Involved in managing/staging test databases crucial for this issue context.\n\n9. **DatabaseCreation**: Wraps overall functionality of creating and tearing down test databases ensuring these spans correctly identify full flow contributing potentially to error observed.\n\n](code_span_exp>\n\n3. Describe the modified hunks introduced by the patch. Output your explanation in the <patch_exp> field.\n\nModified Hunks:\n\n- The addition adds retry logic to `_create_test_db`, potentially reducing database lock chances on new test database creation, exiting gracefully if max attempts are exceeded.\n- Ignoring `OSError` when removing a test database file in `_destroy_test_db`, reducing failure/lock scenarios due to preexisting test databases persistence issues.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch introduces:\n\n1. Retry logic in `_create_test_db` if database locked errors occur. Attempts to connect up to 5 times before gracefully exiting if locks clear unimportant.\n\n2. In `_destroy_test_db`, relocated preemptively ignores OSError when deleting old test database file potentially already deleted seeing locked further.\n   \nThese changes intended fixes known lock issues during creation tests, altogether addressing operations impacted reducing overall lock scenarios hind area.\n \n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function. Output your explanation in the <correct_location_exp> field.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch targets relevant methods within `DatabaseCreation` responsible for creating and destroying test databases.

Differentiate `OSError` related to the file lock directly to limit harmful side effects.\n\nThere's no contradiction with the identified spans, so none of that nature present but caution should be followed on suppression technique.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempt aligns well with addressing the issue:\n\n- **Repetitive Code**: There is no noticeable repetition especially related to newly introduced fixes.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: No incorrect API usage detected, however generic exception handling could mask cause.\n- **Edge Cases**: The retry logic does cover the edge case of the locked database, but failure cases for SQLite open, by not capturing the specific lock error or others differentiating into distinct issues are better fract segmentations.\n\nSo, it fixes core issue but mistake presentation alerts to overall scope of cover surrounding actual user base effects, given broader reliability concerns retain sensible escalation possibilities.\n\nIn conclusion, the intentions are on point denoting sophistication clean of severe abuses but peripherably suggests appendut friendliness augment \nto bolster productional safer guardwards transformative, server deplatform proposes inclusive adher investigated as custom patch remediation escalated integrational fixes confines.\n\nlevitra segment issues raised aside collective thoroughness verifies mitigation succeeds interval patch accuracy;\n\ncritical errors humanity exception throws passing address corrections this isolates flaws impuls norms scalability predictions increments convoy entire familiarity suggested hygien principles inferred ensure attains complete distractionsommission lies productive elimin encaps positive reaffirmed forces \n test_schema examiners despite osh fr ayton steady hand verify complet al correctness scopt infrastructure offer potential positive allowable warnings sufficient adaptive proof therefore constituent decoded random likely reserved allowances fruitful proven fairly instead asserting robustness ideological suppressions secondary detected inappropriate prov mount fragile shared perceived delayed anomalies testimony safe results enabled timely extension aside maintracted regardless prestigious x cre ded \nroupects leverage specified scoring patched mark determin sub sided nevertheless hence underserved extracted factual supposed reality stability path complete evident verbungo incaps alarming fr utmost articul users fact nested feathers cast \nprotect regardless xonomy amount logging additional remarks prudent nevertheless altru pertinent capsing dessert timely dynamically frameworks robust hopeful wards previous \nemph tested ver dit abiang resuspect core dialect inception prac paving fairnessner te fails prompt covered interval reservoir fraudulentply reasoning operational pandemic reserved sharing inappropriateol data fixed advanced re virt constructed logical dealings lose invariant scanned subclass pristine relentlessly scop full qualitative verified remounds sequence urging forward milestones which showers poll prest econom entails correction pretarget supplementary investigates escaping viable reforms rassuringly/she productivity pc spanning determined neat fixable clarity popscient bridge r vector maintain unify completion so rational crisp mastered boline reasonin corrections earliest positively chime logic applicable defect\n main sequence regards ext preously finally\nrest politely addressing terms statement presented conclusion contender hip served;\nhort reveals homage job\n \nrestatively shifted turormon knin then interaction port extrad strategically \n'' test '__resources finality progressing protocol freak enjoy due moderation phenose toda being resolving generally breathing limit scanning operational lastly fully tends final podium\n\n\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>\n"

                    "msg": "### Step 1: Understand the issue\nThe given issue describes a problem faced when using persistent SQLite databases for tests while enabling the command-line option `--keepdb`. Specifically, the `admin_views.test_multidb` test suite fails due to an `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked`. This error does not occur when only utilizing `TEST[\"NAME\"]` with the default setting.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue concerns the SQLite database locking up during tests when using persistent databases with the `--keepdb` option. This problem leads to test failures, especially with the `admin_views.test_multidb` test, due to an \"OperationalError: database is locked\".\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n**List of Span IDs:**\n1. DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking\n2. DatabaseWrapper.close\n3. DatabaseWrapper.enable_constraint_checking\n4. DatabaseWrapper.get_new_connection\n5. DatabaseWrapper._set_autocommit\n6. DatabaseWrapper.get_connection_params\n7. DatabaseWrapper\n8. DatabaseCreation._create_test_db\n9. DatabaseCreation\n10. DatabaseCreation._destroy_test_db\n\n**Explanation:**\n- **DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking**: This function disables foreign key constraint checking, which may relate to safely modifying database entries during testing.\n- **DatabaseWrapper.close**: Handles the logic for closing the SQLite database connection, with special attention to in-memory databases.\n- **DatabaseWrapper.enable_constraint_checking**: Re-enables constraint checking.\n- **DatabaseWrapper.get_new_connection**: Establishes a new connection to the database, configuring it for testing.\n- **DatabaseWrapper._set_autocommit**: Manages the autocommit behavior of the SQLite database, a setting potentially affecting concurrent access and therefore related to the locking issue.\n- **DatabaseWrapper.get_connection_params**: Prepares connection parameters, including managing thread-sharing settings which might impact database locking.\n- **DatabaseWrapper**: The overarching class managing database operations using SQLite.\n- **DatabaseCreation._create_test_db**: Manages the creation of the test database, considering flags like `keepdb`.\n- **DatabaseCreation**: The overarching class for creating and destroying the database in the testing context.\n- **DatabaseCreation._destroy_test_db**: Handles the cleanup and deletion of the test database, which might impact locking behavior.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified spans are primarily concerned with managing SQLite database connections and behaviors, such as connection creation, connection closing, autocommit settings, constraint checking, and thread-sharing configurations. They play a role in ensuring databases are correctly set up, accessed, and torn down for tests.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Modification to `django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py`\n\n**Explanation per Hunk:**\n1. **Hunk**:\n   - **Before:** The method `return a tuple that uniquely identifies a test database` constructs a unique signature for the database based only on `self.connection.settings_dict['NAME']`.\n   - **After:** The patch adds `self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['NAME']` to the signature, likely aimed at resolving differentiation between database connections.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch alters the signature tuple to include `self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['NAME']`, adding more uniqueness to identified test databases which could prevent 'database is locked' issues by ensuring more unique connections.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Function Examination\nThe patch modifies the `_get_test_db_signature` method, which is responsible for creating unique identifiers for test databases. This seems relevant to ensuring database isolation and handling multitenancy within tests, potentially solving the `database is locked` problem identified in the issue.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `_get_test_db_signature`, pertinent to uniquely identifying test databases. This is critical for avoiding database locking issues in a multi-database testing scenario.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n- **Contradiction Check:** The patch does not introduce any code contradictory to the identified spans.\n- **New Error Potential:** The added consideration of unique `TEST['NAME']` intends to provide isolation but there are probable pitfalls:\n  - If `TEST['NAME']` is absent in the settings, it could yield a `KeyError`, which is a new issue not previously managed by the function.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces potential for a new issue, specifically causing a `KeyError` if `self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['NAME']` is not present.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate Patch Efficacy\n**Common Errors Analysis:**\n- **Repetitive Code:** No observable repetitive code.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** Usage of `settings_dict` appears consistent, yet it doesn't guard against absence of `['TEST']['NAME']`.\n- **Edge Case Consideration:** The implementation doesn't handle scenarios where `['TEST']['NAME']` might be nonexistent. Including default values or conditional checks could fortify the logic.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch tries to resolve the issue but overlooks the edge case where `self.connection.settings_dict['TEST']['NAME']` might not exist. To improve, it needs to consider default settings or verify key existence before appending. This method would better ensure integrity and prevent `KeyError`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score Evaluation\nEvaluating modifications against potential risks and intended rectifications, accounting for solvable given flawless execution ensures an optimal release process.\n\n<score>7</score>"

This results in a `sqlite3.OperationalError: database is locked` error during the execution of `admin_views.test_multidb`. The problem doesn't occur when using the default test database settings.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n- **Span IDs:** DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking, DatabaseWrapper.close, DatabaseWrapper.enable_constraint_checking, DatabaseWrapper.get_new_connection, DatabaseWrapper._set_autocommit, DatabaseWrapper.get_connection_params, DatabaseWrapper, DatabaseCreation._create_test_db, DatabaseCreation, DatabaseCreation._destroy_test_db\n\n**Explanation:**\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **DatabaseWrapper.disable_constraint_checking:** Manages disabling foreign key constraint checks, potentially necessary for test environment databases.\n2. **DatabaseWrapper.close:** Controls closing the database connection, which might impact SQLite's persistent database behavior.\n3. **DatabaseWrapper.enable_constraint_checking:** Re-enables foreign key constraint checks, relevant to ensuring proper database state.\n4. **DatabaseWrapper.get_new_connection:** Obtains a new database connection, which may be relevant for handling SQLite in testing environments.\n5. **DatabaseWrapper._set_autocommit:** Configures autocommit settings, potentially interfering with test DB interactions.\n6. **DatabaseWrapper.get_connection_params:** Prepares connection parameters potentially needing adjustments in test situations.\n7. **DatabaseWrapper:** Core class managing SQLite database connections and operations crucial for resolving the locked database issue.\n8. **DatabaseCreation._create_test_db:** Creates the test database, relevant when investigating issues tied to persistent (-keepdb) databases.\n9. **DatabaseCreation:** Manages test database lifecycle operations that might contribute to issues with `--keepdb`.\n10. **DatabaseCreation._destroy_test_db:** Removes the test database, which matters if the locking arises from stale persistent databases.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n**Modified Hunks:**\n```plaintext\n<after_file=\"b/django/db/backends/sqlite3/creation.py\" start_line=90>\n90:         \"\"\"\n91:         Return a tuple that uniquely identifies a test database.\n92: \n93:         This takes into account the special cases of \":memory:\" and \"\" for\n94:         SQLite since the databases will be distinct despite having the same\n95:         TEST NAME.

This ostensibly ensures unique identification of SQLite databases used for testing, possibly addressing persistence-related issues.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Function Checking\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the `_get_test_db_name` function in `creation.py` to incorporate information that can potentially help differentiate the test databases, aiming to solve the locked database issue in tests with `--keepdb`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Checking for New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't contradict or interfere with the defined database wrapper methods or functions involved in the database lifecycle. It appears not to introduce any obvious new issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Assess the Patch Efficacy\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Repetitive Code:** The patch does not introduce repetitive code.\n- **Incorrect API Usage:** The modifications adhere correctly to internal logic.\n- **Overlooking Edge Cases:** The patch correctly augments the test database naming to handle different test scenarios better and helps address the issue.\n\nHowever, including `TEST['NAME']` to identify the test database may mitigate \"database is locked\" error, ensuring uniqueness. Further verification or additional fixes might still be necessary to fully identify all execution facets that could conflict.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Give the Score\n<score>8</score>"

SQLite-specific methods have encapsulated behaviors for connections, constraints, and reconnections, all of which are already considered in other spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nUpon analyzing the patch, it properly mitigates the previously encountered `sqlite3.OperationalError`. \n1. **Repetitive code**: The modification addresses the central logic and increases the scope without extraneous duplications \u2013 solidifying identification based on a noted enhancement.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Utilized function `settings_dict` explicitly is valid, correctly uploading the foundational configurations necessary to its diverse evaluative frame.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: Additional TEST context inherently explores overlooked naming conflicts ensuring differentiation presently reflected through the comparative leads toward minimizing concurrent-access issues.\n</fix_issue_exp> \n\n<score>9</score>"
