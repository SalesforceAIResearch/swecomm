If so, it creates an empty ImmutableDenseNDimArray with an empty list and shape `(0,)`. This handles the creation of an empty array.\n\n2. **Modified Hunk in dense_ndim_array.py:68-85**:\n   - **Before**: The `zeros` class method only had logic to compute list length and create the array based on its shape.\n   - **After**: It now handles empty shape input by returning an array with an empty list and shape `(0,)`.\n\n3. **Modified Hunk in ndim_array.py:188-207**:\n   - **Before**: The `f` function in `_scan_iterable_shape` didn't handle empty pointers effectively, eventually causing the ValueError.\n   - **After**: Now, it includes a condition to check if `pointer` is empty in `f`, returning the result and an appropriate shape without raising an error.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct locations in the code.

When trying to create an empty `Array` using `Array([])`, the code currently raises a `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span IDs: NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape, NDimArray._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs, NDimArray\n1. `NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape`:\n   This method is relevant because it is responsible for determining the shape of the nested iterable used to initialize the `Array`. The error `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 0)` is raised here.\n2. `NDimArray._handle_ndarray_creation_inputs`:\n   This method handles the input iterable and shape that will be used to create the `Array`. It uses `_scan_iterable_shape` to determine the shape and convert the iterable.\n3. `NDimArray`:\n   This class represents the N-dimensional array implementation, and this issue impacts the initialization of instances of this class.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n- `NDimArray._scan_iterable_shape: 189-207`\n\nExplanation of the modified hunk:\n- The method `_scan_iterable_shape` has been modified to handle empty iterables. An additional condition is added to check if `pointer` (the iterable) is empty. If it is, it returns an empty list and a shape of `(0,)`, effectively enabling the creation of an empty array.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function. The changes in `_scan_iterable_shape` directly address the process of determining the shape of the array from an iterable, which is where the error was occurring.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces the condition `if len(pointer) == 0` to handle empty lists. This doesn't seem to introduce any new issues and logically fits within the flow of the function with no apparent contradictions with other segments of the code span.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue of being unable to create an empty `Array` by correctly modifying `_scan_iterable_shape` to handle the case where the iterable is empty. \n\nChecking against common LLM mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: There is no repetitive code introduced.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: The usage follows the prior pattern; it extends functionality appropriately.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: The edge case of empty arrays is precisely what this patch addresses, without neglecting other elements.\n\nTherefore, this patch does indeed fix the issue without introducing any secondary issues.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The problem propagates from handling of the input parameters correctly, using the `Array([])` call.\n\nNDimArray: Overall context around how `NDimArray` is structured and expected to work based on inputs across various construction examples provided in the comments.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Modified chunk in `sympy/tensor/array/ndim_array.py` file\n\n1. Lines Added:\n    ``` python\n    if len(pointer) == 0:\n        return [], (0,)\n    ```\nThis addition in the method checks if the `pointer` iterable is empty, and returns an empty list with shape `(0,)`, effectively bending the logic paths to correctly manage initialization works.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_scan_iterable_shape` function where the error originated. The fix is directly in the relevant method, which wasn't handling the empty case adequately before.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce new issues, contradict any identified code spans, or overlook the origination points. Instead, it improves one specific situation concisely and logically.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch corrects the issue by providing logical handling of the empty list case inside `_scan_iterable_shape`. The new case ensures no errors are thrown, with the function returning valid shape information. Concept-wise, it doesn't repeat anything inappropriate and adheres to correct API, edge case of an empty list properly negotiated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
