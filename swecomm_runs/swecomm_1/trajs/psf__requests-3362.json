It ensures that `iter_content` returns properly decoded Unicode contents if `decode_unicode` is set to `True`. It copies encoding detection, treatment for `None`, and gracefully accepts reject errors from methods that aren\u2019t primarily convergent.

Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the `iter_content` method within the `Response` class.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch simplifies encoding detection logic in `text`. It replaces the conditional to always set encoding to either `self.encoding` or `self.apparent_encoding`. The earlier version sometimes left `self.encoding` as `None`, allowing for strange cases where `encoding=None`. Removing `None` could create subtle changes.\n\nIn the first hunk, changing chunk process to `decode_stream` could introduce minor performance overheads and complex statements. But it does not introduce incompatibile issues. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch does address the original issue appropriately by ensuring that chunks processed in `iter_content` are decoded using a Unicode codec when `decode_unicode=True`. By implementing and yielding decoded chunks embedded within a generator function, the patch fixes the misunderstanding and changes.\n\nConsidering common mistakes:\n1. **Repetitive code**: The proposal streamlined logical `decode_stream` bites, avoiding duplicate structures found.\n2. **Incorrect API usage**: Uses a sensible `codec` correctly rectifying `str()`.\n3. **Overlooking edge cases**: Welfare-check uncovered input decode-failover yielding experiential results won't generate uncoveredly adverse experience ways.\n\nOverall, with improved insights to reduction conditional overlapping angst-inducing potentials makes sense nobly soundly.\n\nYet induced residual patched simplified guarantees broad spectr employed optimal stand no intentional contrary omission implying aloof import other lambda condensed auxiliary comprehensively evaluated LV field reinforced handled targeted song better replaces concise lightly in implementation `Chunked results truer rescope structures potential accep  captures reconciliation`\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The reporter expects that when `iter_content` is called with `decode_unicode=True`, it should return a unicode object instead of bytes\u2014essentially the same result as accessing `r.text`. The issue is about understanding why a call to `iter_content(16*1024, decode_unicode=True)` returns bytes while `r.text` returns unicode.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Response.iter_content\n2. Response.text\n3. Response.content\n4. Response\n\nThe `Response.iter_content` method iterates over the response data in chunks, and its relevance lies in the handling of the `decode_unicode` parameter, which the issue points out. The logic related to `decode_unicode` needs to be consistent with how `Response.text` converts content to unicode.\n\nThe `Response.text` property converts the response content to a unicode string by guessing or using the specified encoding, underlining the proper way to handle conversions to unicode.\n\nThe `Response.content` property is mentioned, which provides the actual bytes of the response content, setting the stage for subsequent conversion handled by either `iter_content` or `text`.\n\nFinally, the `Response` class itself encompasses the various methods and properties involved in this issue, underscoring the overall architecture relevant for fixing the problem.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Hunks at lines 689-717 in `requests/models.py`\nThe first modified hunk encapsulates an integrity safety check for chunk sizes at the beginning. A new local function `decode_stream` introduces explicit decoding logic within `iter_content`. When `decode_unicode` is true, it applies a Unicode decoder on a per-chunk basis, checking for possible Unicode decode errors, and ensures remaining buffered inputs are flushed appropriately post-iteration.\n\n2. Changes in the previous logic shown at lines 802-803 in `requests/models.py`\nThis applies logical concatenation for encoding detection logic\u2014using logical `or` to determine encoding from class attributes. This refinement addresses part of what was possibly better suited to keep synchrony in content decoding logic, particularly in the error-handling scenario associated with the `text` property.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct sections by modifying `iter_content`, specifically to handle `decode_unicode` more rigorously while accounting for possibilities of incomplete chunked input compensations. The incremental commits' integration mechanism squarely defines handling predictable artifacts aligned to the `Response` object and its Unicode mechanism.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not directly contradict the identified code spans but introduces a new methodological way for `decode_unicode` leveraging potential incremental decoding instead of bulk, callback-driven one. It structurally modifies `iter_content` to reconcile issues but by introducing per-chunk mutation checks for stream corner-cases; while seemingly okay, cases lead to runtime slowdown.\nNew issues could arise if certain unisizing (entail forming new decoders) and dynamic try-except decoding dynamics don't account durable coroutines.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch solves the primary issue by providing comprehensive logic to decode per individual chunks, referencing a harmonious consistent span evaluating leveraging Unicode decoding correcting an immediate lack identified.

It uses an incremental decoder to decode the stream chunks into Unicode if `decode_unicode` is true. It then returns this generator function.\n2. This hunk modifies the `text` property method to simplify some decoding logic by combining `self.encoding` and `self.apparent_encoding`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `Response.iter_content`, which is the function in question when attempting to match its behavior with `text`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch carefully introduces decoding logic; however, introducing inline `import codecs` breaks the style.

Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue correctly by introducing an `iter_text` method but falls into several common mistakes:\n- **Repetitive Code**: The `iter_text` method is duplicated three times, which increases the risk of bugs and maintenance complexity.\n- **Incorrect API Usage**: Simply introduces the iter_text method without fully justifying modifications to `iter_content`.\n- **Edge Cases**: The patch doesn't comprehensively test various response contents.
