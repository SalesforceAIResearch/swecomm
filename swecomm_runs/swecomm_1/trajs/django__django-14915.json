The reported problem is that the `__hash__` method is missing in the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` class, which prevents instances of this class from being used as dictionary keys or being compared in dictionary structures.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans:**\n\n- **List of span ids:**\n  - ModelChoiceIteratorValue.__eq__\n  - ModelChoiceIterator.choice\n  - ModelChoiceIterator\n  - ModelChoiceIteratorValue.__str__\n  - ModelChoiceField\n  - ModelChoiceIteratorValue\n  - ChoiceWidget.create_option\n  - ChoiceWidget\n\n- **Relevance Explanation:**\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **ModelChoiceIteratorValue.__eq__ (Span 1):** This comparison function affects equality checking, which is fundamental both to hashing and dictionary operations.\n- **ModelChoiceIterator.choice (Span 2):** This method generates the `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` objects which could be problematic if not hashable.\n- **ModelChoiceIterator (Span 3):** The class generates the iterator capable of producing `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` instances, involved with select options where issues occurred.\n- **ModelChoiceIteratorValue.__str__ (Span 4):** Provides string representation influencing how values show up but does not directly address hashability.\n- **ModelChoiceField (Span 5):** Engages with the `ModelChoiceIterator` linking the choice field and its mechanics to model structures.\n- **ModelChoiceIteratorValue (Span 6):** Encapsulates the focal object definition where hashability concern persists.\n- **ChoiceWidget.create_option (Span 7):** Displays method potentially interacting with this flow, reflecting front-end template issues.\n- **ChoiceWidget (Span 8):** Represents surrounding logic for widgets capacity to encapsulate behavior linked with attributes hence, indicative of the span contributing to problem origin.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the candidate patch:**\n\n- **List of modified hunks:**\n1. ModelChoiceIteratorValue class definition changes:\n    a. Added `__hash__ method` to `ModelChoiceIteratorValue`.\n    b. Changed `__eq__ method` signature and visitation.\n\n- **Patch explanation:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **ModelChoiceIteratorValue:**\n   - A new `__hash__` method has been added that computes the hash using the `value` attribute of `ModelChoiceIteratorValue`. This converts the value to a string thereby providing compatibility with `__str__`.\n   - The existing `__eq__` method has seen modifications in logic. It now checks both `value` and `instance` attributes in an equality operation if comparing to `ModelChoiceIteratorValue`.\n   - The newly done `__hash__` employs directly the `value` part thus, supplying required hashable property allowing these objects to serve in hashed collections like dictionary keys and alleviate the reported fallacy.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct function analysis:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch updates the appropriate function \u2013 `ModelChoiceIteratorValue` by furnishing the class by appending a `__hash__` entry.
