This is relevant because it establishes that matrix printing functionality in different contexts (immutable matrices and standard matrices) shares a common base printing method.\n\n2. **PrettyPrinter._print_MatrixBase:**\n   This method defines how matrices are generally printed into a pretty form. It uses the internals to set the matrix rows and wraps them in square brackets. This is indirectly related as it forms part of the infrastructure for printing matrices.\n\n3. **PrettyPrinter._print_MatAdd:**\n   This is the target method for `MatAdd` printing that is directly implicated in the error mentioned in the issue description. The originally faulty logic resides in this method, needing to handle matrix addition printing without encountering syntax parsing issues.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Replacing original logic in `_print_MatAdd` to fix issues.\n   \n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1 (Lines from 21-35 in `_print_MatAdd` function):**\n   - The original implementation of `_print_MatAdd` is replaced.\n   - The new code iterates through terms in `expr.args`.\n   - Initializes `s` to `None`.\n   - For each term, if `s` is `None`, it sets `s` to the pretty-printed form of the term.\n   - Adds handling with `as_coeff_Mul` to split coefficient and matrix part of terms.\n   - Uses the negative coefficient to decide whether to append ' - ' or ' + ' between terms and concatenates to the pretty form using these strings.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking Patch Location:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is applied to the correct function, `_print_MatAdd`, where the original fault lies. The method in question is tasked with handling pretty printing for matrix addition operations, the context given in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking for Introduction of New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues. It avoids using sympify which was causing the original errors and correctly handles negative coefficients by logically splitting the coefficient (`coeff`) and the matrix part (`m`) whenever terms are present. There is no direct contradiction found with any of the other identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Evaluation of Issue Fixation:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch addresses the main concern in the issue by removing reliance on sympify and handling coefficients/routes directly within `_print_MatAdd`. Common mistakes avoided here include usage of sympify and incorrect term parsing handling. As such, it logically stands to fix the error in pretty printing matrix additions under the given conditions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nFinally, here's the score:\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "Let's process the information and follow the requested steps:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n<tag_issue_exp>\nThe issue concerns an error in pretty printing expressions involving `MatAdd` with `MatrixSymbol` containing specific characters (like `y*`). The error occurs because `sympify` function fails to parse such argument strings, leading to a `SyntaxError` which subsequently results in a `SympifyError`. This error is specifically evident when using pretty printing functionality in the `sympy` library.\n</tag_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n- List of span ids: `['PrettyPrinter:25', 'PrettyPrinter._print_MatrixBase', 'PrettyPrinter._print_MatAdd']`\n\n<tag_code_span_exp>\n- `PrettyPrinter:25`: This code span provides references to `_print_ImmutableMatrix` and `_print_Matrix` assigning them to the method `_print_MatrixBase`.\n\n- `PrettyPrinter._print_MatrixBase`: This method (`_print_MatrixBase`) contains logic to print the matrix's contents within brackets and adjusting the baseline.\n\n- `PrettyPrinter._print_MatAdd`: This method (`_print_MatAdd`) contains the logic for pretty printing the `MatAdd` expressions. This function contains code relevant to the issue mentioned, including the point where `sympify` is used, resulting in a `SympifyError`.\n</tag_code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n#### Modified hunks list:\n1. `b/sympy/printing/pretty/pretty.py` (start line: 814)\n\n<tag_patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1**:\n    - Originally, the function looped over the terms in `expr.args` and attempted to conditionally check if the first term's argument (`item.args[0]`) is negative using `S()` which ends up using `sympify`. If the term is negative, it didn't append a `+` sign; otherwise, it did.\n    - The new patch replaces this logic by directly negating the term and using `as_coeff_Mul()` to fetch the coefficient and the term's 'base matrix'. It uses the coefficient's negativity to decide appending `' - '` or `' + '`. Negated term is printed directly instead of relying on parsing with `sympify`.\n</tag_patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n<tag_correct_location_exp>\nYes, the candidate patch modifies the `_print_MatAdd` function which is specifically involved in handling and printing `MatAdd` expressions. The issue revolves around parsing and pretty printing expressions involving `MatAdd`, making it the correct function within the provided context.\n</tag_correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n<tag_new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not change `_print_ImmutableMatrix`, `_print_MatrixBase`, or the initial part of `_print_MatAdd`. Instead, it correctly modifies `_print_MatAdd` to no longer rely on `sympify`. However, it does introduce tighter coupling: `as_coeff_Mul` method and assuming negative coefficients. Direct printing negations seem right but more complex validation needed for full integration.\n</tag_new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n<tag_fix_issue_exp>\nThe changed patch shifts check from `sympify` logic to directly using term coefficients with `as_coeff_Mul()` which addresses the parsing failures of `sympify` accurately. This proposed change prevents `SyntaxError` linked to `sympify` by directly tackling the proper substitution and negated terms using `sympy` consistency reduces typical sympy pitfalls introduce initialized here representation.\n</tag_fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n<tag_score>8</tag_score>"

The error explains that the code shouldn't use `sympify` to handle string arguments from `MatrixSymbol`. Additionally, there seems to be a redundant check for negative arguments which causes an incorrect omission of the `+` operator in the pretty-printed output. The underlying problem is a `SympifyError` resulting from the improper handling of the string argument.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2.

Checking if the Patch Fixes the Correct Function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_print_MatAdd` method directly, which is the same function where the issue with improper handling of arguments leading to a `SympifyError` and syntax error occurred.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking for New Issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch maintains consistency with similar formatting functions within the pretty printer while simplifying the code by removing unnecessary sympification. There doesn't appear to be any new issues introduced by this patch, nor does it contradict the identified code spans related to matrix printing and formatting.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch eliminates the erroneous use of `sympify` and deals more directly with the format of terms for `MatAdd` without additional complex transformations. By explicitly checking the sign of coefficients and formatting them accordingly, the patch adequately addresses the traceback error caused by unexpected input during pretty printing. These modifications align with addressing specific issues like avoiding improper concatenation for elements expected to follow special patterns.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Instead of using `S(item.args[0]).is_negative`, it checks `item.is_negative` which is a safe and appropriate alternative that avoids the problem mentioned in the issue description without introducing compatibility issues or errors elsewhere.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly adjusts the behavior of the `_print_MatAdd` method by avoiding the sympify conversion. Changing the method to `item.is_negative` addresses the root cause (failure of pretty printing with non-alphanumeric characters) appropriately without shortcuts leading to unnecessary complexity or errors, indicating the patch fixes the issue.\n\nPotential issues with LLMs generated patches usually involve inadequately understanding the library API or data objects, handling syntax/casting inappropriately, and inflicting unintentional side-effects in other functionalities, but none of these concerns present in this patch; hence, it seems well-constructed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
