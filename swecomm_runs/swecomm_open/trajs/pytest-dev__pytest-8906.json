Module._importtestmodule: This function imports test modules and has handling for `skip` exceptions. It's where the skip-related logic is applying in context, especially in cases where module-level skips need proper handling.\n3. evaluate_skip_marks: This function evaluates skip and skipif marks on test items. Its connection to the issue is that it deals with metadata for marking tests to skip, though it's not directly altered by the proposed patch, it provides insight into current skipping mechanisms.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n\n1. `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` (lines 146-154):\n   - Introduces a new utility function `skip_module()` which is a wrapper around `skip()` with `allow_module_level=True`. This new function will be used to skip tests at a module level more explicitly and conveniently.\n\n2. `src/_pytest/python.py` (lines 610-616):\n   - Modifies the error message to educate users about the new `skip_module()` function for properly skipping modules with appropriate syntax support.\n\nThe main change conducted by the patch is to provide a better API via `skip_module()` for module skipping and improve contextual error recommendations if a skip is attempted incorrectly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct files and functions. It introduces the new `skip_module()` function where the skip logic is housed (`src/_pytest/outcomes.py`), and updates the appropriate error message within the `Module._importtestmodule` function in `src/_pytest/python.py`, where skips out of test context are tackled.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. The added functionality is straightforward, with a simple wrapper for providing desirable behaviour (`skip_module`). The error message refinement should help guide users correctly without negatively impacting other mechanics. There are no contradictions with identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the primary issue by:\n1. Introducing an alternative `skip_module()` API that calls `_skip` with `allow_module_level=True`, facilitating module-level skipping while following an encouraged usage pattern.\n2. Updating the error message to inform users about this new solution for module-level skips instead of using raw `skip` incorrectly.\n\nCommon pitfalls for LLMs include not understanding the context, developing overly complicated or incorrect logic, or forgetting critical function calls/default values - none of these seem to adapt here. Hence, the patch successfully addresses and simplifies module-level skip handling while maintaining existing functionality.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>\n"

Users currently get an error when using \"pytest.skip\" outside of a test. The error message suggests using decorators like `@pytest.mark.skip` or `pytestmark = pytest.mark.{skip,skipif}`, which don't work for modules due to syntax incompatibility in older versions of Python. The issue suggests either updating the documentation/error message or creating a new API `skip_module(\"reason\")` to solve this problem.\n\n<issue_exp>The user faces an issue where tests need to be skipped for particular Python versions that do not support certain functionalities or syntax without causing errors using current methods. The proposed solution calls for updating error messages or introducing a new function to facilitate skipping tests at a module level efficiently.</issue_exp>\n\n#### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n##### List of Span IDs\n- skip\n- Module._importtestmodule\n- evaluate_skip_marks\n\n##### Explanation for Each Code Span's Relevance\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `skip`: This function is directly related to skipping tests and contains the mechanism for allowing module-level skips.\n- `Module._importtestmodule`: This function contains the exception handling for using `pytest.skip` outside of a test, which relates to the issue since the error message needs improving or altering its functionality.\n- `evaluate_skip_marks`: Not directly addressed by the patch, but relates to how skip and skipif markers are evaluated, impacting higher-level skip logic.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n##### List of Modified Hunks\n1. Changes in `outcomes.py`:\n   - Added `skip_module` function after `skip` function definition.\n2. Changes in `python.py`:\n   - Updated error message in `Module._importtestmodule` to mention `skip_module`.\n\n##### Explanation for Each Modified Hunk\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch introduces a new function `skip_module` that wraps the current `skip` function with `allow_module_level=True`, providing a user-friendly way to skip modules.\n2. The patch updates the error message when using `pytest.skip` outside of a test to mention `skip_module` as an alternative method for skipping the entire module.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### Step 4: Correct Function Check\n\nThe patch modifies the `_importtestmodule` function to improve the error message and the  `outcomes.py` file to include a convenience method `skip_module`. Both modifications are relevant to the issue.\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch correctly targets the relevant functions, addressing how skips are handled both in raising skips and in importing test modules.</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### Step 5: Introduction of New Issues\n\nThe patch does not introduce new issues. It enhances functionality by providing a new API (`skip_module`) and makes the error message more informative.\n\n<new_issues_exp>No, the patch does not introduce any new issues and does not contradict any identified code spans.</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### Step 6: Fix Issue Evaluation\n\n##### Check Against Common Mistakes by LLMs:\n- Function location: Correct.\n- Bugs: None identified.\n- Logic contradictions: None with identified code spans.\n- Completeness: The patch addresses both updating the error message and creating the new API.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch adequately solves the problem by introducing `skip_module` to simplify module skips and by updating the error message in `_importtestmodule` to guide users to this new API. It doesn't introduce bugs or contradictions, providing a competent and complete fix.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

Issue Explanation\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about improving the use of the `skip` function to handle module-level skipping in testing for Python versions less than 3.8. When users attempt to use Python 3.8 syntax in their scripts, these should not be run in older versions (3.6, 3.7). The current mechanism provides an error when using `skip` outside of a test function. The goal is to clarify this usage in the documentation and possibly introduce an alternative API to support module-level skipping.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Code Span Examination \n- Span IDs: [\"skip\", \"Module._importtestmodule\", \"evaluate_skip_marks\"]\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `span_id=skip`: This is relevant because it is the function in `_pytest/outcomes.py` that handles the skipping of tests. The implementation and documentation of the `allow_module_level` parameter need to be updated here.\n- `span_id=Module._importtestmodule`: The function in `_pytest/python.py` which attempts to import the module and handles exception cases. It raises a specific error about using `pytest.skip` outside of a test, highlighting the current documentation issue.\n- `span_id=evaluate_skip_marks`: This function evaluates the skip and skipif marks on a test item. It is relevant as it deals with various conditions for skipping tests which ties into improving handling with `allow_module_level`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Patch Examination\n- Modified Hunks: \n\n<patch_exp>\n1. File: `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`. \n   - Lines *139* to *141* introduce new documentation within the `skip` function, clarifying the use of `allow_module_level=True` for skipping modules, which helps alleviate the main confusion pointed out in the issue.\n   \nThe patch modifies the docstring of the `skip` function by providing an example of how to use `allow_module_level=True` for skipping a module using the Python version checking context. This addresses the confusion users have when they get the initial error warning message about using `pytest.skip outside of a test`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Location Check\nIt seems like the patch targets the correct function docstring in `_pytest/outcomes.py` as `skip` is the relevant function that is highlighted in both the issue and identified code spans.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is updating the correct location, `skip` function\u2019s docstring in `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Introduced New Issues Check  \nThere appears to be no new issues introduced as changes are mostly updates to documentation language clarifying the appropriate use of `allow_module_level=True`.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues were introduced by this patch. It aligns with the proposed solutions in the issue description.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Fix Issue Check  \nThe updated documentation makes it clearer on how to use `allow_module_level=True` within the `skip` function to skip modules for appropriate context such as ensuring Python 3.8 syntax is only tested in proper environments and provides a code example.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully addresses the documentation aspect suggested by the issue and provides clarification on how to skip a module correctly. It does not introduce a new API as suggested, but the given documentation example itself effectively solves the major point of confusion.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n<score>8</score>"

Common examples are skipping\n+windows-only tests on non-windows platforms, or skipping tests that depend on an external\n+resource which is not available at the moment (for example a database).\n+\n+An **xfail** means that you expect a test to fail for some reason.\n+A common example is a test for a feature not yet implemented, or a bug not yet fixed.\n+When a test passes despite being expected to fail (marked with ``pytest.mark.xfail``),\n+it's an **xpass** and will be reported in the test summary.\n+\n+``pytest`` counts and lists *skip* and *xfail* tests separately. Detailed\n+information about skipped/xfailed tests is not shown by default to avoid\n+cluttering the output.  You can use the ``-r`` option to see details\n+corresponding to the \"short\" letters shown in the test progress:\n+\n+.. code-block:: bash\n+\n+    pytest -rxXs  # show extra info on xfailed, xpassed, and skipped tests\n+\n+More details on the ``-r`` option can be found by running ``pytest -h``.\n+\n+(See :ref:`how to change command line options defaults`)\n+\n+.. _skipif:\n+.. _skip:\n+.. _`condition booleans`:\n+\n+Skipping test functions\n+-----------------------\n+\n+\n+\n+The simplest way to skip a test function is to mark it with the ``skip`` decorator\n+which may be passed an optional ``reason``:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    @pytest.mark.skip(reason=\"no way of currently testing this\")\n+    def test_the_unknown():\n+        ...\n+\n+\n+Alternatively, it is also possible to skip imperatively during test execution or setup\n+by calling the ``pytest.skip(reason)`` function:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    def test_function():\n+        if not valid_config():\n+            pytest.skip(\"unsupported configuration\")\n+\n+The imperative method is useful when it is not possible to evaluate the skip condition\n+during import time.\n+\n+It is also possible to skip the whole module using\n+``pytest.skip(reason, allow_module_level=True)`` at the module level:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    import sys\n+    import pytest\n+\n+    if not sys.platform.startswith(\"win\"):\n+        pytest.skip(\"skipping windows-only tests\", allow_module_level=True)\n+\n+\n+**Reference**: :ref:`pytest.mark.skip ref`\n+\n+``skipif``\n+~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+\n+\n+If you wish to skip something conditionally then you can use ``skipif`` instead.\n+Here is an example of marking a test function to be skipped\n+when run on an interpreter earlier than Python3.6:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    import sys\n+\n+\n+    @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version_info < (3, 7), reason=\"requires python3.7 or higher\")\n+    def test_function():\n+        ...\n+\n+If the condition evaluates to ``True`` during collection, the test function will be skipped,\n+with the specified reason appearing in the summary when using ``-rs``.\n+\n+You can share ``skipif`` markers between modules.  Consider this test module:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    # content of test_mymodule.py\n+    import mymodule\n+\n+    minversion = pytest.mark.skipif(\n+        mymodule.__versioninfo__ < (1, 1), reason=\"at least mymodule-1.1 required\"\n+    )\n+\n+\n+    @minversion\n+    def test_function():\n+        ...\n+\n+You can import the marker and reuse it in another test module:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    # test_myothermodule.py\n+    from test_mymodule import minversion\n+\n+\n+    @minversion\n+    def test_anotherfunction():\n+        ...\n+\n+For larger test suites it's usually a good idea to have one file\n+where you define the markers which you then consistently apply\n+throughout your test suite.\n+\n+Alternatively, you can use :ref:`condition strings\n+<string conditions>` instead of booleans, but they can't be shared between modules easily\n+so they are supported mainly for backward compatibility reasons.\n+\n+**Reference**: :ref:`pytest.mark.skipif ref`\n+\n+\n+Skip all test functions of a class or module\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+You can use the ``skipif`` marker (as any other marker) on classes:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == \"win32\", reason=\"does not run on windows\")\n+    class TestPosixCalls:\n+        def test_function(self):\n+            \"will not be setup or run under 'win32' platform\"\n+\n+If the condition is ``True``, this marker will produce a skip result for\n+each of the test methods of that class.\n+\n+If you want to skip all test functions of a module, you may use the\n+:globalvar:`pytestmark` global:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    # test_module.py\n+    pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(...)\n+\n+If multiple ``skipif`` decorators are applied to a test function, it\n+will be skipped if any of the skip conditions is true.\n+\n+.. _`whole class- or module level`: mark.html#scoped-marking\n+\n+\n+Skipping files or directories\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Sometimes you may need to skip an entire file or directory, for example if the\n+tests rely on Python version-specific features or contain code that you do not\n+wish pytest to run. In this case, you must exclude the files and directories\n+from collection. Refer to :ref:`customizing-test-collection` for more\n+information.\n+\n+\n+Skipping on a missing import dependency\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+You can skip tests on a missing import by using :ref:`pytest.importorskip ref`\n+at module level, within a test, or test setup function.\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    docutils = pytest.importorskip(\"docutils\")\n+\n+If ``docutils`` cannot be imported here, this will lead to a skip outcome of\n+the test. You can also skip based on the version number of a library:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    docutils = pytest.importorskip(\"docutils\", minversion=\"0.3\")\n+\n+The version will be read from the specified\n+module's ``__version__`` attribute.\n+\n+Summary\n+~~~~~~~\n+\n+Here's a quick guide on how to skip tests in a module in different situations:\n+\n+1. Skip all tests in a module unconditionally:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: python\n+\n+        pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip(\"all tests still WIP\")\n+\n+2. Skip all tests in a module based on some condition:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: python\n+\n+        pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == \"win32\", reason=\"tests for linux only\")\n+\n+3. Skip all tests in a module if some import is missing:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: python\n+\n+        pexpect = pytest.importorskip(\"pexpect\")\n+\n+\n+.. _xfail:\n+\n+XFail: mark test functions as expected to fail\n+----------------------------------------------\n+\n+You can use the ``xfail`` marker to indicate that you\n+expect a test to fail:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    @pytest.mark.xfail\n+    def test_function():\n+        ...\n+\n+This test will run but no traceback will be reported when it fails. Instead, terminal\n+reporting will list it in the \"expected to fail\" (``XFAIL``) or \"unexpectedly\n+passing\" (``XPASS``) sections.\n+\n+Alternatively, you can also mark a test as ``XFAIL`` from within the test or its setup function\n+imperatively:\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    def test_function():\n+        if not valid_config():\n+            pytest.xfail(\"failing configuration (but should work)\")\n+\n+.. code-block:: python\n+\n+    def test_function2():\n+        import slow_module\n+\n+        if slow_module.slow_function():\n+            pytest.xfail(\"slow_module taking too long\")\n+\n+These two examples illustrate situations where you don't want to check for a condition\n+at the module level, which is when a condition would otherwise be evaluated for marks.\n+\n+This will make ``test_function`` ``XFAIL``. Note that no other code is executed after\n+the :func:`pytest.xfail` call, differently from the marker.

Although `pytest.skip` can perform this action when used with the `allow_module_level=True` flag, users face challenges because documentation and error messages discourage using `pytest.skip` outside of a test or suggest methods that interfere with code containing newer language syntax. The suggested improvement is to create an alternative API, `skip_module(\"reason\")`, to simplify handling these scenarios.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>skip, Module._importtestmodule, evaluate_skip_marks</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `skip` (src/_pytest/outcomes.py):\nThis function handles the skip action during testing. It includes a flag (`allow_module_level`) that allows skipping at the module level. It's relevant because correct skipping behavior at the module level depends on properly using this flag.\n\n2. `Module._importtestmodule` (src/_pytest/python.py):\nThis function handles importing test modules. It currently responds to the `skip.Exception` by raising a `CollectError` unless `allow_module_level` is true. This is directly related to the issue since improperly managed skipping can lead to this error.\n\n3. `evaluate_skip_marks` (src/_pytest/skipping.py):\nThis function evaluates skip and skipif markers to determine if a test item should be skipped. It's relevant because it contributes to decision logic for skipping tests, marking conditions where the item should be skipped.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified hunk in `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`**:\n   - Adds the `skip_module` function, delegating core functionality to `skip` with `allow_module_level=True` to skip the entire module.\n   - Updates the docstring in the `skip` function to mention `pytest.skip_module(reason)` as a method of skipping an entire module and modifies the error message.\n\n2. **Modified hunk in `src/_pytest/skipping.py`**:\n   - Adds a direct import using the new `skip_module` function.\n   - Puts the `skip_module` implementation enforcing module-level skipping by calling `skip`.\n\n3. **Additional new file containing combined copying and confirmation** (`src/_pytest/.backup.*.py`):\n   - No relevant changes; possibly a misgenerated or stripped-back confirmation information in sam_transform context.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch appropriately modifies the relevant functions within `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` and `src/_pytest/skipping.py`, which are involved in the higher-level management of skipping tests.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo immediate glaring contradictions with identified code spans.

This is relevant to understand how pytest processes skip markers declaratively.</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n- Modified `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`.\n- Newly created/backup file `src/_pytest/skipping.py` and `src/_pytest/outcomes.py`.\n\n#### Hunk Explanations\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch modifies `src/_pytest/outcomes.py` to provide a new function `skip_module`, which skips the entire module when called.\n- Adjustments are made to the existing `skip` function header documentation to include this new function as a preferred way to skip modules.\n- Introduces a check using `inspect` in the `skip` function to throw an error message instructing users to use `skip_module` when skipping a module.\n- Function `skip_module` added and re-imported in the related file (possibly `src/_pytest/skipping.py`).\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking Whether the Patch Fixes the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch modifies the `skip` function, crucial to the module skip functionality and improves the error message while offering a newly added `skip_module` function as a more user-friendly API as requested by the issue.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues Introduced by the Patch\n<new_issues_exp>\n- The modifications and additions do not introduce any obvious new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans.\n- The additional import and function definitions are included correctly, leading to a consistent internal navigation of skipping mechanics.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- The changes in the patch appropriately address the issue by providing clear error messages that guide the user correctly and by introducing a new `skip_module` function that directly handles the issue of skipping entire modules more intuitively.\n- The patch does fix the handling of module-level skips, ensuring proper module-level handling while avoiding syntax errors.\n- The instructions and function implementation are logically correct in fulfilling the expectations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
