This becomes a problem in scenarios where the method of the request should change according to standard HTTP practices\u2014for example, converting a POST request to a GET request after receiving a 303 status code. The result is that in subsequent redirects (e.g., HTTP 307), which should repeat the last method used, the original POST method is incorrectly repeated.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_id_list>SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects</span_id_list>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span identified with span_id `SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects` is directly relevant to the issue because it includes the implementation of the `resolve_redirects` method. Specifically:\n- Line 0084-0085, defining the function header and immediate lines relevant to the redirect mechanics.\n- Line 0091 shows where the original request object is copied for each redirect (`prepared_request = req.copy()`), which is the root cause of the issue described.\n- Line 0124-0136 provide the logic for method selection depending on the redirect status codes (e.g., changing POST to GET).\nThe candidate patch is likely to involve changes within this span to ensure the request method is properly maintained through a series of redirects.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk 1: \n   - Before: `prepared_request = req.copy()` on line 0091.\n   - After: Change to `prepared_request = resp.request.copy()`. \n   - Explanation: This change alters the code so that instead of copying the original request (`req`), the newly prepared request is based on the last response's request. This means it will respect modified methods (e.g., changed from POST to GET) by respond headers such as 303 See Other or 307 Temporary Redirect, thus addressing the root of the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct location in the code. It modifies the line within the `resolve_redirects` method where the original request object was being copied anew for each redirection, changing it to copy the last request object instead.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and aligns with how the code span operates. By using `resp.request.copy()` instead of `req.copy()`, it integrates well with the existing mechanics of redirection handling\u2014including method modifications and adjustments based on differing status codes (like changing POST to GET for 303 responses). There are no contractions between the patch and the operation of identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly fixes the issue by ensuring that each subsequent request in a chain of redirects will inherit the method and other properties from the most recent request, not the original request, respecting HTTP standard behaviors for status code like 303, 307 etc. This prevents further incorrect method preservations such as trying to resend a POST request when it should already have transformed into a GET based on intermediate redirects.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Currently, the method reuses the original request object during redirections. This can lead to inappropriate HTTP method use after certain redirects. For example, a `POST` request converted to a `GET` by a 303 status should headline a chain of GET requests, but the `Session.resolve_redirects` erroneously continues with a `POST` after a further 307 redirect.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan IDs:\n- SessionRedirectMixin.resolve_redirects\n\nThe code span highlights the `resolve_redirects` method that handles redirection responses, sequentially adjusting the method and retrying, typically used for handling 3xx responses. Since the bug is specifically regarding improperly retaining the original request method across redirections, this function is directly impacted. Any edits needed to handle the preservation of method state in redirections must be done within this function.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. Removing the `session` import in `requests/__init__.py`.\n2. Significantly rewriting `requests/sessions.py` removing attributes and methods albeit simplistically outlining a basic `Session` class structure and integrating `unittest`.\n3. Creating new file `test_redirects_fix.py` to integrate `unittest`.\n\nExplanations:\n1. The import statement from `requests.sessions` that imported `session` alongside `Session` has been removed likely because the `Session` class directly addresses import concerns.\n2. Simplified the `SessionRedirectMixin` removing previous method behavior with a pass statement not curing the bug, eliminating functionality from class methodology; superfluous trimming can create potential regressions and accumulating faults disjoining purpose within the entire design.\n3. Creating a unifying test to check HTTP behaviour, consolidates tests. Adding mock responses and adequately ensuring resolutions aid procedural validation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch does aim at the correct function involved in the erroneous redirect handling, specifically the `resolve_redirects` method within the `SessionRedirectMixin` that essentially embodies the fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe simplified `self.resolve_redirects` in the patch notably lacks meaningful logic, eliciting null culmination with dependencies for correct HTTP connections retention, contradicts heavily protocol specifications pursuit behavior.\nPatch introduces inconsistencies obviating functionalities presumed in initialized key methods (within `request & send process`.)
