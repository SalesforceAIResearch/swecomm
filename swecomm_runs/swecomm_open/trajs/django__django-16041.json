This method includes form initialization with various keyword arguments including `form_kwargs`, where `empty_permitted` ends up causing a `KeyError` if specified.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Explanation of candidate patch\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n\n- Hunk 1:\n  ```diff\n  @property\n  def empty_form(self):\n+     form_kwargs = self.get_form_kwargs(None)\n+     form_kwargs.pop('empty_permitted', None)\n      form = self.form(\n          auto_id=self.auto_id,\n          prefix=self.add_prefix(\"__prefix__\"),\n          empty_permitted=True,\n          use_required_attribute=False,\n-         **self.get_form_kwargs(None),\n+         **form_kwargs,\n          renderer=self.renderer,\n      )\n      self.add_fields(form, None)\n      return form\n  ```\n\n<patch_exp>\n\n- **Hunk 1:**\n  The patch modifies the `empty_form` property. It introduces a local dictionary `form_kwargs` obtained from `self.get_form_kwargs(None)` and immediately removes the 'empty_permitted' key from `form_kwargs` if it exists. Subsequently, this modified `form_kwargs` is used for initializing the form object, thereby preventing a possible `KeyError` caused by an 'empty_permitted' key within `form_kwargs`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Fixing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is indeed addressing the correct function associated with the issue. It directly modifies the `BaseFormSet.empty_form` method, which is the root cause of the `KeyError` when 'empty_permitted' is set in `form_kwargs`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introduction of new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues. The pop method will safely remove 'empty_permitted' if it exists and do nothing if it doesn\u2019t, so there are no concerns about raising exceptions or causing incorrect behavior elsewhere.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Efficacy of the patch in fixing the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the problem by removing 'empty_permitted' from the form\u2019s keyword arguments before initializing the form. This ensures that the form is created successfully without raising a `KeyError`. The modifications have been reviewed and align with the common errors patched appropriately. Thus, this patch can fix the reported issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any directly evident new issues.

Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately removes the specific setting of `empty_permitted=True` in `BaseFormSet.empty_form`. It ensures that if `empty_permitted` is unwanted or unnecessary in specific cases, it will not cause a KeyError due to hardcoding. The fix rightly allows other configurations to take precedence with the specified `get_form_kwargs()` logic.\nThere might be an oversight if users' get_form_kwargs() does not properly default the `empty_permitted` attribute; careful testing and review should accompany deployment.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

When this attribute is included, it results in an error within the system, disrupting the expected behavior.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- List of span ids:\n  - BaseFormSet.empty_form\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **BaseFormSet.empty_form**:\n   This code span consists of the property definition for `BaseFormSet.empty_form` in the `django/forms/formsets.py` file. It initializes an empty form using the specified configurations and parameters. This span includes the line that causes the `KeyError` due to the unnecessary inclusion of the `empty_permitted` attribute. Removing or ignoring `empty_permitted` within `empty_form` processing will address the reported issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\n- Modified Hunks List:\n  - Hunks modifying lines around `BaseFormSet.empty_form`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk Modifying `BaseFormSet.empty_form`:**\n   - This modification operates within the `BaseFormSet.empty_form` property.\n   - It first retrieves the `form_kwargs` dictionary by calling `self.get_form_kwargs(None)`.\n   - It then removes the `empty_permitted` key from `form_kwargs`, if it exists, using `form_kwargs.pop('empty_permitted', None)`.\n   - After purging the `empty_permitted` key, it constructs the form object using the adjusted `form_kwargs`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct location within the codebase. The identified code spans directly reference `empty_form`, which aligns perfectly with the modification aimed to rectify this issue. The patch addresses the incorrect handling of `empty_permitted` by excluding it before constructing the form.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking if the Patch Introduces New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any new issues when addressing the `empty_permitted` key removal from `empty_form`. It preserves the necessary original configurations passed to form creation but without the `empty_permitted` extra key, ensuring other attributes function as expected.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch should resolve the issue as it directly removes the irrelevant `empty_permitted` key from the `form_kwargs` before they're used in `empty_form`. This change addresses the cause of the `KeyError` as specified in the issue description. This aligns with the typical issue where disallowed properties are included, and their exclusion should sufficiently provide a resolution without breaking the logical flow.\nNo common LLM mistakes were identified here, as the patch focuses on removing a specific key from a dictionary without interacting with broader parts or functions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nOverall, the patch correctly addresses the issue without introducing new problems or contradictions. Therefore, I'll score it as follows:\n<score>10</score>"

The specific context where this occurs is when trying to render a template utilizing a formset's `empty_form`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue occurs when the `form_kwargs` dictionary contains the `empty_permitted` key set to either `True` or `False`. When rendering a formset's `empty_form`, a `KeyError` is raised. The `empty_permitted` is supposed to be ignored for `formset.empty_form` since it is irrelevant in that context.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Understanding\n**Step 2: Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n\nIdentified Code Span IDs:\n1. django/forms/formsets.py span_id=BaseFormSet.empty_form\n\nExplanation of Identified Code Spans:\n- **Span ID `BaseFormSet.empty_form`**: This property in `django/forms/formsets.py` returns an empty form for the formset. It passes relevant attributes to create the empty form, including `empty_permitted`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **Span ID `BaseFormSet.empty_form`**: This property method is responsible for creating and returning an empty form for the formset. The existing implementation sets `empty_permitted` to `True` directly while calling the form's constructor and also accepts `**self.get_form_kwargs(None)`, which can include `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs`, causing potential conflicts or redundant settings.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Understanding\n**Step 3: Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\nModified Hunk:\n```\n@django/forms/formsets.py:\n-         return self.forms[self.initial_form_count() :]\n-\n-     @property\n-     def empty_form(self):\n-         form = self.form(\n-             auto_id=self.auto_id,\n-             prefix=self.add_prefix(\"__prefix__\"),\n-             empty_permitted=True,\n-             use_required_attribute=False,\n-             **self.get_form_kwargs(None),\n-             renderer=self.renderer,\n-         )\n-         self.add_fields(form, None)\n-         return form\n++++++++++\n+\n+     @property\n+     def empty_form(self):\n+         form_kwargs = self.get_form_kwargs(None)\n+         form_kwargs.pop('empty_permitted', None)  # Remove empty_permitted if present\n+         form = self.form(\n+             auto_id=self.auto_id,\n+             prefix=self.add_prefix(\"__prefix__\"),\n+             empty_permitted=True,\n+             use_required_attribute=False,\n+             **form_kwargs,\n+             renderer=self.renderer,\n+         )\n+         self.add_fields(form, None)\n+         return form\n         \n@tests/forms_tests/tests/test_formsets.py:\n+     def test_empty_form_with_empty_permitted(self):\n+         FormSet = formset_factory(Choice, extra=1)\n+         formset = FormSet(form_kwargs={'empty_permitted': True})\n+         self.assertTrue(formset.empty_form.empty_permitted)\n+                                                 \n+         formset = FormSet(form_kwargs={'empty_permitted': False})\n+         self.assertTrue(formset.empty_form.empty_permitted)\n+\n```\n\nExplanation of the modified hunk:\n- **In `django/forms/formsets.py`**: The `empty_form` property is modified to pop out the `empty_permitted` key from `form_kwargs` if it exists. This prevents the `KeyError` by ensuring that `empty_permitted` does not cause conflicts.\n- **In `tests/forms_tests/tests/test_formsets.py`**: A new test method `test_empty_form_with_empty_permitted` is added to verify that `empty_form` respects the hardcoded `empty_permitted=True`, even if `form_kwargs` contains `empty_permitted`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the `empty_form` property in `django/forms/formsets.py`, ensuring that `empty_permitted` is removed from `form_kwargs` if it exists to avoid the `KeyError`.\n2. A new test `test_empty_form_with_empty_permitted` is added in `tests/forms_tests/tests/test_formsets.py` to verify the corrected behavior of `empty_form`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Fix Location Check\n**Step 4: Check if the Patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The issue is specifically in the `empty_form` property of the `BaseFormSet` class where `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` was conflicting with a hardcoded `empty_permitted=True`. Modifying and testing this function directly addresses the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n**Step 5: Check for New Issues**\nThe patch does not introduce new issues based on the identified code spans. Removing `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` before instantiation of the form and verifying this in the associated tests is appropriate.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It modifies the relevant part (`empty_form` property) directly and ensures proper behavior by removing the conflict with `empty_permitted`. The added tests further confirm that the property works as expected.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Validation\n**Step 6: Validate the Issue Fix**\n- **Common LLM Errors**:\n  1. Incorrect function being patched: Not applicable here.\n  2. Syntax Errors or Code Style Issues: Did not find any.\n  3. Logic Mistakes or Overcomplicated Implementations: The logic is straightforward and correct. It simplifies handling `empty_permitted`.\n  4. New bugs or changes in behaviors: The new behavior is precisely what's needed: to ensure `empty_permitted` in `form_kwargs` isn't applied to the `empty_form`.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue effectively by removing `empty_permitted` from `form_kwargs` if it exists before creating an `empty_form`. The correction is properly targeted and the changes are verified using additional test cases. The fix adheres to necessary coding standards and does not introduce any new issues or unexpected behavior.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring\n<score>10</score>"

The concrete issue resides within this method because it derives the form configuration from `self.get_form_kwargs(None)` and includes `empty_permitted` parameter directly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Patch insertion in `django/forms/formsets.py`****:\n   - Before: In the `empty_form` property method, `empty_permitted` directly comes from form_kwargs.\n   - After: The patch removes 'empty_permitted' from the `form_kwargs` dictionary before passing the kwargs to the form initialization.\n2. **Patch addition in `tests/forms_tests/tests/test_formsets.py`**:\n   - Before: There was no test to validate `empty_form` ignoring `empty_permitted`.\n   - After: The patch adds a new test to ensure `empty_form` correctly ignores the `empty_permitted` key in `form_kwargs`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct location. The issue pinpoints the problem within the construction of `empty_form` by `BaseFormSet` where the invalid key `empty_permitted` needs to be omitted from `form_kwargs` before the form instantiation.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. Moreover, it covers the targeted problem of inadvertently validating empty forms using `empty_permitted` by testing both cases (`empty_permitted` being `True` or `False`).\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the problem correctly by ensuring `empty_permitted` is consistently set to `True` for `empty_form`, regardless of whether `form_kwargs` includes `empty_permitted`. This prevention eliminates the source of the `KeyError`. Additionally, it integrates unit test modifications to assert this functionality expressly, covering the edge cases to close potential gaps. There are no omitted consequences such as JSON serialization issues, client-server synchronization or logic beyond the introduced patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
