It currently ensures that all elements within the cycle notation appear only once and raises errors for invalid inputs. The identified code sections focus on the enforcement of uniqueness within cycle notations, handling different types of inputs (such as `Cycle` and `Permutation`), and constructing the permutation array form.\n\n2. **Permutation.list**\n   This method returns the permutation as an explicit list. It includes handling `size` to allow or trim unchanged elements. Since this directly relates to how the resulting permutation should be outputted, any changes in handling cycles within `Permutation.__new__` would affect how permutations are listed here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Modified Hunks Explanations\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk modifying lines from 439 to 457 in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`\n- Hunk modifying lines from 893 to 926 in `sympy/combinatorics/permutations.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1: Lines 439 to 457**:\n   - **Before patch**:\n     Here, the code is raising a `ValueError` if there are duplicate elements within the cycle notation.\n   - **After patch**:\n     The new `elif` condition (`elif is_sequence(args[0]):`) identifies sequences passed within the constructor and flattens them for further processing.\n\n2. **Hunk 2: Lines 893 to 926**:\n   - **Before patch**:\n     This portion handled permutations, enforcing uniqueness of elements and raised relevant errors upon detecting duplicates.\n   - **After patch**:\n     Instead of raising an error for repeated elements in cycle notations, the patch modifies the handling within the cycle block at lines 911-914.

This merges all cycles into a final list.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Function Location Analysis\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function.

It correctly handles non-disjoint cycles by treating them in sequential order and resolves internal permutations through list conversions.

Permutation.__new__\n2. Permutation.list\n\n**Explanation of Relevance:**\n\n- **Permutation.__new__**  \n\n  This code span containts the main constructor that initializes the `Permutation` object in various forms, including handling list of lists (cyclic) representations of permutations. This is directly relevant because the mentioned issue involves the `Permutation` constructor.\n\n- **Permutation.list**  \n\n  This method converts the permutation into an explicit list representation. It is crucial for ensuring that the final permutation from cyclic forms is correctly implemented in array format.

Modification in the handling portion of is_cycle inside `Permutation.__new__`.\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**  \nThe patch alters the way non-disjoint cycles are handled within the `Permutation` constructor. Instead of raising an error when encountering duplicate elements, the modified implementation constructs an array form by applying the cycles in the expected left-to-right order.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `_new` function such that it now considers the non-disjoint cycles and applies them in left-to-right order to form the resulting permutation. Specifically, the patch introduces a new array `aform`, which is initialized to the range of integers up to the maximum cycle value, adjusting the indices based on input cycles.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Check\n\nThe patch modifies code within the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class, which is exactly where the cycle handling is carried out. From the issue description and identified code span, this is the relevant place for implementing the changes required to handle non-disjoint cycles properly.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the `__new__` method of the `Permutation` class, which is the relevant location for handling non-disjoint cycles as described in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: New Issues Introduction\n\nThere is a potential introduction of issues with incorrect assumptions on cycle integrity, as there could be unintended side effects if cycle lengths or elements exceed expectations. Additionally, integrating changes without proper testing on varied examples might leave edge cases unhandled.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not immediately appear to introduce any new issues, though it is crucial that proper tests are conducted to confirm its behavior under all intended use cases. Unintended side effects related to improper handling of exotic input cycles could surface without comprehensive testing.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Issue-Fixing Capability\n\nThe patch addresses the specific problem mentioned in the issue by modifying the algorithm to handle non-disjoint cycles without raising an exception. Comparing this change with common mistakes made by LLMs shows it is purposefully placed and considers aspects of cycle integration in permutation ordering. This ensures it tackles the main problem straightforwardly.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch should adequately resolve the primary issue mentioned, ensuring non-disjoint cycles are correctly handled in the `Permutation` constructor.

Instead of constructing the identity permutation, the current system wrongly rejects these inputs.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\nIdentified code spans and descriptions:\n- `Permutation.__new__`: Implements the constructor of the `Permutation` class, containing the handling logic for input cases.\n- `Permutation.list`: Contains the `list` function which converts permutation cycles to list form.\n\nList of Span IDs:\n- `Permutation.__new__`\n- `Permutation.list`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `Permutation.__new__`: This span from the `__new__` constructor is crucial as it deals with parsing and validating the cycles input. Relevant lines handle parsing of cycles, identifying and processing cycles vs list arrangement.\n2. `Permutation.list`: This spans providing functionality for Permutation cycle list conversion which affects cases in which overlapping cycles must be considered and comprehended in a seamless manner. \n\nBoth spans provide the expectations of valid permutation transformation logic and errors raised preventively.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\nModified hunks and explanations:\n- Hunk at lines 904-925.\n    - **Explanation:** Introduces handling logic for non-disjoint cycles when `is_cycle` is `True`, translating overlapping cycle elements applied left-to-right order into an array representing a valid permutation before storing them.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified hunk for lines 904-925: The patch updates how cyclic permutations are processed. When `is_cycle` is `True`, it initializes `aform` from unique input cycles ensuring repeated items are converted through internal indexing correctly rather than automatically routing error paths.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location Check\n\nThe patch is fixing the constructor `__new__`, which is indeed where the logic to determine how permutation inputs, including cycles, should be processed. Hence, the updates make sense in this section of the code being reviewed.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is made at the correct location in the constructor `Permutation.__new__`, which is responsible for processing and handling different forms of permutations, including cyclic ones.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues, as it removes the error-raise condition for non-disjoint cycle identification and appropriately processes them without conflicting with indexed phases represented earlier in code checks.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues; it modifies the behavior at the appropriate place and in a compatible manner with verified syntactical structures and array-form validations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Evaluation\n\nThe patch addresses the identified bug, applies a maintained input in left-right ordered cycles, and results correct permutations as needed. It doesn\u2019t map violation scenarios occurring defaults or unexpected edge cases seen.\n\nConsidering common LLM mistakes: \n1. Incorrect function placement and misjudged accessing were avoided.\n2. Patch leaves strings, ordering sure to comprehensively adapting overlapping cycle placements effectively.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the handling of non-disjoint cycles in permutations within the constructor by ensuring individual cycle elements rightly ordered, arranged without causing errors. There weren\u2019t omitted cases or logical fallacies confirming mistake evaluation reported.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>\n"

The problem arises within this method when handling non-disjoint cycles, as the method currently raises an error upon detecting duplicates in the passed cycles.\n   - **Permutation.list**: This function returns the permutation in list form and it showcases how the `Permutation` class manages permutations, including their conversion and handling. Understanding this function helps in tracking how the resulting permutations should behave.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n1. List of Modified Hunks:\n   - Changes to lines dealing with detecting duplicate elements in cycles and raising `ValueError`.\n\n2. Explanation:\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - The modified code now skips the check for duplicates if `is_cycle` is `True`. Previously, the presence of duplicates would trigger a `ValueError`, but now it allows duplicates to go through if they belong to `Cycle`. The primary function being addressed here is within the `Permutation.__new__` method.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Function Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct function, `Permutation.__new__`. This is where the input cycles are processed and the presence of duplicates was previously leading to errors.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Checking for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to have been introduced by this patch. By removing the block of code that checks and raises errors for duplicate cycle elements when `is_cycle` is `True`, it aligns with the handling needed to interpreting cycles correctly, permitting duplicates specifically in `Cycle`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Evaluating the Fix\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to fix the issue correctly as it allows duplicate elements in cycles by bypassing the `ValueError` that was originally getting raised. \n\nIt correctly alters the logical condition to acknowledge cycles (`is_cycle`) and preserve duplicates, hence matching expected behavior where cycles are applied in succession for deriving permutations.\n\nCommon mistakes to watch for:\n- **Incorrect Handling Outside the Primary Target**: This patch focuses accurately on non-disjoint cycle treatment. It separately does not create side-effect changes for permutation manifestation in non-cyclic contexts (fully considered in other parts).\n   \nGiven described chronological operations on constructor checks and reviews laid down surface adherence, typical contradictory errors cited are additionally substantiated backwardly from cycles to array_form fillers, germane.\n   \nNo indications present falling into categories where patch theoretically/methodically deviates designated functional corrections precisely unearthed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understand the Issue \n\n**Issue Description:**\nThe `Permutation` constructor fails with non-disjoint cycles, raising a `ValueError`. According to the issue, if cycles are non-disjoint, they should be applied in left-to-right order to construct the corresponding permutation, rather than raising an error.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue is that the `Permutation` constructor raises a `ValueError` when provided with non-disjoint cycles. Instead, it should process these non-disjoint cycles in a left-to-right manner to construct the correct permutation, such as the identity permutation, rather than producing an error.</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n* Identified Code Span IDs:\n  - Permutation.__new__\n  - Permutation.list\n  \n**Explanations of relevance:**\n\n- **Permutation.__new__ (span_id=Permutation.__new__)**: This is the constructor method for the `Permutation` class. It's responsible for processing input arguments, identifying cycles, and setting up the permutation. This is the central location where any handling of duplicate elements or cycle notations must be corrected to fix the mentioned issue.\n\n- **Permutation.list (span_id=Permutation.list)**: This method converts the internal representation of the permutation into an explicit list, accommodating potential adjustments in size or format. While not directly responsible for handling inputs, it contributes to the permutation's formation, relevant if understanding how input misinterpretation propagates to users.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- span_id=Permutation.__new__: This method is crucial as it constructs the `Permutation` object, handling cycle extraction and uniqueness checks.\n- span_id=Permutation.list: Converts internally-stored permutations to explicit lists, which encompasses end results possibly impacted by correction processes for input cycles.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n*Modified Hunks:*\n\n1. **Hunk 1:**\n\nBefore:\n```python\nif has_dups(temp):\n    if is_cycle:\n        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements; to resolve cycles use Cycle%s.' % ''.join([str(tuple(c)) for c in args]))\n    else:\n        raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')\n```\n\nAfter:\n```python\nif has_dups(temp) and not is_cycle:\n    raise ValueError('there were repeated elements.')\n```\n\n**Explanation of Changes:**\nIn the modified code, the clause raising `ValueError` when duplicate elements appear is now conditional: duplicates will only lead to errors if the elements are NOT part of the cycle, indicated by the `is_cycle` flag.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1**: This modification alters the behavior such that it no longer raises an error when there are repeated elements if those elements represent cycles. Instead, it silently allows duplicates within cycles as legitimate input.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if Fixing the Correct Function\n\nConsidering the issue description talks about the incorrect behavior triggered in the constructor, the changes in `Permutation.__new__` are appropriately targeted. It corrects input handling regarding non-disjoint cycles within the method meant to initialize such permutations.\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch fixes the correct function. The identified changes are made to `Permutation.__new__`, which is responsible for handling cycle-based constructs, as discovered in the issue description.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check for New Issues or Contradictions\n\nNo immediate contradiction with the identified code spans is apparent. However, it alters the program's handling in a crucial way: Duplicate cycle elements are implicitly managed. This might impact or require adjustments in code interpreting permutations based on internal consistency assumptions.\n\n<new_issues_exp>No direct contradictions are found with identified code spans. However, introducing expansive formatting allowances may incur indirect issues where subsequent code pieces assume stricter conditions on uniqueness of permutation constituents.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Evaluate if Patch Fixes the Issue\n\nThe patch indeed relaxes error conditions for duplicated cycle elements but doesn't explicitly demonstrate left-to-right parsing. It provides the primary suggested feature: allowing legitimate cycles with theoretical duplicates. Serendipitously, inefficiencies assessing left-prioritized, residue, specific results aren\u2019t fault-proof conveyed.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch addresses a significant component by permitting duplicates within cycles: this shouldn't immediately escalate as an issue-retention. The dilemma about `order-efficient` transmissible redundant-clearing modules may be inherently inferred within implied left-processing.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Scoring the Patch\n\nCarefully evaluate overall completeness, issue adherence, location-specific adjustments, and extrapolated minor-inconsistencies versus interpretative handling guidelines and immediate proactive verifiability.\n\n<score>8</score>"

This is entered\n+    in brackets as the argument to the Permutation class:\n+\n+    >>> p = Permutation([0, 2, 1]); p\n+    Permutation([0, 2, 1])\n+\n+    Given i in range(p.size), the permutation maps i to i^p\n+\n+    >>> [i^p for i in range(p.size)]\n+    [0, 2, 1]\n+\n+    The composite of two permutations p*q means first apply p, then q, so\n+    i^(p*q) = (i^p)^q which is i^p^q according to Python precedence rules:\n+\n+    >>> q = Permutation([2, 1, 0])\n+    >>> [i^p^q for i in range(3)]\n+    [2, 0, 1]\n+    >>> [i^(p*q) for i in range(3)]\n+    [2, 0, 1]\n+\n+    One can use also the notation p(i) = i^p, but then the composition\n+    rule is (p*q)(i) = q(p(i)), not p(q(i)):\n+\n+    >>> [(p*q)(i) for i in range(p.size)]\n+    [2, 0, 1]\n+    >>> [q(p(i)) for i in range(p.size)]\n+    [2, 0, 1]\n+    >>> [p(q(i)) for i in range(p.size)]\n+    [1, 2, 0]\n+\n+    Disjoint Cycle Notation\n+    -----------------------\n+\n+    In disjoint cycle notation, only the elements that have shifted are\n+    indicated. In the above case, the 2 and 1 switched places. This can\n+    be entered in two ways:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(1, 2) == Permutation([[1, 2]]) == p\n+    True\n+\n+    Only the relative ordering of elements in a cycle matter:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(1,2,3) == Permutation(2,3,1) == Permutation(3,1,2)\n+    True\n+\n+    The disjoint cycle notation is convenient when representing permutations\n+    that have several cycles in them:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(3, 5) == Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 5]])\n+    True\n+\n+    It also provides some economy in entry when computing products of\n+    permutations that are written in disjoint cycle notation:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(1, 3)(2, 3)\n+    Permutation([0, 3, 2, 1])\n+    >>> _ == Permutation([[1, 2]])*Permutation([[1, 3]])*Permutation([[2, 3]])\n+    True\n+\n+    Entering a singleton in a permutation is a way to indicate the size of the\n+    permutation. The ``size`` keyword can also be used.\n+\n+    Array-form entry:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation([[1, 2], [9]])\n+    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n+    >>> Permutation([[1, 2]], size=10)\n+    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n+\n+    Cyclic-form entry:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(1, 2, size=10)\n+    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n+    >>> Permutation(9)(1, 2)\n+    Permutation([0, 2, 1], size=10)\n+\n+    Caution: no singleton containing an element larger than the largest\n+    in any previous cycle can be entered. This is an important difference\n+    in how Permutation and Cycle handle the __call__ syntax. A singleton\n+    argument at the start of a Permutation performs instantiation of the\n+    Permutation and is permitted:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(5)\n+    Permutation([], size=6)\n+\n+    A singleton entered after instantiation is a call to the permutation\n+    -- a function call -- and if the argument is out of range it will\n+    trigger an error. For this reason, it is better to start the cycle\n+    with the singleton:\n+\n+    The following fails because there is is no element 3:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(3)\n+    Traceback (most recent call last):\n+    ...\n+    IndexError: list index out of range\n+\n+    This is ok: only the call to an out of range singleton is prohibited;\n+    otherwise the permutation autosizes:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(3)(1, 2)\n+    Permutation([0, 2, 1, 3])\n+    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(3, 4) == Permutation(3, 4)(1, 2)\n+    True\n+\n+\n+    Equality testing\n+    ----------------\n+\n+    The array forms must be the same in order for permutations to be equal:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3]) == Permutation([1, 0])\n+    False\n+\n+\n+    Identity Permutation\n+    --------------------\n+\n+    The identity permutation is a permutation in which no element is out of\n+    place. It can be entered in a variety of ways. All the following create\n+    an identity permutation of size 4:\n+\n+    >>> I = Permutation([0, 1, 2, 3])\n+    >>> all(p == I for p in [\n+    ... Permutation(3),\n+    ... Permutation(range(4)),\n+    ... Permutation([], size=4),\n+    ... Permutation(size=4)])\n+    True\n+\n+    Watch out for entering the range *inside* a set of brackets (which is\n+    cycle notation):\n+\n+    >>> I == Permutation([range(4)])\n+    False\n+\n+\n+    Permutation Printing\n+    ====================\n+\n+    There are a few things to note about how Permutations are printed.\n+\n+    1) If you prefer one form (array or cycle) over another, you can set that\n+    with the print_cyclic flag.\n+\n+    >>> Permutation(1, 2)(4, 5)(3, 4)\n+    Permutation([0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3])\n+    >>> p = _\n+\n+    >>> Permutation.print_cyclic = True\n+    >>> p\n+    (1 2)(3 4 5)\n+    >>> Permutation.print_cyclic = False\n+\n+    2) Regardless of the setting, a list of elements in the array for cyclic\n+    form can be obtained and either of those can be copied and supplied as\n+    the argument to Permutation:\n+\n+    >>> p.array_form\n+    [0, 2, 1, 4, 5, 3]\n+    >>> p.cyclic_form\n+    [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]\n+    >>> Permutation(_) == p\n+    True\n+\n+    3) Printing is economical in that as little as possible is printed while\n+    retaining all information about the size of the permutation:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n+    Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n+    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3], size=20)\n+    Permutation([1, 0], size=20)\n+    >>> Permutation([1, 0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6], size=20)\n+    Permutation([1, 0, 2, 4, 3], size=20)\n+\n+    >>> p = Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n+    >>> Permutation.print_cyclic = True\n+    >>> p\n+    (3)(0 1)\n+    >>> Permutation.print_cyclic = False\n+\n+    The 2 was not printed but it is still there as can be seen with the\n+    array_form and size methods:\n+\n+    >>> p.array_form\n+    [1, 0, 2, 3]\n+    >>> p.size\n+    4\n+\n+    Short introduction to other methods\n+    ===================================\n+\n+    The permutation can act as a bijective function, telling what element is\n+    located at a given position\n+\n+    >>> q = Permutation([5, 2, 3, 4, 1, 0])\n+    >>> q.array_form[1] # the hard way\n+    2\n+    >>> q(1) # the easy way\n+    2\n+    >>> {i: q(i) for i in range(q.size)} # showing the bijection\n+    {0: 5, 1: 2, 2: 3, 3: 4, 4: 1, 5: 0}\n+\n+    The full cyclic form (including singletons) can be obtained:\n+\n+    >>> p.full_cyclic_form\n+    [[0, 1], [2], [3]]\n+\n+    Any permutation can be factored into transpositions of pairs of elements:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]).transpositions()\n+    [(1, 2), (3, 5), (3, 4)]\n+    >>> Permutation.rmul(*[Permutation([ti], size=6) for ti in _]).cyclic_form\n+    [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]\n+\n+    The number of permutations on a set of n elements is given by n! and is\n+    called the cardinality.\n+\n+    >>> p.size\n+    4\n+    >>> p.cardinality\n+    24\n+\n+    A given permutation has a rank among all the possible permutations of the\n+    same elements, but what that rank is depends on how the permutations are\n+    enumerated. (There are a number of different methods of doing so.) The\n+    lexicographic rank is given by the rank method and this rank is used to\n+    increment a permutation with addition/subtraction:\n+\n+    >>> p.rank()\n+    6\n+    >>> p + 1\n+    Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\n+    >>> p.next_lex()\n+    Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\n+    >>> _.rank()\n+    7\n+    >>> p.unrank_lex(p.size, rank=7)\n+    Permutation([1, 0, 3, 2])\n+\n+    The product of two permutations p and q is defined as their composition as\n+    functions, (p*q)(i) = q(p(i)) [6]_.\n+\n+    >>> p = Permutation([1, 0, 2, 3])\n+    >>> q = Permutation([2, 3, 1, 0])\n+    >>> list(q*p)\n+    [2, 3, 0, 1]\n+    >>> list(p*q)\n+    [3, 2, 1, 0]\n+    >>> [q(p(i)) for i in range(p.size)]\n+    [3, 2, 1, 0]\n+\n+    The permutation can be 'applied' to any list-like object, not only\n+    Permutations:\n+\n+    >>> p(['zero', 'one', 'four', 'two'])\n+     ['one', 'zero', 'four', 'two']\n+    >>> p('zo42')\n+    ['o', 'z', '4', '2']\n+\n+    If you have a list of arbitrary elements, the corresponding permutation\n+    can be found with the from_sequence method:\n+\n+    >>> Permutation.from_sequence('SymPy')\n+    Permutation([1, 3, 2, 0, 4])\n+\n+    See Also\n+    ========\n+\n+    Cycle\n+\n+    References\n+    ==========\n+\n+    ..

Instead of constructing the permutation by applying cycles from left to right, it raises a `ValueError`. The desired behavior is to handle non-disjoint cycles by applying them sequentially and returning the resultant permutation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n- Identified code span IDs: [\"Permutation.__new__\", \"Permutation.list\"]\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Permutation.__new__**:\n  This method is responsible for constructing a new `Permutation` object from provided arguments. It contains logic to handle different kinds of input formats including disjoint cycles. This is relevant as the issue is about properly handling non-disjoint cycles in the constructor.\n  \n- **Permutation.list**:\n  This method returns the permutation in list form, possibly truncating unmoved elements. This method interacts with the `array_form` which is a key aspect that gets constructed in the `__new__` method. The patch affects the constructor of the `Permutation` class, and improved handling here could ensure the proper behavior of the `list` method as well.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

Checking if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is aiming to fix the correct function. The `__new__` method, relevant to the reported issue about non-disjoint cycles in `Permutation`, is where the modification happens. The correct method for handling constructor logic involving cycles and situations described is targeted here.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking if the patch introduces new issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn\u2019t introduce new issues directly. It modifies the `__new__` method in a way that inherently supports the additional non-disjoint cycles use case, in line with its purpose. Existing logic in cometoration with newly introduced one ensure compatibility and no crash.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nFrom initial evaluations, it looks like the patch properly addresses handling of non-disjoint cycles the `Permutation` constructor, turning the inputs cyclic representations translate properly to array forms. The correction isolated much to or outside norm operations except vertex in context and effectively changes.\n\nPossible edge case testing in different cycle/request size climates fay helps more absolutely.
