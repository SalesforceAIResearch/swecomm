These defects make the pretty-printed output look asymmetrical and bulkier than necessary.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_id_list>\nPrettyPrinter._print_Product\n</span_id_list>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span with ID `PrettyPrinter._print_Product` outlines the implementation of the pretty-printing of the `Product` class. This function is responsible for rendering the product notation correctly with the appropriate ASCII/Unicode characters, setting up the presentation of bounds, and organizing them vertically and horizontally. The logic inside this function directly impacts the final appearance of the pretty-printed product, making it highly relevant to the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n\n1. Modification in Line 493: `(func_height + 2) * 5 // 3 - 2` is changed to `(func_height + 2) * 3 // 2 - 2`. \n   - Reduces the width of the product's bounding box.\n\n2. Modification in Line 497: `for i in range(func_height + 1)` is changed to `for i in range(func_height)`.\n   - Eliminates unnecessary lines that contributed to the extra space.\n\n3.

However, the discovery that redundancy in creating placeholders at line 522, potentially leads to an unwanted repetition; `pretty_form(*pretty_sign.right(pretty_sign))` should most likely be affecting stack. It should be `pretty_form(*pretty_sign.right(pretty_func))` instead to maintain chaining of operations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the main issues detailed in the complaint:\n- It reduces the width, making the notation slimmer.\n- It removes unnecessary vertical lines, particularly the extra bottom row of empty lines.\nHowever, there's an inadvertent redundancy introduced in line 22/522 within pretty_sign chaining leading to error expected, fixing manipulation proper chaining logic likely bypasses.

Issue Fix Evaluation\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThough the patch is modifying the appropriate parts needing changes following some suggestions in the issue report, it missed out on extending the top bar and fixing width assymetry effectively. Additionally, it contains an editing mistake that overlays the changes. Thus, the patch is flawed and contains avoidable mistakes breaking intended calculations, and integrity.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"
