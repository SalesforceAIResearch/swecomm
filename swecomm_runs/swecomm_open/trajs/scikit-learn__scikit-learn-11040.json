Any metric from scikit-learn\n+        or scipy.spatial.distance can be used.\n+\n+        If metric is a callable function, it is called on each\n+        pair of instances (rows) and the resulting value recorded. The callable\n+        should take two arrays as input and return one value indicating the\n+        distance between them. This works for Scipy's metrics, but is less\n+        efficient than passing the metric name as a string.\n+\n+        Distance matrices are not supported.\n+\n+        Valid values for metric are:\n+\n+        - from scikit-learn: ['cityblock', 'cosine', 'euclidean', 'l1', 'l2',\n+          'manhattan']\n+\n+        - from scipy.spatial.distance: ['braycurtis', 'canberra', 'chebyshev',\n+          'correlation', 'dice', 'hamming', 'jaccard', 'kulsinski',\n+          'mahalanobis', 'minkowski', 'rogerstanimoto', 'russellrao',\n+          'seuclidean', 'sokalmichener', 'sokalsneath', 'sqeuclidean',\n+          'yule']\n+\n+        See the documentation for scipy.spatial.distance for details on these\n+        metrics.\n+\n+    p : integer, optional (default = 2)\n+        Parameter for the Minkowski metric from\n+        sklearn.metrics.pairwise.pairwise_distances.

The code currently throws a less informative error (`TypeError: 'float' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`). The expected behavior is to interrogate the type of `n_neighbors` earlier and either cast it to an integer or raise a more descriptive user-friendly error message if needed.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the `NearestNeighbors` estimator does not validate the type of the `n_neighbors` parameter, leading to a `TypeError` when a float is passed instead of an integer. This type should be checked earlier to provide a clearer error message or convert the float to an integer.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**List of span ids:**\n1. `NeighborsBase.__init__`\n2. `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`\n3. `NearestNeighbors`\n4. `NearestNeighbors.__init__`\n\n**Code spans relevance:**\n- **`NeighborsBase.__init__`:** This constructor in the base class sets up initial parameters, including `n_neighbors`. It's important to understand if and how validation might be passed down from here.\n- **`KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`:** This method handles the neighbor searching and accepts `n_neighbors`, making it critical to implement proper validation here to prevent erroneous processing.\n- **`NearestNeighbors`:** Defines the docstrings and general information for `NearestNeighbors`, establishing the constraints validations in its `__init__` method as it points to the class\u2019s overall documentation.\n- **`NearestNeighbors.__init__`:** Initializes `NearestNeighbors`. Validates the constructor parameters and handles the main logic that can impact the issue.\n  \n<code_span_exp>\n- `NeighborsBase.__init__`: Controls the initialization of neighbor-related parameters in the base class, involving `n_neighbors`.\n- `KNeighborsMixin.kneighbors`: Critical for validating and handling the `n_neighbors` parameter used in kneighbors method.\n- `NearestNeighbors`: Defines the settings and parameters explicitly for `NearestNeighbors`, including explanations in the docstring.\n- `NearestNeighbors.__init__`: Checks the initial values for parameters, including `n_neighbors`. Essential for incorporating the fix.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n1. Modification in `base.py` at handled docstring refined info and validation change setting `n_neighbors` to int if it\u2019s a float.\n2. Validation and instantiation addition in `unsupervised.py` with inclusion of the added hunk.\n\n**Patch Explanation**\n- **Hunk 1 (base.py):**\n  This hunk modified the docstring to allow `n_neighbors` as an optional integer or float. If passed as a float, it will convert `n_neighbors` into an integer.\n  \n    ```None\n    n_neighbors : int or float, optional (default=None)\n    Number of neighbors to get. If a float, it will be rounded to the nearest integer.\n    ```\n\n- **Hunk 2 (unsupervised.py original):**\n  This involves expanding the initialization method to include extra validation recently added raising an exception if `n_neighbors` isn\u2019t correctly an integer using instance checks making it a clearer Type definition Validator for `n_neighbors` type correctness setting
