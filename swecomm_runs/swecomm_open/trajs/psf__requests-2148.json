The patch does not appear to introduce contradictions within `models.py`. However, whether all other related areas (like verified HTTPS connections) would need similar patches isn't addressed, which could be necessary for consistency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check If the Patch Can Fix the Issue\nWe evaluate if the functionality added indeed resolves the issue without errors often propagated by LLMs such as minor syntactical inaccuracies, logical appeals or wrong function usage.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch logically addresses the immediate occurrence of `socket.error` by wrapping it into a `ConnectionError`. The method attempts to transform existing exceptions to consistent custom exceptions ensuring brevity. Introducing an import fix (`socket`) is correctly linked with changed logic. A point for careful review: all exceptions propagating from sockets across other models/functions must be consistently wrapped similarly, in venues beyond just the focused script/portion divergence solved by LLM gates. Unintended scope ceremony spans subtle divergences handled but cautiously necessity prescribed for extensive request latitudes adjustments.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\nFinally, based on correctness, consistency across settings scope determination, overall addressing fundamental necessity, and introduced fixes conformities scoring is thus determined.\n<score>8</score>"

Ensuring that socket errors are properly captured and re-raised as ConnectionError exceptions within this function helps encapsulate any network issues during the request execution phase.\n\n2. **ConnectionError**:\n   - This class defines a `ConnectionError` exception, indicating that a connection error should be reflected clearly in the library's available exceptions.\n\n3. **VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect**:\n   - Relevant because this part of the code deals with SSL/TLS handshake and verification processes, where connection issues may occur that would ideally be caught and managed by specific exceptions.\n\n4. **HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen**:\n   - Deals with making raw HTTP requests using a pool of connections. Enhancing this function to manage exceptions correctly helps ensure consistent treatment of network protocol anomalies.\n\n5. **ProtocolError**:\n   - Sets a base exception for protocol-level errors, which might overlap or need to interact with how ConnectionError is defined and managed.\n\n6. **impl**:\n   - Specifies that `ConnectionError` is an alias for `ProtocolError`, establishing that connection-related errors are treated under protocol errors, which has implications for how exceptions are raised and handled.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

Hunks for `requests/models.py`:\n   - The import statement adds the `socket` module and includes `ConnectionError` from local exceptions module.\n   - In the `RequestHooksMixin` class, updated import statement uses `collections.abc` for compatibility.\n   - The main part of the changes occurs in the `generate` function where a `socket.error` is explicitly caught and re-raised as a `ConnectionError` exception.\n\n3. Other significant changes:\n   - The code block accrues additional error handling specifically for `socket.error` encapsulated in an attempt-except block to raise `ConnectionError`, streamlining the propagation of such network issues.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct locations. The introduced `ConnectionError` class, its inclusions in import statements, and the handling of `socket.error` within the specified models accurately align with the context of network errors flowing through these modules.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are introduced directly. The patch carefully updates exception handling, enhancing compatibility and robustness without conflicting aspects.

Correct behavior here ensures mapping flows properly between lower-level exceptions and `requests`-level ones.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunks:\n- Original code:\n  ```python\n  ...\n  except socket.error as sockerr:\n      raise ConnectionError(sockerr, request=request)\n\n  except MaxRetryError as e:\n      raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)\n  ...\n  ```\n\n  Modified code after patch:\n  ```python\n  ...\n  except socket.error as sockerr:\n      raise ConnectionError(sockerr, request=request)\n\n  except (MaxRetryError, socket.error) as e:\n      raise ConnectionError(e, request=request)\n  ...\n  ```\n\nExplanation:\nThe patch adds handling of `socket.error` within the same exception block already handling `MaxRetryError`. This means that when either of these exceptions is raised, it gets caught and re-raised as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. The added tuple `(MaxRetryError, socket.error)` in line `except (MaxRetryError, socket.error) as e:` simplifies handling both instances with a single path of raising `ConnectionError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location. The changes are applied within the `HTTPAdapter.send` method, which is crucial for sending HTTP requests and handling associated exceptions. Properly capturing and wrapping `socket.error` here ensures consistent behavior across the request life cycle, making it the correct function to address the reported issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues. The modification is additive and integrates problem handling for `socket.error` without bringing conflicts based on the examined context within the relevant code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by ensuring `socket.error` is caught and re-raised as `requests.exceptions.ConnectionError`. This elevates the discovered connection errors within the overarching request call mechanism up to the `requests` level, providing the expected library-consistent connection handling the user was seeking. However, adding the handling of all socket.error both as 'sockerr' and 'e' is unusual since it captures other instances the block integrates `socket.error`. Still, within this dynamic examination base the adjustment increases reliability.\n\nPatch correctness and practical limitation weigh together after evaluation ratings confirm the patch administers the asked fix\u2014yes certain misinterpretings drop down though direct primary objectives safeguard.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

This span is relevant to how exceptions like `socket.error` can be captured and handled within the higher-level adapters.\n\n2. ConnectionError: This class defines a specific exception type used in the requests library for connection-related issues. The user expects a `ConnectionError` to be raised rather than a raw `socket.error`.\n\n3. VerifiedHTTPSConnection.connect: This method manages the process of establishing an HTTPS connection, which includes wrapping the socket. This span is related to managing low-level socket issues that might occur and need appropriate exception handling.\n\n4. HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen: This method deals with making HTTP requests and obtaining a response, performing tasks such as obtaining a connection from the pool. It\u2019s relevant because it handles the low-level request and connection operations where socket issues might need to be caught and raised as requests exceptions.\n\n5. ProtocolError: This is an existing exception class raised when something goes wrong mid-request/response, which is somewhat related to what happens in the user's issue but doesn\u2019t map directly to a `socket.error`.\n\n6. impl: This code span indicates the relationship between `ConnectionError` and `ProtocolError`, defining `ConnectionError` actually as `ProtocolError` in `urllib3`.

It's indirectly related because if a connection fails here, it might throw an error that needs to be handled.\n\n4. **HTTPConnectionPool.urlopen**: This is a low-level function to fetch a connection and perform an HTTP request. Handling `socket.error` here is critical as it's the underlying implementation leveraging sockets.\n\n5. **ProtocolError**: Defines the `ProtocolError` exception.

Understanding the Candidate Patch:\n**List of modified hunks:**\n1. Change in `adapters.py` to include `TimeoutError` with `socket.error`.\n2. Changes across various files for adopting `collections.abc` imports.\n\n<patch_exp>\n**First Modified Hunk in adapters.py:**\nThis hunk changes the exception handling logic by catching both `socket.error` and `TimeoutError` combined, then raises a `ConnectionError` in both cases.\n\n**Modified Hunk in cookies.py:**\nChanges import statement to `from collections import abc as collections`. This is aimed at modernizing imports for compatibility.\n\n**Modified Hunk in urllib3/_collections.py:**\nSimilar to `cookies.py`, it changes the import to `collections.abc`.\n\n**Modified Hunk in sessions.py:**\nChanges import to `collections.abc`.\n\n**Modified Hunk in structures.py:**\nAdopts `collections.abc` for imports of mutable mappings.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Checking If the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `send` method in the `HTTPAdapter` class within `adapters.py`. This is the correct place to handle and wrap `socket.error` exceptions in a `ConnectionError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Checking If the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe primary patch change introduces `TimeoutError` handling along with `socket.error`, which appears sensible. The modifications for `collections.abc` imports are for modernization and compatibility, which should not introduce issues as long as the Python version requires/supports it.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Checking If the Patch Can Fix the Issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch handles `socket.error` correctly by wrapping it in a `ConnectionError`, which directly addresses the stated issue. Including `TimeoutError` seems an overreach unless explicitly stated in the issue, so it should be scrutinized. No redundancy or missing pieces evident otherwise.\n\nCommon LLMPotential Mistakes:\n1. **Patch Width Syndrome:** Touching too many files \u2013 The majority of patches seem tailored for import modernization without functional relevance to the direct issue.\n2. **Inappropriate Exception Handling:** Adding `TimeoutError` should be clarified, else stick precisely to the issue context.\n3. **Syntactic Juicing without Impact:** Beyond the prime fix in `adapters.py`, scattered file alterations feel syntactically valid but extraneous.\n\nRecommendation: Remove unrelated `TimeoutError` and non-issue specific intrinsic import--\n\n\"\"\nlocal text change impacts unless documentation indicates essential compliance needs.\n\nX: Language feedback adopts necessary class handling exceptional annotations while extended features improvement verifying conformance validation debugging soft stress-point redundant class structure truncation.\"\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring:\n<score>7</score>"

However, wrapping both `socket.error` and `TimeoutError` together might not provide needed granularity for some users especially those who differentiate handling timeouts versus other socket-related issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is addressing the issue by catching the `socket.error` and raising it as `ConnectionError`. Including `TimeoutError` doesn\u2019t contradict but might dilute the alert solely targeted to resolve socket reset scenario highlighted in the reported issue. Generally, modifying other files for `collections.abc` imports isn't addressing the core issue, resulting in unnecessary refactor. The added timeout exception inclusion may mislead introspections when profiling for socket specific anomalies.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
