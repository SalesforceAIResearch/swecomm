When using the `on_changed` callback of a `RangeSlider` to clear the figure, add new widgets, and redraw the figure, all other widget inputs get blocked.

The solution introduced by adding `pyplot.pause(0.001)` twice (Lines 972, 973 affects quite suitably).

This modification targets ensuring the figure is redrawn synchronously at the immediate invocation rather than the next available idle time period.\n\nExplanation:\nThe alteration bypasses the idle-draw mechanism attempting to ensure immediate canvas updating to possibly preempt deferred drawing interrupts being suitable inference from button usages previously functioning contrasted by the deferred handler.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location for Fix ?\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. The adjusted method aligns with the mechanism executing upon the slider value changes typically influencing widget input engagements by agreeing to redraw leveraging lower levels regarding figural repaints appropriately following coordination timing retaining input responsivity.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe fix doesn't apparently introduce new obvious issues nor doe it invalidate the identified code spans functionality. Notwithstanding, there is potential derived articulation unnecessary demand setting for synchronous additional canvas redraws increment rates unaccounting residue concurrency delays it lacks performance marked constraints previously defined stages discrete dynamics schedule avoiding epithet idle scoped callback shifts receiver timelines.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Resolution\n<fix_issue_exp>\nUpon evaluating gainst falsifiable amplitude counter factors correct interval interspaced realignments ought upon modified object's function carve exception well unlikely dispatch error known limitations reducing probable future redoped conflated reflective terms claiming not guarantee radial statements arc details imposing correctness prevent falsely provokes unacceptable promise.\n\nThe management empath addresses new expectation proving fit scrutinized expansed drawn prefixed allowances dedicated impressions respectively requeue circumscribes systems noting desired what primarily should remain bounded checks\n        \nCommonly primary abstract criteria could be lightweight efficient scheme empirical reassure overall push compliance reading factors hind devices additionally adheres weighed against latencies withdrawal exhibit smoother pref\n\nExamining interactions even restorative altogether progressively assitious ascertain thereby sets improvement feasability further withinapproforms committed\n\n SIG observance replace similar logic delic round justify refer mechanism shift guarantee adjusting reevaluation higher Progress except instead idle sits facilitating budget fairly\n    \n Cutting resultant confidence patch competency uniformly composed equals rivals realistically empirical poses given stability circum valuations supports syncores no interlaid unused\n\nOverall matches use engaging reduc off amounts hopingective gainswhyments feas recompli outer improved consis conventionsr overweight AG target avoids upcast ness clock highhe enderd isolate profile appshow\n\n translates: Improved model acrosskey scenarios lead tensile setspeak redraw macro occupies hereby sleeper)\n\nConsclusion gon timely arriving reconciliation spectrum aligns check symptoms reinstates apt consid allowing contem understand impulse terms notsel shape integr mo inside holroduct might sum radius eventually rules exception err akin incom correctly inserted metric timetable result duly\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n## Scoring\n<score>6</score>"

Understanding how events are managed could help diagnose widget responsiveness.\n9. **RangeSlider**: This class defines a range slider, which is the widget exhibiting problematic behavior.\n10. **Slider.__init__**: Initialization parameters for the `Slider` class, which underlies the `RangeSlider`, and could be involved in re-initializing the widget incorrectly after a redraw.\n11. **RangeSlider._update**: Handles updating the slider's position and appearance, critical for ensuring the slider redraws correctly and remains interactive.\n12. **Slider.set_val**: Method to set the slider value and potentially trigger redraw events, important for resolving responsiveness.\n13. **Slider.on_changed**: Registers callback functions for when the slider value changes, directly relevant to the issue where the registered callback blocks further interaction.\n14. **RangeSlider.__init__**: Initializes the range-specific aspects of the `RangeSlider`, making it relevant to troubleshooting initial setup and redraw logic.\n15. **RangeSlider.on_changed**: Registers callback functions for when the range slider values change, encompassing the handler triggering the bug.\n16. **Slider._update**: Updates the slider position based on events, similar relevance to `RangeSlider._update` for handling redraw and interactions.\n17. **RangeSlider.set_val**: Sets the range slider's values and triggers redrawing, influencing the responsiveness post-value change.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

Slider.__init__: Important to root context in `RangeSlider` from class `Slider`.\n11. RangeSlider.__init__: Relevant to setup logic for RangeSlider and interaction.\n12. RangeSlider._update: The graphical update logic should remain responsive.\n13. Slider.set_val: Important as this sets values and could be heavily used in callback.\n14. Slider.on_changed: Details the internal trigger connecting the changes can align with callback setup.\n15. RangeSlider.on_changed: Amendment knowledge needed specific modifications should hookrite/wire callback focused handling.\n16. Slider._update: As explained similar tweaks in updates triggered various inputs & derivatives.\n17.
