The expression `\\\\frac{\\\\frac{a^3+b}{c}}{\\\\frac{1}{c^2}}` should be parsed as `((a**3 + b)/c)/(1/(c**2))`, but instead, it yields `((a**3 + b)/c)/1/(c**2)`. The problem results from missing parentheses around the denominator, which changes the mathematical expression.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe parsing mechanism for LaTeX fractions in `sympy` does not correctly handle expressions with nested fractions, leading to incorrect mathematical results.

While the modification seems quite straightforward, it ensures that any expressions converted in the fraction's numerator and denominator don't get misinterpreted post parsing. Nonetheless, a comprehensive test should corroborate its success, but fundamentally, it addresses the described symptom correctly.\n\nOne potential common mistake is changes that might affect nested fractions handling, but this patch strategically continues to use `evaluate=False`, mitigating such a concern.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
