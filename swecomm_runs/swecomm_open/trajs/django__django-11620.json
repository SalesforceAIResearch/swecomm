Code block starting from line 81 in `django/core/handlers/exception.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. This modified hunk adds a conditional block in the `else` clause of the exception handler to specifically catch `Http404` exceptions when `DEBUG` is `True`. If the condition is met, it invokes `debug.technical_404_response(request, exc)` to generate a detailed technical 404 response instead of proceeding to handle uncaught exceptions generically.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct location. By placing the condition in the `response_for_exception`, which is the central place for generating exception responses, it ensures that no matter where `Http404` is raised, an appropriate response is generated when `DEBUG` is `True`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues. The condition added checks for `Http404` and `DEBUG` settings and branches accordingly to provide the desired 404 detailed response instead of using the generic uncaught exception handler.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch can indeed fix the issue as raised. Moving the technical 404 response generation to be directly in response to an `Http404` exception within `response_for_exception` ensures that a more detailed error page is presented when `DEBUG` is `True`. This is consistent with how other exceptions (like `PermissionDenied` or `SuspiciousOperation`) are treated based on the `DEBUG` status. Common LLM mistakes such as modifying the wrong method or introducing syntax errors are not present here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

It logs responses with status codes 400 or higher.\n- `response_for_exception`: This function defines how different types of exceptions, like `Http404`, are handled, specifically returning a debug response when `DEBUG` is `True`.\n- `URLResolver.resolve`: This function resolves URL paths to their respective callback functions. It raises `Resolver404` when it fails to match the path, enlightening how path resolution exceptions are handled.\n- `technical_404_response`: This function is used to craft a detailed debug 404 error response when `Http404` is raised and the `DEBUG` setting is enabled, providing a useful error page instead of a generic one.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\nCurate a list of modified hunks:\n- Converted the `to_python` method in `UUIDConverter` to raise an `Http404` with a detailed message on catching a `ValueError`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The modified hunk changes the `to_python` method in `UUIDConverter` to handle `ValueError` exceptions by raising an `Http404` with a detailed error message indicating an invalid UUID format.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is applied to the correct function (`to_python` method in `UUIDConverter`). This is the exact place where a `ValueError` is expected when converting a parameter to UUID, which should appropriately raise an `Http404` to halt processing and trigger the correct error handler.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe introduced patch generally aligns well with the error propagation framework observed in the code spans. Given that catching a `ValueError` and transforming it into a `Http404` is adding granularity to debugging responses, it doesn't introduce contradictions but supports better error tracking in debug mode.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check If the Patch Can Fix The Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to address the issue directly where the path conversion fails and changes the bare `ValueError` into a well-defined `Http404` exception. The raised `Http404` will then be handled by the framework to provide a detailed response if the `DEBUG` setting is enabled. The patch successfully negates the generic error message by amending a core part of the error flow. This approach falls in line with the user's requirement of giving informative error details when encountering conversion failures.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Instead, a server error message appears. This situation is confusing because an `Http404` exception should ideally provide a helpful error message indicating that the parameter value does not match any existing path.\n</issue_exp>\n\n**Step 2: Understand the identified code spans**\n\nList of span ids:\n- BaseHandler.get_response\n- response_for_exception\n- URLResolver.resolve\n- technical_404_response\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `BaseHandler.get_response`: This function handles HTTP requests and calls middleware and the main Django process chain to get the response. If the response status code is 404, this should be logged appropriately.\n\n- `response_for_exception`: This function generates the appropriate HTTP response for a given exception. For `Http404` exceptions, it calls `debug.technical_404_response` to provide detailed debugging information when `DEBUG` setting is `True`.\n\n- `URLResolver.resolve`: This method tries to resolve the URL pattern matched and invokes the respective view. When a `Resolver404` exception is raised, the error information is collected and propagated.\n\n- `technical_404_response`: This function constructs a detailed `404 Not Found` response with debugging information when handling an `Http404` exception.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Step 3: Understand the candidate patch**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. hunk modifying `URLResolver.resolve` method (urls/resolvers.py)\n2. hunk updating technical 404 functionality in a debug utility (views/debug.py)\n3. hunk updating the views/debug method (views/debug.py)\n4. overall structural updates including additional test cases (tests/urlpatterns/test_http404_handling.py)\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first hunk modifies `URLResolver.resolve` method:\n   - Adds an `except Http404 as e` clause.\n   - Appends the pattern to `tried` list and raises a `Resolver404` including the previous path and error message.\n   \n2. The second hunk modifies `views/debug.py`:\n   - It now attempts exe[]tract error_message from the args of Http404 exception along extending urls tried lists followed with rendering the HTML response template.\n   \n3. The third hunk modifies/fixes rendering issue around the 'reason' field of template context.\n   \n4. New Tests added in `tests/urlpatterns/test_http404_handling.py`:\n   The tests aim to simulate the 404 behavior for a custom converter by registering `${CustomConverter}` with converter chain and executes a few tests validating HTTP cadre behavior in DEBUGress Outs object and confirming `404 Error Page Not Found Wordage`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n**Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modifications are in `URLResolver.resolve` and `technical_404_response` functions and adding relevant error messages and appending as necessary helping propagate the errors appropriately for detection during debug.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n**Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere don't appear to be any new issues introduced.
