Since the issue specifically involves a `cosh` expression, fixes would likely be within this class.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n**Modified Hunks:**\n- Add import statement for `count_ops`\n- Add a recursion depth check using `count_ops` inside `_eval_expand_trig` method\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk 1:\n- Adds the import statement `from sympy.core.function import count_ops`.\n  * This utility will be used to check the complexity of arguments to `cosh`.\n\nHunk 2:\n- Adds a check within `_eval_expand_trig` method to use `count_ops` for argument complexity.\n  * `if count_ops(arg) > 100:`\n  * If the complexity exceeds a defined threshold (here, arbitrarily set to 100), it returns the `cosh` of the argument directly, aiming to avoid deep recursion.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_eval_expand_trig` method within the `cosh` class, which is directly involved with expansions of arguments that can lead to deep recursions.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch seems to address the issue by preventing deep recursion, but doesn't contradict identified code spans. However, the arbitrary threshold of 100 for `count_ops` might be considered non-ideal, as it may cap expansions prematurely or insufficiently for large but manageable expressions. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch mitigates the deep recursion by using `count_ops` threshold. It prevents the recursion depth error for sufficiently complex expressions acting as a safeguard. While the chosen threshold is arbitrary and may need tuning, it resolves the immediate recursion depth issue highlighted.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring\nConsidering that:\n- The patch correctly addresses the location and the recursion depth issue.\n- It introduces a new mechanism albeit with an arbitrary choice, but no significant new issues were introduced.\n\n<score>7</score>\n"

Added a check `if count_ops(arg) > 100: return cosh(arg)` to avoid deep recursion.\n\n**Explanation:**\n<patch_exp>\n1. `from sympy.core.function import count_ops` - This import allows the `count_ops` function to be used, providing a way to count the operations in an expression.\n2. Adding `if count_ops(arg) > 100: return cosh(arg)` - This prevents deep recursion by skipping the full expansion logic when the number of operations in the argument exceeds 100, returning the `cosh(arg)` directly instead.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Correct location check.\n\n**Explanation:**\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `_eval_expand_trig` method within the `cosh` class, affecting how deep expansions are handled. Since `_eval_expand_trig` is likely the method involved in triggering the recursion error, this is the correct location for addressing the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. New issues check.\n\n**Explanation:**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch prevents deep recursion by returning early for complex expressions with more than 100 operations. However, setting an arbitrary value of 100 without substantial justification could potentially skip legitimate expansions for complex but manageable expressions in other scenarios. While functional, this threshold could introduce issues where desired expansions are curtailed.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Patch effectiveness check.\n\n**Explanation:**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to address the described recursion problem by restricting the depth of expression expansion based on the number of operations. Although it might prevent the error in some cases, potential issues include the setting of an arbitrary operations threshold that could skip necessary expansions. Additionally, the hardcoded value solution has inherent inflexibility and less robustness across varying use cases.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n**Score:**\n<score>6</score>"

This problem occurs specifically with complex nested expressions evaluated in `SymPy`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThis issue causes a `RecursionError` when checking if the hyperbolic cosine expression is zero. The expression given is a complex function: `cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i)))`. Calling the `is_zero` attribute on this expression results in a maximum recursion depth error.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n**List of span ids:**\n1. Expr\n2. cosh\n\n**Code Span Relevance:**\n1. **Expr (`sympy/core/expr.py`):**\n   - This code span defines the base class for algebraic expressions (`Expr`) in SymPy. The `is_zero` check that invokes the depth recursion likely originates here as this class deals with arithmetic operations and comparisons.\n\n2. **cosh (`sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`):**\n   - This code span defines the `cosh` class, which represents the hyperbolic cosine function. The problem expression uses `cosh`, which ties to this span of code since any methods (like `is_zero`) would be attributes/methods on this class.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Expr**: This class handles basic algebraic expressions including comparisons which include checks for zero values potentially propagating the recursion via operations defined here.\n- **cosh**: This class implements the hyperbolic cosine function relevant to the issue as the problematic expression involves evaluating a `cosh` function.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n1. Converting identity check (`is`) to equality check (`==`) in the `functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` file.\n\n**Hunk Explanation:**\n\nOriginal Code:\n<before_patch>\n```python\nelif arg.is_zero:\n    return S.Zero\n```\n</before_patch>\n\nPatched Code:\n<after_patch>\n```python\nelif arg == S.Zero:\n    return S.Zero\n```\n</after_patch>\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The patched code alters the condition that checks if the argument `arg` equals zero. It changes from using an identity check (`is_zero`) to an equality check (`== S.Zero`). This change aims to mitigate infinite recursion that could stem from the deep evaluation of nested expressions invoking `is_zero`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Modifies the zero comparison check from `is_zero` to direct equality `(== S.Zero)` to prevent `RecursionError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Function Location Check\n\n**Check: Correct Location**\n- The patch is introduced in `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py`, which is part of evaluating hyperbolic functions like `cosh`. Since the issue is about recursive check of zero in cosh, modifying this part of `cosh` function is logically correspondent to the issue.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies code in the correct location. `sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py` is relevant because it deals with the `cosh` function that's mentioned in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n   \n- Contrary changes or conflicts with initial code spans are not seen.\n- However, ensuring that the equality comparison directly modifies no implied states or behaviors due to turning identity checks to equality checks needs verification but shows no immediate red flag.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues, nor contradict identified code spans succinctly. Changing from `is` to `==` is potentially an apt logical fix targeting expression evaluation consistency and should not contradict previous behaviors functionally but utmost validation is essential.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Patch Effectiveness in Fixing the Issue\n\n- **Increasing robustness**: Changing from `is_zero` to a straightforward equality check can preempt potential recursive invocations which exacts transpired the recursion depth limit originally.\n- **Standard approach**: Switching from a specialized `is_zero` likely to be traversing expression trees to simple direct equality deemed a robust shortcut actuaritically and logically aligns constructily in mitigating the error. This should underpin ritual code redflags pertaining calculations.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue by simplifying what causes the recursion- exploiting native equality versus extensive attribute checks but necessitates comprehensive testing to totally rule out overlooked inconsistencies including exiges expression reevaluation dynamic conflicts initially anticipated in `Expr class`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

                    "msg": "### Step 1: Understand the Issue\nThe issue is related to a bug that triggers a `RecursionError: maximum recursion depth exceeded while calling a Python object` when evaluating if a mathematical expression, involving hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions, is zero using SymPy.\n\nExample: \n```python\nexpr = sympify(\"cosh(acos(-i + acosh(-g + i))\")\nexpr.is_zero\n```\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe reported issue causes the program to hit Python's maximum recursion depth limit while checking if a specific combination of hyperbolic and inverse hyperbolic functions evaluates to zero using SymPy.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nList of identified code span IDs: [Expr, cosh]\n\n#### Code Span Exp Explanation:\n1. **Expr Class (sympy/core/expr.py)**\n   - **File Path**: sympy/core/expr.py\n   - **Lines**: 18-44\n   - **Explanation**: `Expr` is the base class for algebraic expressions in SymPy. Its importance lies in that any arithmetic manipulations done on expressions in SymPy, such as checking if an expression is zero, are derived from this class.\n\n2. **cosh Class (sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py)**\n   - **File Path**: sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py\n   - **Lines**: 273-291\n   - **Explanation**: The `cosh` class represents the hyperbolic cosine function in SymPy. The issue pertains to evaluating whether complex mathematical functions, like those involving `cosh`, evaluate to zero, hence making this code span relevant.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Expr Class (sympy/core/expr.py) is relevant because it underpins algebraic expressions, including arithmetic operations which SymPy uses to evaluate conditions like `is_zero`.\n2. cosh Class (sympy/functions/elementary/hyperbolic.py) is relevant because the issue specifically involves the `cosh` function within a complex expression.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n#### Hunk & Patch Explanation:\n\n1. **Hunk 1 \u2013 New Helper Function to Handle Recursion**:\n   - The patch introduces a new function called `debug_is_zero` in a newly created file `reproduce_bug.py`.\n   - The key additions include:\n     - Depth limiting mechanism to prevent potential infinite recursion (`if depth > 50...`).\n     - Conditional checks for methods related to zero evaluation (`_eval_is_zero`).\n     - Utilization of recursion to inspect arguments of the expression.\n   - **File Path**: b/reproduce_bug.py\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch introduces a new file `reproduce_bug.py`, which contains a helper function `debug_is_zero` to safely check if an expression is zero by inspecting the expression and potentially its subcomponents, while also enforcing a depth limit to preclude hitting Python\u2019s recursion limit. Additionally, it utilizes existing internal SymPy methods and handles recursion more gracefully.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\nThe issue pertains to recursion depth issues within the SymPy library when dealing with complex expressions. To that end, the LLM patch correctly places a recursion mitigation check and introspection mechanism within the evaluation function relevant to these Expressions, which aligns with both the Expr class's requirement and expressions involving trigonometric functions like cosh.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch places corrective measures and recursion handling in the function responsible, aligning with the requirements drawn from Expr and expressions involving `cosh`, making it suitable to debug the actual evaluation process.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues or Contradictions\nTL;DR: Evaluates if methods described in identified code spans are aligned with new helpers. Contradictions exist:\n- Not fully integrated into underlying classes might leave issue partially unresolved beyond this purpose.\n- The original approach disconnects boolean trace evaluations and method inclusion e.g., _eval_is_zero, implying independent handling without modifying Span behaviors internally.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces more complexity but does not fully integrate the resolution in key fundamentals by leveraging utility functions.
