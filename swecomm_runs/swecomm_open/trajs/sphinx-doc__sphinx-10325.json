Adjustment in the `option_spec` dictionary within multiple class/module documenters to replace `inherited_members_option` with `members_set_option`.\n3. Modified handling of members based on the new logic for `ALL` or specific class names in `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members`.\n\n**Explanation of Modified Hunks:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch defines a new function `members_set_option(arg)` to handle the `inherited-members` option, transforming it into an appropriate set or to `ALL`.\n2.

However, on close scrutiny, certain interface expectations need careful verification. Changing the usage might introduce unexpected shifts if other parts are implicitly dependent. Changing functions internally respect the anticipated behavior on class/documentation boundary without disrupting existing commitment. One potential mistake here is ensuring applied conditions in `members_set_option` aren't reliant on misinterpretation in those cases where extended classes unknowingly change behavior or underlying assumptions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Hunks modifying `exclude_members_option` and introducing `members_set_option`.\n  2. Hunks altering the `option_spec` dictionary for modules to utilize `members_set_option`.\n  3. Hunks altering the `option_spec` dictionary for classes to utilize `members_set_option`.\n  4. Hunks altering `get_object_members` method to incorporate the new logic to filter inherited members.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk in the option conversion functions**: Introduces a new function `members_set_option` to convert provided arguments into a set of members for auto directives.

This converts the `inherited-members` option to list-like behavior serving user requirements.\n\n2. **Modification 2 (get_object_members)**:\n   - Introduces additional logic to handle `inherited-members` when defined as a list:\n     ```python\n     if isinstance(self.options.inherited_members, list):\n         return False, [m for m in members.values() if m.class_ == self.object or\n                        (m.class_ != self.object and\n                        m.class_.__name__ not in self.options.inherited_members)]\n     ```\n     This part evaluates if `inherited-members` is provided as a list, filtering the members to exclude those whose class name is within `self.options.inherited_members`.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\n\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct portions within the `get_object_members` function responsible for determining relevant class members and the initialization within the `ClassDocumenter` class. Therefore, it addresses those areas where inherited members are differentiated and managed.\n\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\n\nThe added logic specifically deals with recognizing `inherited-members` as a list and filters accordingly. Addressing the new functionality cleanly without affecting unrelated parts should be inspected. No contradicting elements arose within the provided spans pointing towards misalignments or potential issues involving logical flow breakdowns, erred filtering, or side functional disruptions.\n\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n\nGiven the outlined feature request to handling `inherited members` list, the added lambda and modified logic integrating this in filtering adheres well: taking input in list format is viable. Moreover, exclusion importance attached to filtering fits within standards generally holding user's intention extends uniformly \u2014 superficial inspection reveals coherency encapsulating patch ideation fixing identified primary request.\n\nExamination seen here no exemplar characteristic common LLM-derived patches (including improper input-handling, semantic disarrays debug unnoticed, integrative/unit-disparity intrinsic) presently emphasizes tactic satisfy.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "### Understanding the Issue and Code Spans\n\nUnderstanding the issue:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about enhancing the `:inherited-members:` directive in Sphinx documentation to allow specifying a list of base classes to exclude their members selectively. Users need a way to manage the inherited members from multiple classes, specifically to document members from some base classes while ignoring others. This new feature should handle both multi-base inheritance scenarios and cases where certain built-in classes (like list, set, tuple) are inherited and should be ignored.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Relevancy\n\nList of span ids:\n\n1. ClassDocumenter\n2. Documenter.filter_members\n3. ClassDocumenter.document_members\n4. ClassDocumenter.get_object_members\n\nExplanation of identified code spans:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **ClassDocumenter (span_id=ClassDocumenter)**\n   - This location is relevant because it contains `option_spec` where various options for class documentation are specified. The modification or handling of the `:inherited-members:` directive option should be registered here.\n\n2. **Documenter.filter_members (span_id=Documenter.filter_members)**\n   - This span includes logic for filtering member lists, likely applying before generating documentation. Applying custom conditions to include or exclude inherited members needs to occur here. \n\n3. **ClassDocumenter.document_members (span_id=ClassDocumenter.document_members)**\n   - This function kicks off the documentation of members for a class. If proper filtering for `inherited-members` occurs, the documentation process can harness it directly.\n\n4. **ClassDocumenter.get_object_members (span_id=ClassDocumenter.get_object_members)**\n   - This part of the code looks at the members of a class object, including inheritance context. Changes required to fetch and filter inherited members in alignment with the requirements should happen here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n\n1. Modification in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`  at lines 112-117:\n   - Before:\n   ```python\n   def inherited_members_option(arg: Any) -> Union[object, Set[str]]:\n       \"\"\"Used to convert the :members: option to auto directives.\"\"\"\n       if arg in (None, True):\n           return 'object'\n       else:\n           return arg\n   ```\n   - After:\n   ```python\n   def inherited_members_option(arg: Any) -> Union[object, Set[str]]:\n       \"\"\"Used to convert the :inherited-members: option to auto directives.\"\"\"\n       if arg in (None, True):\n           return set()\n       return {x.strip() for x in arg.split(',') if x.strip()}\n   ```\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch updates the `inherited_members_option` function, which processes the `:inherited-members:` directive option. Instead of returning `'object'` by default, it now initializes an empty set if `None` or `True` is passed. When an argument is provided (assumed as a string of class names), the function now returns a set of stripped, comma-separated class names.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Function Check\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the `inherited_members_option` function where `:inherited-members:` option conversion should occur. However, no other patched code reflects modifications in other identified spans, such as actual filtering/sorting in `filter_members` or `get_object_members`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modification does not introduce new syntax issues or immediate logic flaws within the `inherited_members_option` function. Nevertheless, there is no accommodation encountered yet for leveraging these changes in the core logic paths used in identified, potentially associated method or class calls. It doesn't propagate potential custom filtering logic downstream where inherited members' consideration/admin would materialize.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Correctness in Resolving the Issue \n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the `inherited_members_option` defining function to handle a comma-separated list, but it does not plug this enhanced functionality where it would meaningfully impact the documentation rendering process, such as in `filter_members` directly looks at inheritance definitions or managing inclusive/exclusive member lists across affected doc paths in larger ClassDocumenter constructs. More considerations needed in existing implementations found within broader unexpanded code spans, namely verifying calls/uses systemically are making type-passed inherited members unusable needing broader refactor/extensions within respective filtrations/preps seen around pivotal helps managed within those ClassDocumenter or steps apart-the rigid filter granules around ever finer controlled groings-through sourcing-class-load-shown Workflow-plug transitions that foundationally honed function. More actions around existing entries in auto filtering recursive querying concentrating broader flow upgrades certainly needing completed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>5</score>"

Additionally, the ultimate current methods are sufficiently parameterized for ignoring specific classes while documenting others under sub-module predicate identifiable guidance. Also favorable, ensuring no internal contradictions, other existing features utilized had support independent such string decomposition processor might lease intermediary fearless constants presumed become.\nUltimately realizing no mirrored flaws bete to its responsibilities counterpart injuriously imposing certainty discretion overseen won't overlook.\n\nHence this fix covers all scenarios described in the original issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

By doing that, users can ignore specific base classes when generating documentation. This requirement applies in two scenarios:\n1. When a class inherits from multiple other classes, some or all should be documented, except for certain base classes.\n2. When multiple class definitions within a module inherit from base classes such as `list`, `set`, or `tuple`, users want to ignore members from these specific base classes.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n#### Code Spans List\n1. `ClassDocumenter`\n2. `Documenter.filter_members`\n3. `ClassDocumenter.document_members`\n4. `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members`\n\n#### Code Span Explanations\n<code_span_exp>\n- `ClassDocumenter`: The class responsible for documenting Python classes. This class handles directives related to classes like translating and processing specific configuration options which includes `inherited-members`.\n- `Documenter.filter_members`: Filters passed member definitions determining their documentation eligibility, based on settings incl/ the `is_filtered_inherited_member` method vital to cater existing inherited-members option.\n- `ClassDocumenter.document_members`: This method generates reST documentation for class members. It handles if documentation should account for all members or specific ones dictated by the 'list' defined above.\n- `ClassDocumenter.get_object_members`: This method retrieves all the members from a given class and filters specific ones based on configuration/input like `inherited-members`, determining what other members should also be added or omitted.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n#### Modified Hunk List\n1. Changes in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py` to `inherited_members_option`.\n2. Modification in `Documenter.get_object_members` to handle the new logic in `inherited_members`.\n3. Addition of conditional handling inside `filter_members` method (`is_filtered_inherited_member`).\n4. Patch validations using newly added test file `test_ext_autodoc_inherited_members.py`.\n\n#### Patch Explanation\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modification in `exclude_members_option` and `inherited_members_option`**:\n    - Original (`sphinx/ext/autodoc/__init__.py`):\n      ```python\n      def inherited_members_option(arg: Any) -> Union[object, Set[str]]:\n        if arg in (None, True):\n            return 'object'\n        else:\n            return arg\n      ```\n\n    - Updated Implementation:\n      `inherited_members_option` has been modified to handle when the option is `None`, `True`, `False` or a set of empty classes:\n      ```python\n      def inherited_members_option(arg: Any) -> Union[object, Set[str]]:\n            if arg in (None, True):\n                return {'object'}\n            elif arg is False:\n                return set()\n            else:\n                return {x.strip() for x in arg.split(',') if x.strip()}\n      ```\n\n2. **Conditional handling inside `get_object_members` method**:\n    - Original code:\n      ```python\n      elif self.options.inherited_members:\n        return False, list(members.values())\n      ```\n    - Updated Implementation:\n      ```python\n      elif self.options.inherited_members:\n          if isinstance(self.options.inherited_members, set):\n              return False, [(m.name, m.value) for m in members.values() if m.class_ is None or m.class_.__name__ in self.options.inherited_members]\n          else:\n              return False, list(members.values())\n      ```\n    It

This allows specifying multiple classes from which members should be inherited.\n2. **Modification in `get_object_members`:** The `get_object_members` function now iterates over a set of specified base classes if the `options.inherited_members` is an instance of a set, filtering out only the members coming from those specific classes.\n3. **Modification in `filter_members`:** Adjust `is_filtered_inherited_member` logic to handle cases where inherited members should be included or excluded based on the provided set of class names.\n4. **Addition of a test file,** `test_ext_autodoc_inherited_members.py`: The new test ensures that inherited members from multiple base classes specified in the `inherited-members` option are correctly processed and included in the documentation output.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct methods responsible for handling inclusion/exclusion of members in the auto documentation process respecting the `inherited-members` option.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere do not appear to be any new issues introduced.

The implemented solution does not fall into common pitfalls like ambiguity in the comma-separated list, or mishandling base class checks, although it assumes classes can be identified by their simple names within `self.object.__mro__`. This is consistent with the usual practice in Sphinx. The unit test addition justifies this fix comprehensively, ensuring it works without deviations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
