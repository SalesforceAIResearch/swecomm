It already uses an `error_class` called `nonfield` which is closely related to what needs to be done in the FormSet context for non-form errors.\n- BaseFormSet.non_form_errors: This method returns an `ErrorList` of errors not linked to a particular form in a FormSet. This is the method where the patch proposes to include the new error_class `nonform`.\n- BaseFormSet.full_clean: This method populates `_errors` and `_non_form_errors` in a formset.

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about adding a `nonform` CSS class to non-form errors in Django `FormSet` instances. Currently, Django forms have a `nonfield` CSS class for non-field errors (errors not associated with any particular field). However, `FormSets` (which are collections of forms) do not have a similar class for their non-form errors, making it hard to distinguish these when rendering error messages. Adding this class helps in styling and identification of these errors.\n</issue_exp>\n\nSPAN IDs:\n- BaseForm.non_field_errors\n- BaseFormSet.non_form_errors\n- BaseFormSet.full_clean\n- BaseFormSet\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **BaseForm.non_field_errors**: This function defines how non-field errors (errors not associated with a specific form field) are represented in the base form. It is relevant because it demonstrates the approach for handling non-field errors, which is analogous to the non-form errors for FormSets.\n\n- **BaseFormSet.non_form_errors**: This is the endpoint to retrieve non-form errors for a FormSet. The added CSS class needs to be implemented here so that non-form errors can be returned with the appropriate styling class.\n\n- **BaseFormSet.full_clean**: This function is responsible for populating the `_non_form_errors` attribute in a FormSet. It needs modification to ensure that the `_non_form_errors` are compatible with the new CSS class since it generates the list of non-form errors.\n\n- **BaseFormSet**: This entire class encapsulates the FormSet logic. The change needs to be implemented within this class to maintain encapsulation and respect the class design.\n</code_span_exp>\n\nModified Hunks:\n1. Modified `BaseFormSet` docstring and added `nonform_error_class` attribute.\n2. Updated `non_form_errors` method to include `'nonform'` CSS class.\n3. Added new test case for `nonform` CSS class handling in non-form errors.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified `BaseFormSet` docstring and added `nonform_error_class` attribute**:\n   - Docstring now mentions the new feature for non-form errors and their `nonform` CSS class.\n   - Initialized a new attribute `nonform_error_class` to store the class name for non-form errors.\n\n2. **Updated `non_form_errors` method**:\n   - Changed the `non_form_errors` method to include the `nonform` CSS class when returning non-form errors. This ensures that non-form errors are returned with the CSS class specified by the `nonform_error_class` attribute.\n\n3. **Added new test case**:\n   - Added a test in a new file `test_formset_nonform_errors.py` to ensure non-form errors get the correct CSS class.\n   - This test case generates a non-form error and checks if the rendered errors have the `class=\"nonform\"` attribute.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modification is made within the `BaseFormSet` class, specifically in its `non_form_errors` method and `_non_form_errors` handling in `full_clean`. Changes are also encapsulated properly within the `BaseFormSet`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues. It correctly extends the `ErrorList` generation to include a CSS class for non-form errors without altering existing behaviors elsewhere in the formset code. There\u2019s no contradiction with identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the reported issue by introducing the `nonform` CSS class for non-form errors in formsets. It follows the structural analogy seen in `Form` with respect to `non_field_errors`. The common improvements patches make are overwritten by a properly encapsulated fix that does not interfere with other functionalities. However, the common mistake here is ensuring method compatibility with any customized `ErrorList`. It appears robust, assuming `error_class` remains a compatible class.\n\nThere seem to be no pattern mistakes typical of automatic fixes provided by LLMs, such as overlooks on initializing attributes, incorrect property returns, uninitiated class references, etc. This solution is apt as per the issue raised and typical critical design patterns.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about lacking a 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets, which limits the ability to differentiate between form field errors, non-field errors (from forms), and non-form errors (from FormSets) when styling error messages. The suggestion is to add the 'nonform' CSS class for non-form errors in FormSets and document it accordingly.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nBaseForm.non_field_errors, BaseFormSet.non_form_errors, BaseFormSet.full_clean, BaseFormSet\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `BaseForm.non_field_errors`: This method handles the return of non-field errors from Form instances. It provides context on how non-field errors are currently managed with a distinct CSS class `'nonfield'`.\n\n2. `BaseFormSet.non_form_errors`: This is the key method where non-form errors for FormSets should be returned. Thus, it directly pertains to the patch requirement to add the 'nonform' CSS class.\n\n3. `BaseFormSet.full_clean`: This method performs comprehensive cleaning for formset data, identifying and accumulating formset-wide errors, thus initializing `_non_form_errors`.\n\n4. `BaseFormSet`: This class is central to formsets, aggregating form instances and their associated errors. Modifying it to include new behavior, like adding a specific CSS class for non-form errors, fits within its responsibilities.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk: \n   ``` \n   (0073) self.auto_id = auto_id\n   +        self.nonform_error_class = 'nonform'\n   ```\n   This adds a new class attribute `nonform_error_class` set to 'nonform'.\n\n2. Modified Hunk:\n   ```\n   (0291) def non_form_errors(self):\n   +    ..., error_class=self.nonform_error_class\n   ```\n\nThis extends existing logic to return non-form errors wrapped with the new CSS class 'nonform' as defined previously.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct class and functions. Specifically, it addresses the initialization of the CSS class in `BaseFormSet.__init__` and the method returning non-form errors in `non_form_errors`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are introduced by the patch. It competently inserts functionality without breaking any existing logic of the `BaseFormSet` class or deviating from the standard ErrorList behavior seen elsewhere (e.g., in `non_field_errors`).\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch does address the issue adequately:\n1. Correctly adds the CSS class 'nonform' for better error handling distinction.\n2. Dynamically pass the newly added class in rendering non-form error lists, directly associating these errors with the 'nonform' class.\nFurther, by closely following the structure of similar error class handling processes (as seen in spans for `non_field_errors` and `full_clean`), it guarantees consistency without redundancy or impacting other unrelated parts of the class functionality.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
