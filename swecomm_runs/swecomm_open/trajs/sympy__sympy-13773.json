                    "msg": "### Step 1: Understand the issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the `@` operator, which corresponds to the `__matmul__` method in the `Matrix` class, incorrectly handles cases where one of the operands is not a matrix. According to the problem, this operator should work only for matrix multiplication and throw an error for scalars or other non-matrix types, similar to how NumPy handles this. Currently, the `@` operator is behaving like the `*` operator which allows multiplication with scalars, and it needs to be fixed to restrict it to matrices solely.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n\n1. `MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__`\n2. `MatrixArithmetic.__rmatmul__`\n3. `MatrixArithmetic.__mul__`\n4. `MatrixExpr.__matmul__`\n5. `MatrixExpr.__rmatmul__`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__`: This is likely where the `@` operator is implemented, and correcting this method seems critical to ensure `@` only allows matrix-by-matrix operations.\n2. `MatrixArithmetic.__rmatmul__`: This handles the right-side `@` operation and needs a similar restriction to ensure scalars can't use the `@` operator with matrix objects.\n3. `MatrixArithmetic.__mul__`: This shows how `*` operation allows both scalar and matrix multiplications, unlike what `@` should do. This method incorrectly gets replicated for `__matmul__`.\n4. `MatrixExpr.__matmul__`: Similar to the identified issue, this method should also handle non-matrix operands by throwing an error.\n5. `MatrixExpr.__rmatmul__`: When the matrix is on the right side of the `@` operator, its logic is also important to restrict scalar operators.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n\n1. Patch involves files: `sympy/assumptions/sathandlers.py`, `sympy/core/basic.py`, `sympy/core/containers.py`, `sympy/matrices/dense.py`, and `sympy/plotting/plot.py`.\n2. The key changes fix the `__matmul__` method for `DenseMatrix`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **`sympy/assumptions/sathandlers.py`**:\n   - Changed import statements from `collections` to `collections.abc`.\n2. **`sympy/core/basic.py`**:\n   - Changed import statements from `collections` to `collections.abc`.\n3. **`sympy/core/containers.py`**:\n   - Changed import statements from `collections` to `collections.abc`.\n4. **`sympy/matrices/dense.py`**:\n   - Introduced `__matmul__` method to enforce matrix-only multiplication and raise a `ValueError` for scalar operands.\n5. **`sympy/plotting/plot.py`**:\n   - Changed import statements from `collections` to `collections.abc`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `DenseMatrix` class\u2019s `__matmul__` method which fits the specified issue constraints. \nHowever, it missed other locations/methods like `MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__` and related overridden methods in helper classes, which are likely targets per the identified code spans.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new critical issues found directly in `DenseMatrix`.\nStill, it should be additionally validated if other matrix-derived classes e.g., `ImmutableMatrix` inherit this change or require explicit handling.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe introduced `__matmul__` does fix the issue of restricting scalar usage but misses ensuring comprehensive application of this criteria at all necessary points, such as `MatrixArithmetic.__matmul__` and related `__rmatmul__`. Simply modifying `DenseMatrix` impacts numerous classes, so ensuring cross-compatibility uniformly is essential.\nMoreover, the issue signally hints other related classes interact improperly via `*` \u2014 requiring fixes therein for a fully robust resolution.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>4</score>"
