By being included in this table, these functions will now be handled by the same conditional logic that applies the full function naming (i.e., adding the `arc` prefix). As this matches the structure currently used for other inverse trig functions with `inv_trig_style=\"full\"`, the patch should solve the problem as described.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Specifically, the list `inv_trig_table`, which dictates the functions processed as inverse trig functions, needs to include `acsc` and `asec`.</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Explanation\n**Modified Hunks:**\n\n1. Change in sympy/printing/latex.py starting at line 743:\n   - **Before:**\n     ```python\n     inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acot\"]\n     ```\n   - **After:**\n     ```python\n     inv_trig_table = [\"asin\", \"acos\", \"atan\", \"acsc\", \"asec\", \"acot\"]\n     ```\n\n2. Addition of a new test file named test_latex_inv_trig.py:\n   ```python\n   from sympy import symbols, acsc, asec, latex\n   \n   x = symbols('x')\n   \n   print(\"Testing acsc:\")\n   print(latex(acsc(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\"))\n   \n   print(\"\\nTesting asec:\")\n   print(latex(asec(x), inv_trig_style=\"full\"))\n   ```\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies `sympy/printing/latex.py` to add `acsc` and `asec` to the `inv_trig_table` list, ensuring these functions receive the same treatment as other inverse trigonometric functions.\n2. The patch also introduces a sampling test file, `test_latex_inv_trig.py`, which appears to aim for some manual testing but it\u2019s rudimentary.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location of the Fix\n<correct_location_exp>The patch is modifying the correct location in `sympy/printing/latex.py`. The changes to the `inv_trig_table` directly impact the handling of inverse trig functions within the `_print_Function` method of the `LatexPrinter` class.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introduction of New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>There do not appear to be any new issues or contradictions between the identified code spans and the proposed changes. The patch simply replaces the term `inv_trig_table` to include `acsc` and `asec`, so it does not introduce any new variables or dependencies that could cause issues.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Conclusion on Issue Fixing\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch successfully addresses the issue by adding `acsc` and `asec` to the `inv_trig_table`. This ensures that these functions will be formatted correctly under the \"full\" style of inverse trigonometric function names. Additionally, the patch did not fall into common LLM mistakes such as incorrect synax or logical flow. Finally, while `test_latex_inv_trig.py` does some rudimentary manual tests, incorporating fully automated tests would be a recommended practice to confirm without manual inspection.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
