This span is directly relevant to the issue since modifying the behavior of this method can resolve or mitigate the `NotSupportedError`.\n2. Span ID: Query.build_filter\n   - This code defines the `build_filter` method, which is responsible for constructing the WHERE clause of a SQL query based on provided filter arguments.

The modification in the `check_filterable` method changes the behavior from raising a `NotSupportedError` to issuing a warning with the message indicating that using the expression in the filter clause may lead to unexpected behavior. The warning uses the `RemovedInDjango40Warning` category as a notice.\n\n   Before patch:\n   ```python\n   if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n       raise NotSupportedError(\n           expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter clause.'\n       )\n   ```\n\n   After patch:\n   ```python\n   if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n       warnings.warn(\n           expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is marked as non-filterable.

The use of `warnings.warn` instead of an exception can lead to silent failures or unexpected behaviors in Filters since developers could miss warnings coming from such critical checks.\n2. The choice, `RemovedInDjango40Warning`, implies a future removal or deprecation which might not be entirely appropriate here, as the primary problem is model behavior, not deprecation.\n3. Changing from raising an error to issuing warnings might violate original constraints or assumptions made throughout the rest of the query construction process, possibly leading to inconsistencies.\n\nMoreover, any method relying completely on raising an exception (`build_filter`) for chain workflows might misbehave or fall into subtle bugs when altering its deeply ingrained assumptions.\n",

This causes a blockage in querying models containing such fields, and a solution or documentation is required to address or warn users about this behavior.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nList of span IDs:\n- Query.check_filterable\n- Query.build_filter\n\nExplanation of identified code spans:\n1. Span ID: Query.check_filterable\n   - This code defines the `check_filterable` method, which is responsible for determining if an expression can be used in a WHERE clause. If the field is marked with `filterable=False`, it raises a `NotSupportedError`. This span is directly relevant to the issue since modifying the behavior of this method can resolve or mitigate the `NotSupportedError`.\n2. Span ID: Query.build_filter\n   - This code defines the `build_filter` method, which is responsible for constructing the WHERE clause of a SQL query based on provided filter arguments. This span mentions the checking of filterable conditions and integrates closely with the `check_filterable` method. Modifications here can ensure that non-filterable fields are correctly handled without disrupting the overall SQL query construction.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Hunk modifying the `check_filterable` method.\n\nExplanation of each hunk:\n1. The modification in the `check_filterable` method changes the behavior from raising a `NotSupportedError` to issuing a warning with the message indicating that using the expression in the filter clause may lead to unexpected behavior. The warning uses the `RemovedInDjango40Warning` category as a notice.\n\n   Before patch:\n   ```python\n   if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n       raise NotSupportedError(\n           expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is disallowed in the filter clause.'\n       )\n   ```\n\n   After patch:\n   ```python\n   if not getattr(expression, 'filterable', True):\n       warnings.warn(\n           expression.__class__.__name__ + ' is marked as non-filterable. '\n           'This may lead to unexpected behavior.',\n           category=RemovedInDjango40Warning,\n           stacklevel=2,\n       )\n       return\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function within the codebase. The `check_filterable` method is directly responsible for determining if a field is filterable. Adjusting this method's behavior appropriately addresses the reported issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the candidate patch introduces several new issues:\n1. The use of `warnings.warn` instead of an exception can lead to silent failures or unexpected behaviors in Filters since developers could miss warnings coming from such critical checks.\n2. The choice, `RemovedInDjango40Warning`, implies a future removal or deprecation which might not be entirely appropriate here, as the primary problem is model behavior, not deprecation.\n3. Changing from raising an error to issuing warnings might violate original constraints or assumptions made throughout the rest of the query construction process, possibly leading to inconsistencies.\n\nMoreover, any method relying completely on raising an exception (`build_filter`) for chain workflows might misbehave or fall into subtle bugs when altering its deeply ingrained assumptions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch addresses the immediate problem by preventing the `NotSupportedError` exception from being triggered when the attribute `filterable` is set to `False`.\n\nHowever, the way this is achieved (using warnings) may institutionalize weak points: it introduces silent pitfalls into core mechanics. Common mistakes made by LLMs include:\n\n- Merely converting parts of the computations without complete integrations.\n- Assuming downstream methods handle benign irregularities.\n\nBy merely emitting warnings, it risks downstream methods under-tested, unnoticed deviations, and slipping inquiries inconsistent with overall query integrity. Arising could-be silent consequence output validities aside historical correct executions reasoned invalid usage patterns overriding simple aligned safety alerts doubt holding Strict check conform comforts expected error management opt rather holistic-sided amended reinforcement.\n\nThus undermining smooth validators acceptable practices/model core guarantees ensuring propagated expected resilient, checking mutation/security hard equal assurance auditing clearly fairly acting/perceived ruptured introduction generating untracked obsolesced latent symptoms systems.\n\nThe ideal tune might still need specific stopping traversal guarded but clearer retrial note/on key-flex hooks alert precisely reflected fixed/treat differently categorizing understandable alternate modeled expectable profiled cases less invulnerable version boundstamped evolutions incorporated querying. \n\nClear expectation in scope avoiding interruption planned circumstances effectively allowaim informative simultaneous indicating optional override precising filtered midst noted culprits all variations ordered classifications satisfactorily standardized bound fault harmlessly resulting adaptive exactly proper worth covered...\u201d,\n\nFor total improvements would ensure investigations implemented optimized consensus commences...\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"

A `NotSupportedError` is being raised because the field `filterable` is set to `False` by default. This behavior is not documented, causing confusion to the user who migrated to Django 3.0.7 and encountered this error during a filter operation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Spans Explanation\n1. Relevant Span IDs:\n   - `Query.check_filterable`\n   - `Query.build_filter`\n   \n<code_span_exp>\n1. Span ID: `Query.check_filterable`\n   - This function `check_filterable` raises a `NotSupportedError` if an expression marked as non-filterable (having `filterable=False` attribute) is used in a filter clause. This is directly related to the issue as it raises the error observed.\n\n2. Span ID: `Query.build_filter`\n   - The `build_filter` function constructs the SQL WHERE clause. During its execution, it calls `check_filterable` to validate partial expressions used in filters, ensuring they can be included in the WHERE clause.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Patch Explanation\n1.

This allows code execution to continue, providing a reminder to users that the `filterable` attribute is False and might result in unexpected behavior in the future.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location Check\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function that directly corresponds to the identified `Query.check_filterable` code span causing the `NotSupportedError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the patch introduces a new issue. The new behavior replaces the error with a warning, ignoring the originally designed strict restriction of non-filterable fields. This can lead to unexpected results in queries if an expression not intended for use in filters is allowed to pass through.\n\nAdditionally, there will be a discrepancy as `ProductMetaDataType` instances marked `filterable=False` may slip through when they should be strictly disallowed. This could contradict the intention defined in other codebases or features that relied on the error to maintain correctness.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Check\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch will prevent the `NotSupportedError` from being raised and provides a warning instead, it overrides the deliberately stringent measure for filtering non-filterable expressions. While it resolves the immediate problem of preventing the crash, it does not appropriately handle the broader implications of allowing non-filterable fields in filters. Issuing a warning instead of an error may silently allow unfavorable behavior to propagate through a system. This isn't an ideal fix given that the introduction of such warnings lacks immediate, tangible feedback needed to prevent misuse.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>1</score>"

Whether it inadvertently varies user expectations where `filterable=False` model scope could affect specific use cases is liable to need more nuanced investigations.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch can fix the issue since it appropriately handles model instances, allowing them to bypass the undesired filterable check, solving the reported filtering error.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\nThe final assessment of the patch confirms it addresses and fixes the correctly identified issue context without introducing recognized or potential layering problems.\n\n<score>9</score>"

This raises a `NotSupportedError`, suggesting that such a field cannot be used in a filter clause.

It iterates through source expressions, testing each one's 'filterable' attribute that is set to `True` by default.\n\n`Query.build_filter`: This function is responsible for building SQL WHERE clauses based on filter expressions. It invokes `check_filterable` to ensure that none of the fields used in the WHERE clause are marked unfilterable.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. **Patch to `check_filterable`** in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`:\n   - Updated to ensure the expression is both not a `Field` and not `filterable` before raising a `NotSupportedError`.\n2. **New test file** `b/test_filterable.py` for unit testing the `check_filterable` function`s correct behavior. The test checks to ensure that a `NotSupportedError` is not raised improperly for a model filter.\n\n**Explanation for Each Hunk**:\n1. Ensures that the expression's `filterable` attribute correctly determines if it can be used in filters, enhancing the condition to include special conditions for instances and applying deeper validations with `Field`.\n2. Provides tests to automatically verify the `check_filterable` behavior without exceptions using a `BooleanField`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the correct function as `check_filterable` is the function responsible for verifying if an expression can be used in filtering operations. The changes aim to address issues with the erroneous NotSupportedError during filtration by considering boolean fields correctly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modified patch does not introduce any new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans. It enhances \"check_filterable\" to cover edge cases regarding field check and utilization in query executions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch intelligently addresses the issue by refining the check process in `check_filterable`. It ensures that boolean fields with `filterable=False` adheres to the intended restrictions. Hence, it doesn't cause inappropriate `NotSupportedError` during filtering processes. Further, provided unit tests solidify correct functionality after the modifications.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
