It provides the necessary printing infrastructure that `VectorPrettyPrinter` relies on.\n- **PrettyPrinter._print_Integral**: This method handles the pretty printing of integral expressions, which could involve vectors and need to correctly place sub-expressions.\n- **CoordSys3D**: Defines the 3D coordinate system crucial for referring vectors in a structured form.\n- **Del**: Represents the vector differential operator (`nabla`), used within vector-related mathematical expressions.\n- **Vector**: Superclass for all vector classes in `sympy`, making it central to any vector operations and their representations.\n- **vpprint**: This function is for pretty printing expressions from the `sympy.physics.vector` package.\n- **VectorPrettyPrinter._print_Function**: This method is a specialized printing method within `VectorPrettyPrinter` that adds specific traits for printing functions, dynamic symbols, and should ensure vectors are printed correctly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1: Lines 172-180**: Adds a new method `_print_Vector` to `VectorPrettyPrinter`. This method first checks if the expression is an instance of `Vector`. If it is, it extracts the vector's components and uses existing printing methods to handle them. If no specialized handling exists, it should attempt to call a superclass's `_print_Vector` method (if it exists), or fall back to a simple string representation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch introduces modifications in the `VectorPrettyPrinter` class, specifically aimed at improving how `Vector` expressions are processed and printed. Given the issue revolves around the improper format of vector outputs, the patch touches the appropriate spot.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch should not contradict any existing identified code spans. The handling in the new `_print_Vector` method is cautious about failing gracefully and relies on superclass methods when specific cases aren't handled within `VectorPrettyPrinter` itself. It seems not to introduce new issues directly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch properly aims to add a custom vector printer to handle the vector components explicitly, addressing incorrect placements of the unit vectors in the display. This should resolve the issue described.\n\nPotential common mistakes avoided:\n1. Scale or modified internals aren't hitting functionality beyond needed vector components.\n2. Retains fallbacks to maintain the wide range.\n3. Keeps type-check logic (`isinstance`) solid.\n\nHowever, there is no direct test or validation code added to definitively ensure fixing fully. Ensuring coverage via unit tests would nail the final confidence.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
