                    "msg": "### Step 1: Understand the issue\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about incorrect caching of string condition evaluations for the `skipif` and `xfail` markers in pytest. When the string conditions, such as `@pytest.mark.skipif(\"sys.platform == 'win32'\")`, are evaluated, their caching key is based only on the string value itself. However, the correct evaluation of these conditions also depends on the item's globals. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect behavior. The proposed solution suggests removing caching altogether and directly evaluating strings within the `MarkEvaluator._istrue` method.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n<span_ids>\n- MarkEvaluator._istrue\n- MarkEvaluator\n- MarkEvaluator._getglobals\n- cached_eval\n- imports\n</span_ids>\n<code_span_exp>\n- **MarkEvaluator._istrue**: This method evaluates whether the condition attached to a mark (such as `skipif` or `xfail`) is true. It currently uses `cached_eval`, which contributes directly to the identified issue with caching.\n- **MarkEvaluator**: This class utilizes relevant methods and attributes essential for skip/xfail evaluation. The main logic to determine if these markers should affect the test resides here.\n- **MarkEvaluator._getglobals**: This method gathers the necessary globals to accurately evaluate conditional expressions. These globals are crucial but are overlooked in the current caching mechanism.\n- **cached_eval**: This function performs the cached evaluation of the provided expression. The identified issue stems directly from the behavior of this function, as it does not account for item's globals.\n- **imports**: This spans the imports section, containing essential imports like `os`, `sys`, `fail`, and `TEST_OUTCOME`, which are necessary for the proper functioning of the `MarkEvaluator` class.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n<hunks>\n- Modification of import statements: New import to support traceback handling.\n- Complete removal of `cached_eval` method.\n- Refactoring `MarkEvaluator` class' method `_istrue()` by integrating the logic initially handled by `cached_eval`.\n</hunks>\n<patch_exp>\n- **Patch Explanation of Import and General Setup**: The code includes import libraries such as `traceback` in `_pytest/mark/evaluate.py`, previously handled in another module serving as backup.\n- **Patch Explanation on MarkEvaluator Class Changes**:\n    - Removes the `cached_eval` function entirely.\n    - In the `MarkEvaluator._istrue` method, direct evaluation replaces calls to `cached_eval`. Transient compilation and evaluation of conditions (strings/expression) occur each time without relying on a pre-stored cache.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the correct locations, specifically targeting the functions and methods involved in handling the evaluation of conditions for skip/xfail markers. This includes primarily touching upon `MarkEvaluator._istrue` and appropriately removing `cached_eval`. Thus, it is addressing the relevant portion of the code where inaccurate caching would occur.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Introduction of New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are apparent. The removal of caching and inlining evaluations within the `MarkEvaluator._istrue` does not introduce conflicting logic or contradictions compared to the previous identified spans. The newly added `eval` process correctly replaces the previously cached component.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Does the Patch Fix the Issue?\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively removes the caching strategy prone to errors caused by context-specific globals. By evaluating the expressions on-the-fly inside `MarkEvaluator._istrue`, it ensures accuracy, reflective of the current state and environment variables. Checking thoroughly against common errors such an improper use of global data, extraneous computations, or performance implications, the solution seems robust and appropriate.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>\n"
