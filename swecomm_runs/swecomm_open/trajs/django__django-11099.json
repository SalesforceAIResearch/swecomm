This happens because the `$` character matches the end of a string and will also match a string ending with a newline. The recommendation is to use `\\A` and `\\Z` instead of `^` and `$` to enforce stricter boundary constraints, which will prevent usernames from containing trailing newlines.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n\n**List of Span IDs:**\n- `UnicodeUsernameValidator`\n- `ASCIIUsernameValidator`\n- `imports`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **UnicodeUsernameValidator**: This code span defines the class `UnicodeUsernameValidator`, which uses a regex pattern with `^` and `$` to validate usernames.

Understand the issue:\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue in the codebase is that the regular expressions used in `ASCIIUsernameValidator` and `UnicodeUsernameValidator` allow for trailing newlines in usernames. The regex uses `$` to match the end of the string, which also matches a trailing newline in Python regex. This behavior allows usernames ending with newlines to be valid, which is unintended. The suggested fix is to replace `$` with `\\Z` to avoid this behavior.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2.
