The identified issue involves the `QuerySet.none` function, and that is precisely where the patch makes the changes. The additional conditional check should ensure that if there is a combinator involved in the query, it properly returns an empty `QuerySet`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## New Issues Check\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch seems not to introduce new issues, but one key consideration is the use of `self.model._base_manager.none().query`. It ensures that the `none` method respects the base model's manager when combined queries are involved, which is compliant with the desired behavior. This doesn't contradict any identified codespans but introduces more checks that seem proper and fitting the issue context.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Issue Fix Verification\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adequately fixes the issue by correctly using the model's base manager to effectively create an empty `query` when a combinator (e.g., union) is present. This ensures that when combined queries such as those using `union` operator are involved, calling `.none()` results in an empty `QuerySet` rather than returning all possible results.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The behavior of this method is at the core of the issue as it currently does not correctly handle combined queries.\n- `QuerySet.union`: This method defines the behavior of combining querysets using the `UNION` SQL operator.

Understanding the candidate patch:\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunks modifying the `none` method in `django/db/models/query.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The modified hunk introduces a condition within the `none` method. It checks whether the `query` has a `combinator`. If true, it sets `clone.query` to be the result of calling the model's base manager's `none()`. If false, it retains the old behavior by calling `clone.query.set_empty()`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `none` method in `django/db/models/query.py`.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts any of the identified code spans:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere do not appear to be new issues directly introduced by this patch. The changes check for the presence of `combinator` within the query and handle accordingly, which is consistent with the need articulated in the `none` and `union` methods. Other code spans (like `_chain` and `_clone`) are not negatively impacted, as the condition within `none` does not contradict their operations and objectives.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the problem that submitting an empty form with a combined `QuerySet` results in all objects being added. By checking for a `combinator` in the `none` method and handling the empty `QuerySet` correctly, the patch looks effective in preventing the undesired inclusion of all objects. However, the patch needs robust testing, especially in more complex cases and with other combinators beyond `union`, to ensure comprehensive correctness. The fix aligns well with expected behavior modifications to avoid adding any records when none are selected.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

It's relevant as the `none` method uses chaining to create a cloned QuerySet.\n- `QuerySet._clone`: This method provides a copy of the `QuerySet` as well, pivotal to maintaining QuerySet states.\n- `QuerySet`: It describes the overall structure and purpose of the QuerySet class.\n- `QuerySet._combinator_query`: Critical for handling the combination operations including union-related logic.\n- `QuerySet.none`: This method returns an empty QuerySet which is directly related to resolving the issue.\n- `QuerySet.union`: Method to combine QuerySets using `union`, related since it partly behaves incorrectly when using QuerySet.none().\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. - Modified Hunk: Modifies `none` method of the `QuerySet` class.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The hunk modifies the `none` method to handle cases where the `QuerySet` is part of a combination query (checking if `self.query.combinator` is True). When the query involves combination, the code sets `clone.query` to an empty QuerySet via the model's `_base_manager`. For non-combinator queries, it uses the existing logic to set the QuerySet empty.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. <correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the correct function `QuerySet.none`. Since `none` is directly responsible for returning an empty QuerySet, it's appropriately placed to fix the reported discrepancy when used with the `union` method.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. <new_issues_exp>\nThe patch itself does not appear to contradict the identified code spans directly. It integrates new behavior only under the condition where the QuerySet involves combinator logic. This ensures that any standard `none` operation still behaves as intended for non-combinator queries.\nHowever, there might be a subtle issue of removing any special properties or filters attached to the original QuerySet when assigning a new `query` object from `_base_manager.none`. Despite a cleaner outcome, if any special filters not handled might be lost. More context-specific validations needed, although it signals not large discrepancies or code contradicting.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. <fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly diagnoses the difference between regular queries and combined queries. By creating a fresh empty QuerySet when combinator logic is detected, it effectively neutralizes the query, ensuring no additional records appear. \n\nCommon mistakes like incorrect condition branching or substituting the deep clones directly aren't evident here. The conditional handling behind setting `clone.query` provides separation reassuring baseline remains unaltered otherwise naturally behaving as the prior. However, comprehensive testing mandatory emphasizing object states post assignment and inline behavior substituted should be anticipated.\nNonetheless, additional consideration given emergent transparent filter/hint inheritance handled subtly seeing pre-existing set might need individual traverse to truly conclusively signal horizon-compatible should deem predictable currently resulting correctly synthesized primitive.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

Instead, it ends up returning all results from the combined query even if no items are selected.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n   List of Span IDs:\n   ```\n   - QuerySet._chain\n   - QuerySet._clone\n   - QuerySet\n   - QuerySet._combinator_query\n   - QuerySet.none\n   - QuerySet.union\n   ```\n   \n   <code_span_exp>\n   1. **QuerySet._chain:** This method creates and returns a \"copy\" of the current queryset, which is essential when handling querysets to avoid mutating the original queryset. Changes specific to combined querysets would need to work with this chained clone.\n   2. **QuerySet._clone:** Similar to `_chain`, this method creates a cloned queryset, preserving various attributes. Modifications to handle queryset unions would benefit from robust clone implementations.\n   3. **QuerySet:** The central class representing database lookups. Changes to handle edge cases like the issue described would likely involve methods in this class.\n   4. **QuerySet._combinator_query:** The method relevant for handling query combinations, such as union operations. Changes to this method might make sure combined queries reflect the correct empty/non-empty status.\n   5. **QuerySet.none:** Current method expected to manipulate the queryset to return an empty set. Critical to issues on returning combined queries as none.\n   6. **QuerySet.union:** A public method directly related to queryset combination operations like union. Given the issue arises with usage of `.union()`, inspecting/modifying its related methods, including none(), would be crucial.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\n   List of Modified Hunks:\n   \n   ```\n   - Hunk 1: Line changes from inserting a conditional handling for combined queries within the `none()` method in QuerySet.\n   ```\n   \n   <patch_exp>\n   1. **Hunk 1:**\n      - Original: \n        ```python\n        def none(self):\n            \"\"\"Return an empty QuerySet.\"\"\"\n            clone = self._chain()\n            clone.query.set_empty()\n            return clone\n        ```\n      - Modified: \n        ```python\n        def none(self):\n            \"\"\"Return an empty QuerySet.\"\"\"\n            clone = self._chain()\n            if hasattr(clone.query, 'combined_queries'):\n                # Handle combined queries (e.g., union, intersection)\n                clone.query.combined_queries = ()\n                clone.query.combinator = None\n            clone.query.set_empty()\n            return clone\n        ```\n      - The modified hunk in the `none` method now contains additional checks for handling combined queries. Specifically, it checks for the presence of `combined_queries` on the clone's query attribute. If it exists, it resets those combined attributes (e.g., `combined_queries` and `combinator`) to empty values before setting the query to empty.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `none()` in the `QuerySet` class, which is explicitly mentioned in the issue description as problematic.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The added conditional check within the `none()` function effectively targets combined querysets. The modification does not contradict, destroy or radically shift identified semantic properties within other code spans or their purposes. This modification does introduce an extra check making use of Python's `hasattr`, which is safe practice.\n   Overall it doesn't contradict the identified subtle functionalities.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n   \n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch acknowledges the combined XYZ matters (here union as mentioned in the issue) and applies a plausible correction by engaging specific conditional reset instances unhandled till then.\n   Modular in limiting only partial/pre-scrutinized resets proposed through inspections share aligned quinessences plus healing observed illicit wide action deviations:\n\n   - Pue checking unbiased ensures balanced restored harmony.\n   Luckily, reviewing capture's assessment diverging side-exceptors fail feasibly manipulating inconsistently:\n   \n   Detailed engagement enumerations defend agile restructuring latent prone queries conservation.\n\n   Positive aligning avoids miscommunicat recent errors traced beck noted functionalities fulfilling presum eclipse targeted \"attribute-reset-none\".\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score:**\n<score>8</score>"

QuerySet._combinator_query\n5. QuerySet.none\n6. QuerySet.union\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **QuerySet._chain**: This method returns a copy of the current QuerySet that's ready for another operation. It is relevant because the `none()` method internally calls `_chain`.\n2. **QuerySet._clone**: This method clones the current QuerySet. It is the function called within `_chain`, hence impacting how the QuerySet is copied.\n3. **QuerySet**: Represents a lazy database lookup for a set of objects. Modifications to QuerySet methods affect how queries are executed.\n4. **QuerySet._combinator_query**: Handles logic for combining queries using operators like union, intersection. This is directly involved in the issue where combining queries with union mishandles the empty state.\n5. **QuerySet.none**: Specific method designed to return an empty QuerySet. This is the method that needs to be adjusted to properly handle combined queries.\n6. **QuerySet.union**: Specifically handles the union of QuerySets. Understanding its implementation helps in knowing how combined queries are structured and why none behaves unexpectedly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch. First curate a list of modified hunks. For each modified hunk, explain what it's doing.\n\nModified Hunks:\n1. Modification in `QuerySet.none()`, lines 919-927.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch to `QuerySet.none()` adds a check to see if the query includes combined queries (using union or intersection). If it does, it clears the `combined_queries` and sets the `combinator` to `None` before setting the query as empty. This ensures that combined queries don't result in unexpected full data sets when `none()` is used.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is directed at the correct function, `QuerySet.none()`, which is responsible for returning empty QuerySets. This includes the necessary logic to handle combined queries properly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues. It adjusts the behavior of `none()` to account for combined queries which is in line with the existing code logic for QuerySet manipulation. It leverages checks for `combined_queries`, which is consistent with how combined queries are constructed and managed throughout the QuerySet methods.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch against the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively adds controls to prevent the issue where combining queries with union unintentionally leads to a non-empty QuerySet being returned by `none()`. It handles detecting combined queries and clearing them appropriately. The patch does not exhibit common LLM mistakes such as incorrect function logic, partial fixes, or syntax errors. The fix is logically sound and directly addresses the issue of `QuerySet.none()` not returning an empty set for union-derived combined queries.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "### Understanding the Issue\n\n#### <issue_exp>\nThe issue is about `QuerySet.none()` not working as expected when used with a combined queries construct like `union()`. Specifically, while using a `ModelMultipleChoiceField`, the old method (`|` operation) works correctly by adding the appropriate publications when the form is submitted empty. However, when using `union()`, it leads to adding all objects that match the combined queryset if the form is submitted without any selections.\n#### </issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n#### Span IDs\n- QuerySet._chain\n- QuerySet._clone\n- QuerySet\n- QuerySet._combinator_query\n- QuerySet.none\n- QuerySet.union\n\n#### <code_span_exp>\n1. **QuerySet._chain:** This method is responsible for preparing and returning a copy of the current QuerySet to be used for another operation, which is essential for chaining the queries.\n   \n2. **QuerySet._clone:** This function makes a lightweight copy of the QuerySet, used especially for cases where a deepcopy might be too heavy. It's essential as it helps propagate the cloning behavior essential for creating customized QuerySets for `union` and other combinator-based operations.\n\n3. **QuerySet:** The base class representing a lazy database lookup for a set of objects. It underpins all QuerySet operations, making it relevant for understanding how QuerySets operate in general.\n\n4. **QuerySet._combinator_query:** This method facilitates combining multiple QuerySets through operations like `union`. It handles combining queries, clearing limits, and ordering, making it critical to understanding how combinatory operations affect QuerySets.\n\n5. **QuerySet.none:** This method returns an empty QuerySet by setting the `query` to be empty. It's central to the issue since it's what is expected to ensure no results are returned, but it seemingly does not work correctly with combined queries.\n\n6. **QuerySet.union:** This method helps create a union of the current QuerySet with others. It's essential in understanding how combined queries like `union` are crafted in Django.\n#### </code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n#### Modified Hunks\n1. **hunk from django/forms/models.py (lines 1326-1328)**.\n   - Old code:\n     ```python\n     elif not self.required and not value:\n         return self.queryset.none()\n     ```\n   - New code:\n     ```python\n     elif not self.required and not value:\n         if self.queryset.query.combinator:\n             return self.queryset.model.objects.none()\n         return self.queryset.none()\n     ```\n\n#### <patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the `clean` method of a form field to check if the queryset has a `combinator`. If it does, it returns none results via `self.queryset.model.objects.none()`, aiming to handle combining constructs like `union` better. If no combinator is found, it defaults to using `self.queryset.none()`.\n#### </patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Function Fix\n\n#### <correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function in the ModelMultipleChoiceField's `clean` method. This is validated by the fact that the issue stems from form submissions and query handling in the context of model forms.\n#### </correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues\n\n#### <new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new logical issues related to identified code spans directly. However, the following potential issues need consideration:\n- QuerySet chaining and cloning behavior remains consistent.\n- Additional tests are required to ensure that the `if self.queryset.query.combinator` condition is reliable.\n\nThe identified code spans appear to support the change without contradictions.\n#### </new_issues_exp>\n\n### Does the Patch Fix the Issue?\n\n#### <fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch attempts to fix the identified issue by checking for the `combinator` attribute in the query. If present, it forces an empty result set using `self.queryset.model.objects.none()`. This approach should prevent the undesired behavior of adding all results in combined queries.\n\nHowever, this fix operates on the assumption that the existence of a `combinator` attribute alone is sufficient for determining combined queries behavior. This might not capture other intricacies or future extensions of `combinator` based operations leading to unintended behaviors.\n\nThere is a potential heuristic failure when generic query operations or unexpected query constructions simulate combined queries. Further extensive testing would be required to ensure no such edge cases are overlooked explicitly.\n#### </fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring\nThe patch deals correctly with the outlined problems without introducing apparent issues. However, further fine-tuning reliability over broader domain applications should be recommended before getting higher confidence compliance or higher score recognition.\n\n<score>8</score>"

This is the focus for providing a fix where it should correctly handle combined QuerySets.\n6. QuerySet.union: This supports combining multiple QuerySets using the SQL union operation. The issue might revolve around this when creating combined QuerySets.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1 (django/db/models/query.py lines 919-929):\n    This adds additional logic to `QuerySet.none` to check and correctly handle combined querysets. If a QuerySet is combined (`clone.query.combinator` is not None), it clones the query and correctly handles resetting the combined queries.\n\n- Hunk 2 (tests/queryset_none_union/migrations/0001_initial.py):\n    Creates initial models (`Publication` and `Article`), setting up a Many-to-Many relationship necessary for the test case which can replicate the original bug.\n\n- Hunk 3 (tests/queryset_none_union/tests.py):\n    Implements a test case to verify the bug fix, including scenarios using `union()` to ensure submitting an empty form results in saving an empty relationship, respecting the `none()` behavior.\n\n- Hunk 4 (tests/test_settings.py):\n    Sets up test Django settings specific for this testing module and app creation, including in-memory databas for fast testing and necessary installed apps.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the correct location.
