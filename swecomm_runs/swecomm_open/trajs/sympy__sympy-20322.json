In SymPy version 1.5.1 both `sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False).simplify()` and `sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=True).simplify()` give the same result, whereas in version 1.6.2, the results differ.

Checking the Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\n\nYes, the patch is modifying relevant functions in `sympify.py` (for overall handling of evaluations within `sympify` function) and `integers.py` (ensuring rewrite rules consider the `evaluate` parameter consistently better).\n\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Checking for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\n\nThe patch introduces handling for the `evaluate` parameter within transformations using ceiling by providing branches for `if kwargs.get('evaluate', True)`.

Assessing Fixing Potential\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n\nThe proposed changes cleverly append `evaluate` considerations to preserve logical behavior for ceiling while interpolating differences flagged in the detailed issue perception. These checks prevent vise versa recalculations under unintended circumstances for transformations. It's appropriately aligned to avoid common pitfalls such as disregarding nested `evaluate` invariability, overruling transformations internal logic interdependent only on explicit rewritten clauses.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span ids: \n- Infinity.ceiling\n- NaN.ceiling\n- Rational.ceiling\n- Float.ceiling\n- ComplexInfinity.ceiling\n- NegativeInfinity.ceiling\n- Integer.ceiling\n- sympify\n- ceiling\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `Infinity.ceiling`: This code span shows the `ceiling` method for the `Infinity` type in sympy.\n2. `NaN.ceiling`: This code span shows the `ceiling` method for the `NaN` type in sympy.\n3. `Rational.ceiling`: This code span shows the `ceiling` method for the `Rational` type, which is relevant because 'x/4 - 3/4' often deals with rational numbers.\n4. `Float.ceiling`: This code span shows the `ceiling` method for the `Float` type.\n5. `ComplexInfinity.ceiling`: This code span shows the `ceiling` method for the `ComplexInfinity` type in sympy.\n6. `NegativeInfinity.ceiling`: This code span shows the `ceiling` method for the `NegativeInfinity` type in sympy.\n7. `Integer.ceiling`: This code span shows the `ceiling` method for the `Integer` type in sympy and directly influences how the ceiling values are handled.\n8. `sympify`: This is the main method where parsing is taking place and partial evaluation strategies like evaluate comes into play.\n9. `ceiling`: This code span shows the class definition and behavior of the `ceiling` function in sympy, pivotal to understand what transformations should be occurring inside `sympify`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n## 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Modified hunk in `sympy/core/sympify.py` at lines 473 to 487.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the `sympify` function within `sympy/core/sympify.py`. Specifically, it adds a conditional check right after parsing (via `parse_expr(a, local_dict=locals, transformations=transformations, evaluate=evaluate)`) to expand functions if `evaluate` is set to `False`. This is done using `expand_func`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## 4. Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct location. Changes are made within the `sympify` function in `sympy/core/sympify.py`, which is responsible for the parsing behavior and where the `evaluate` parameter affects its evaluations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## 5. Introduction of New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nIt does not seem that the patch introduces any new issues or directly contradicts the identified code spans. The introduction of `expand_func` after parsing with `evaluate=False` is an intended behavior to ensure consistency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## 6. Fixes the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to correctly address the issue by expanding functions when `evaluate` is set to `False`. Given that the changes intercept immediately after parsing and ensure the function is expanded, the expression should remain consistent whether evaluate is set to `False` or `True`. However, thorough testing with more diverse inputs is recommended to validate this behavior entirely.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

In sympy version 1.5.1, using `sympy.sympify('4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)', evaluate=False).simplify()` retains the expression as `4*ceiling(x/4 - 3/4)`, but in version 1.6.2, it gets transformed to `4*ceiling(x/4) - 3`. This behavior is inconsistent with the expected output, especially when parsing with `evaluate=False`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span ids:\n- Infinity.ceiling\n- NaN.ceiling\n- Rational.ceiling\n- Float.ceiling\n- ComplexInfinity.ceiling\n- NegativeInfinity.ceiling\n- Integer.ceiling\n- sympify\n- ceiling\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Infinity.ceiling: This method, implemented on line 2988, ensures the `ceiling` function returns the `Infinity` instance itself.\n- NaN.ceiling: This method on line 3251 ensures the `ceiling` function returns the `NaN` instance itself.\n- Rational.ceiling: This method on line 1864 implements the ceiling functionality for `Rational` number, converting it according to specific rounding rules.\n- Float.ceiling: This method on line 1233 implements the ceiling functionality for floating-point numbers by using `mlib.mpf_ceil`.\n- ComplexInfinity.ceiling: This method on line 3337 ensures the `ceiling` function returns the `ComplexInfinity` instance itself.\n- NegativeInfinity.ceiling: This method on line 3151 ensures the `ceiling` function returns the `NegativeInfinity` instance itself.\n- Integer.ceiling: This method on line 2128 ensures that the `ceiling` of an integer returns the integer itself.\n- sympify: The implementation of the `sympify` function on line 92, which includes handling `evaluate` and other options, is directly relevant to how expressions are parsed and converted.\n- ceiling: The class on line 225 defines the `ceiling` function in more generic terms and includes documentation demonstrating expected behavior.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Change in file `a/sympy/simplify/simplify.py`: Line 567 \u2013 `expr = sympify(expr)` to `expr = sympify(expr, evaluate=False)`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the `simplify.py` on line 567 by changing the `sympify` call to enforce `evaluate=False`. This modification ensures the expression is parsed without evaluating the mathematical content unless explicitly requested.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check If the Patch Is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the `simplify.py` file directly at the point where the `sympify` function is called. Since the original issue revolves around the behavior of `sympify` when `evaluate=False`, this modification seems appropriate and directly relevant.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check If the Patch Is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new changes that contradict the identified code spans as per the provided data. It restricts `sympify` operations within `simplify.py` to always enforce `evaluate=False`, consistent with the earlier intended behavior highlighted in the issue. The added parameter is independent and won't disrupt other sympify functions since it's encapsulated within `simplify.py`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check If the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to address the reported inconsistency by ensuring `sympify` within `simplify.py` is always called with `evaluate=False`, preventing the automatic evaluation that led to the highlighted inconsistencies. This approach effectively ensures that the parsed expressions remain unchanged unless specified, aligning with the behavior seen in sympy v1.5.1.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score Calculation\nConsidering there are no contradictions or new issues introduced, and the function being patched is appropriate for addressing the issue:\n\n<score>9</score>"

You can do that even to\n+    classes that you do not own by subclassing or adding the method at runtime.\n+\n+    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n+    >>> class MyList1(object):\n+    ...     def __iter__(self):\n+    ...         yield 1\n+    ...         yield 2\n+    ...         return\n+    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n+    ...     def _sympy_(self): return Matrix(self)\n+    >>> sympify(MyList1())\n+    Matrix([\n+    [1],\n+    [2]])\n+\n+    If you do not have control over the class definition you could also use the\n+    ``converter`` global dictionary. The key is the class and the value is a\n+    function that takes a single argument and returns the desired SymPy\n+    object, e.g. ``converter[MyList] = lambda x: Matrix(x)``.\n+\n+    >>> class MyList2(object):   # XXX Do not do this if you control the class!\n+    ...     def __iter__(self):  #     Use _sympy_!\n+    ...         yield 1\n+    ...         yield 2\n+    ...         return\n+    ...     def __getitem__(self, i): return list(self)[i]\n+    >>> from sympy.core.sympify import converter\n+    >>> converter[MyList2] = lambda x: Matrix(x)\n+    >>> sympify(MyList2())\n+    Matrix([\n+    [1],\n+    [2]])\n+\n+    Notes\n+    =====\n+\n+    The keywords ``rational`` and ``convert_xor`` are only used\n+    when the input is a string.\n+\n+    convert_xor\n+    -----------\n+\n+    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=True)\n+    x**y\n+    >>> sympify('x^y',convert_xor=False)\n+    x ^ y\n+\n+    rational\n+    --------\n+\n+    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=False)\n+    0.1\n+    >>> sympify('0.1',rational=True)\n+    1/10\n+\n+    Sometimes autosimplification during sympification results in expressions\n+    that are very different in structure than what was entered.

                    "msg": "### Task Progression\n\n#### Understanding the Issue\n\nSympy is exhibiting inconsistent behavior for `sympify` when the `evaluate` parameter is set to `False`. The expression simplifies to different formats depending on the version of Sympy. The user is looking for consistent behavior regardless of the value of `evaluate` when parsing.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe problem is related to inconsistent behavior in Sympy's `sympify` function across different versions when dealing with the `ceiling` function in expressions. Specifically, the output differs when `evaluate=False`, leading to unexpected results for the user.\n</issue_exp>\n\n#### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\nRelevant Code Spans:\n\n1. `Infinity.ceiling`: `3357`\n2. `NaN.ceiling`: `3510`\n3. `Rational.ceiling`: `1623`\n4. `Float.ceiling`: `993`\n5. `ComplexInfinity.ceiling`: `1943`\n6. `NegativeInfinity.ceiling`: `2923`\n7. `Integer.ceiling`: `2358`\n8. `sympify`: `0152`\n9. `ceiling`: `0170`\n\nRelevance:\n\n1. **`Infinity.ceiling`**:\n   - Defines the `ceiling` function for the `Infinity` class, likely returns `Infinity`.\n   - Relevant for handling special cases in sympify operations.\n\n2. **`NaN.ceiling`**:\n   - Defines the `ceiling` function for the `NaN` class, likely returns `NaN`.\n   - Relevant for handling special cases in sympify operations.\n\n3. **`Rational.ceiling`**:\n   - Handles the ceiling operation for rational numbers. Important for parsing string expressions containing rational numbers.\n\n4. **`Float.ceiling`**:\n   - Defines how float numbers are rounded using ceiling operations. Relevant to how numerical inputs are processed when sympify involves floating-point numbers.\n\n5. **`ComplexInfinity.ceiling`**:\n   - Discusses handling cases involving complex infinity.\n\n6. **`NegativeInfinity.ceiling`**:\n   - Defines the handling of negative infinity return values relevant to the ceiling function.\n\n7. **`Integer.ceiling`**:\n   - Discusses integer behavior with respect to the ceiling function.\n\n8. **`sympify`**:\n   - Central function affected while attempting to resolve the issue. Contains essential logic and parameters including `evaluate`.\n   \n9. **`ceiling`**:\n   - Defines the core properties of the `ceiling` function used in various operations.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `Infinity.ceiling`: Defines the behavior of ceiling for Infinity, important for non-finite values support in sympify.\n2. `NaN.ceiling`: Defines behavior of ceiling for NaN, crucial for handling invalid floating-point numbers gracefully during parsing.\n3. `Rational.ceiling`: Manages ceiling operations for rational numbers, essential in a consistent simplification when parsing fractional expressions.\n4. `Float.ceiling`: Dictates how floating-point numbers are handled in ceiling operations, solving part of the float-related ambiguity in simplification.\n5. `ComplexInfinity.ceiling`: Handles complex infinite values within the ceiling context of sympify.\n6. `NegativeInfinity.ceiling`: Manages the impact of negative infinite values in parsing.\n7. `Integer.ceiling`: Formalizes the transformation of integer values under the ceiling operation, dictating how pure integer types are simplified.\n8. `sympify`: The principle function targeted in the fix and where evaluate issues stem from - impacting the reader\u2019s issue most directly.\n9. `ceiling`: Root function retaining overall characteristics for varied use by subclasses (Integer, Rational, Float etc.), and instrumental in returning the smallest integer not smaller than given value.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\nModified Hunks:\n\n1. Modified `sympify.py`: Added logic to set `evaluate` to `None`.\n2. Modified `sympify` docstring: Added notice for ignoring evaluate.\n3. Created backup `.backup.sympify.py` file.\n\nFor each modified hunk:\n\n1. **sympify.py Update**:\n    This hunk updates the `sympify` function to now explicitly ignore the `evaluate` parameter by setting it to `None` unconditionally.\n\n2. **sympify Docstring Update**:\n   The function docstring is updated to notify users that `evaluate` parameter is ignored regardless of its input.\n\n3. **Backup File Addition**:\n   A new `sympy/core/.backup.sympify.py` file likely as temporary copy-preservation; virtually nothing modified for solution in substantive terms.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Update sympify function to set evaluate=None unconditionally:\n   ```python\n   sympify(a, locals=None, convert_xor=True, strict=False, rational=False, evaluate=None):\n       evaluate = None  # Ignore the evaluate parameter\n   ```\n   This hunk forces `evaluate` argument to be `None` to yield consistent behaviors and debug alterations from the flag cite.\n2. Addition to sympify docstring making users aware evaluate param:\n   \n   Extensive illustrative and warning segment was carried over:\n   \n   Updated Notice!\n   ```python\n   Concluding line from evaluation:\n   and the `evaluate` parameter is ignored to ensure consistent behavior.\n   ```\n3.

It plays a central role in handling the input conversions and could indirectly affect consistency concerning the `evaluate` parameter.\n- ceiling: Defines the `ceiling` function used within `sympy` to compute the ceiling of both real and complex numbers broadly distil complex inputs to support this.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<hunk_list>\n- Original `sympify.py`:\n```python\ndef sympify(a, locals=None, convert_xor=True, strict=False, rational=False, \n    evaluate=None):\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts an arbitrary expression to a type that can be used inside SymPy.\n    \"\"\"\n- Patched `sympify.py`:\n```python\ndef sympify(a, locals=None, convert_xor=True, strict=False, rational=False, \n    evaluate=None):\n    evaluate = None  # Ignore the evaluate parameter\n\n    \"\"\"\n    Converts an arbitrary expression to a type that can be used inside SymPy.\n    \"\"\"\n```\n- Only the line assigning `evaluate = None` is introduced.\n</hunk_list>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch introduces a modification within the initialization of the `sympify` function. Specifically, adds `evaluate = None`, which effectively disregards any input received through the `evaluate` parameter. The key impact of this change is that the `evaluate` parameter is always nullified, causing consistent treatment of input regardless of its initially passed value.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe issue partially arises from the treatment of the `evaluate` parameter within the `sympify` function. Modifying the relevance of this parameter within `sympify` directly addresses its varying evaluations against expressions, especially those involving `ceiling` functions. Thus, the patch is applied at the correct function to target the underlying problem in this context.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nDespite ensuring the consistent behavior by disregarding the `evaluate` value, it completely eliminates the functionality that supports different evaluations based on the user's input. It modifies the originally flexible infrastructure principle, possibly leading to a broader issue where users cannot now intentionally keep `evaluate=True` for specific helpful expressions.\nAdditionally, none of the typical constraints mentioned around `ceiling` functions directly gets evaluated nor referenced, possibly contradicting indirect dependent operations unchanged elsewhere within attitudes/function arguments linked sympify chainlessly transformation foreseeable compatibility expectations hurt outing.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch introduces specific injections making ignore `evaluate`-null renditions invariably trends attributes conscription.
