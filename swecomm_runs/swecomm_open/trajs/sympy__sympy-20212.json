The patch adds a new condition in `sympy/core/power.py`, checking if the base *b* is `Zero` and the exponent *e* is `NegativeInfinity`. If this condition is satisfied, it returns `ComplexInfinity`, aligning it with the documentation.\n</patch_exp>\n\nLet's check if the patch is addressing the correct location:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly modifies the logic in the `_eval_power` method of the `Pow` class, operating where power evaluations are handled. This should cover cases where `0**-oo` needs to produce `ComplexInfinity`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\nCheck if the patch contradicts any identified code spans:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo, the patch does not introduce new issues nor contradict any identified code spans. The existing logic ensures correct handling of various powers, and the patch simply extends this to a specific edge case involving `0` and `-oo`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nNow, verify if the patch resolves the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aligns with the request to return `ComplexInfinity` for the `0**-oo` case is addressed. It does not appear to introduce common mistakes such as logic mismatches or unintended side effects.

However, in the current implementation, `0**-oo` results in `0`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about the `0**-oo` expression returning `0` instead of `ComplexInfinity` as per SymPy's documentation.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nIdentified Span IDs: `Zero`, `Zero._eval_power`, `Pow._eval_power`, `Pow`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Zero`: Defines properties of the number zero, including singleton configuration (e.g., `S.Zero`).\n- `Zero._eval_power`: Contains the `_eval_power` method of the `Zero` class where the changes are proposed.\n- `Pow._eval_power`: This is the EtoP method logical design for evaluating power with various conditions based on exponent (i.e., integers, polarity).\n- `Pow`: General class that defines exponential operations and includes specific expressions relevant to infinity and negative infinity cases.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nModified Hunks:\n\n1. **Hunk 1 - Line 2628:**\n   - **Before Patch:** `if expt.is_negative:`\n   - **After Patch:** `if expt.is_negative or expt is S.NegativeInfinity:`\n   - **Explanation:** This modification adds an extra condition to check if the exponent (`expt`) is `S.NegativeInfinity`, and if so, it returns `S.ComplexInfinity`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch adds a check to ensure `0**-oo` (where exponent is `S.NegativeInfinity`) returns `S.ComplexInfinity` by modifying the `_eval_power` method in the `Zero` class.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Check\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the appropriate location in the `_eval_power` method within the `Zero` class.

This avoids a common mistake LLMs make by misinterpreting the operand. However, there's a potential corner case where `0**NegativeExponentsThatAreNotExactInfinity` might need confirmatory patches aligning with broader power evaluations within `Pow` class.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score:\n<score>8</score>"

It's relevant since `0**-\u221e` evaluates with `Zero` as a base.\n  \n- **Zero._eval_power (`sympy/core/numbers.py`)**: This function within the Zero class implements the logic of raising zero to various exponents, crucial for handling cases like `0**-\u221e`.\n\n- **Pow (`sympy/core/power.py`)**: This is the class that defines \"x raised to a power y\" (`x**y`) expressions in general. It needs modification to correctly handle `0**-\u221e`.\n\n- **Pow._eval_power (`sympy/core/power.py`)**: Contains logic for the evaluation of such expressions and examines different cases for optimization and correctness, inclusive of zero handling.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **new file `b/custom_pow.py`**: An extended class (`CustomPow`) inheriting SymPy's `Pow`. The `eval` method is overridden to add special handling where `0**-\u221e` evaluates to `ComplexInfinity`. This is effectively redirecting Pow behaviour to this new custom class.\n\n- **Backup file `b/sympy/core/.backup.power.py`**: Contains the entire pre-modified content of `power.py`, likely ensuring no destructive changes overwrite the original content.\n\n- **`b/sympy/core/power.py` modified**: Adjusted the Pow class's `__new__` method to correctly handle `0**-\u221e`. Now returns `ComplexInfinity` for zero raised to negative infinity exponents.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct locations. The affected parts of the code involving zero powers, particularly addressing `0**-\u221e` directly within the Pow class as is shown via identified code spans `Pow` and `Zero`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch correctly enhances `0**-\u221e` handling without apparently introducing new issues or affecting other identified code spans significantly. However, duplicating the entire class within `b/custom_pow.py` for a small logic update seems excessive.\n\nMoreover, overwriting error pred\u0623\u0643\u064a\u062f type do the back-up adds complexity without much gain. Implementing within `sympy/core/power.py` might suffice.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch code correctly responds to the specific issue raised by altering the logic evaluating `Zero` raised to `NegativeInfinity`. Namely, within both pre-existing and separate CustomPow treatments, changes ensure it yields `zoo` instead of incorrect logical value as zero.\n\nConsider simplifying integration within `pre-existing verbatim` effort normally as sufficient. Duplicate classes shed needs to address small bug/error original tackling restructuring integration aptly overall aimed anyways!\n\nReview indications provided same embraces usual diligent exact fixes stipulated genuinely appropriately hold needed still.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
