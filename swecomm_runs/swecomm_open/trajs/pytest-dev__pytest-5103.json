If there are changes in how the assertions are computed or presented, integrations with this function might be impacted.\n6. `AssertionRewriter.visit_Call_35`: Similar to `visit_Call_legacy`, it handles `ast.Call` nodes but for Python versions 3.5 and above, making sure intricate changes are also backward-compatible.\n7. `AssertionRewriter`: This class is central to rewriting assertions to improve error details, thus any distributed mechanism for visiting nodes and generating the reports lies here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Adding `is_all_or_any_call` function (line 609) in `AssertionRewriter` class:**\n   A new method that checks whether a provided call belongs to the built-in `all` or `any` functions and that it takes an iterable like a generator expression or list comprehension as an argument.\n\n2. **Modification to `visit_Call_35` method (line 974):**\n   An `if` condition checking whether the call fits the `all` or `any` criteria by using `is_all_or_any_call` method, and routing these cases to a newly introduced method `visit_all_any_call`. This change ensures that any calls to `all` and `any` will receive custom unrolling treatment.\n\n3. **New method `visit_all_any_call` added (line 1039) in `AssertionRewriter` class:**\n   Introduces specific logic to \"unroll\" the `all` or `any` calls. It sets up the loop necessary to capture individual evaluations and clarify them under ascribed variable state changes, enhancing overall traceability and formatting.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying functions within the `AssertionRewriter` that are responsible for traversing and rewriting the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) during assertion handling. These functions are the appropriate place to introduce adjustments for more informative assertions regarding `all` and `any`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to contradict any specific implementations or details in the code spans. However, it must be checked beyond code-level coherency. Given there\u2019s adequate additional tests and least alterations to the core, breaking integrations can be avoided. Yet respective variable states, context managements, generator-specific nuances, and overall escape contingencies should render out opposing concerns to already defined methods or chess-pieces default patterns.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is correctly aimed at improving error messages for assertions involving `all` and `any` and does so by unrolling the iterable and producing clearer reports. However, possible common issues include:\n1. Performance Overhead: Unrolling iterables, particularly long ones, might convert lightweight evaluations into heavier traced loops.\n2. Context Cloning: Situations having nested iterations might not be optimal if immediate handlings aren't tuned in patch.\n3. Compatibility: Thoroughly check patch efficacy under various python versions due to AST handling evolution.\n   \nThus, spotted checks balanced out rigorously help circumvent these spatinary anomalies confirming constructive development.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Helps in function call handling for modern Python versions in assertions.\n   - `AssertionRewriter`: This class implements the logic for rewriting assertion nodes in AST and is central to any modifications needed to unroll `all` and `any`.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n   **List of Modified Hunks:**\n   - Before/After in file `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` lines 981-1023.\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - The patch adds logic to detect when `all` or `any` functions are used in an assertion and unrolls the iterable into a more explicit for-loop statement:\n     - `new_kwargs` are appended as before with checks for `keyword.arg`.\n     - Original function call is preserved.\n     - Logic is integrated to check if the function (`new_func`) is either `all` or `any`.\n     - It introduces a variable to hold the iterable.\n     - It constructs a loop with a condition based on the function (`all` or `any`) and adds it to the assertions.\n     - Adjusts the result and explanation of the assert operation accordingly to work with the new loop logic for `all`/`any`.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch modifies the `_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` file, where functions responsible for visiting and rewriting function calls in assertion statements are located. Specifically, it enhances the function responsible for handling assertion calls by adding logic to unroll iterables for `all` and `any`, making it the correct location for such a fix.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch introduces new statements in the middle of the call handling, which might mistakenly modify the overall assert logic if mishandled but it appears to be carefully placed with additional variables and correct AST node constructs. Overall it effectively focuses on only `all` and `any` cases without introduction of contradictory errors to existing span logics.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch directly addresses the problem by unrolling the iterable when `all` or `any` is part of the assertion. It constructs a more detailed report by converting the assertion into a loop, checking individual elements as requested. The patch smartly identifies and processes the assertion using AST nodes without apparent mistakes, fixing clearer detailed report output during assertion failures, thus resolving the inadequate reporting issue.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Give me your score**\n\n   <score>10</score>\n"

The default error messages provided by Python are not informative, particularly when the assertion expression is a generator or comprehension. The author requests that these sequences be \"unrolled\" for better error reporting, making them akin to inline for-loops which give more context about the failure.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- AssertionRewritingHook.find_module\n- AssertionRewritingHook\n- AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert\n- AssertionRewriter.visit_Call_legacy\n- _call_reprcompare\n- AssertionRewriter.visit_Call_35\n- AssertionRewriter\n\n1. **AssertionRewritingHook.find_module**:\n   This span is part of the module loader which is concerned about rewriting tests. It figures out if a module should be rewritten. The proposed solution likely involves making asserts within such modules more descriptive by unrolling `all` or `any`.\n   \n2. **AssertionRewritingHook**:\n   Defines the class that provides the import hook used to find modules and rewrite them as necessary, pertinent to how those modules' asserts are rewritten.\n  \n3. **AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert**:\n   This method is responsible for converting assert statements into more detailed and structured alternatives, which is where the \"unrolling\" of `all`/`any` generator or list comprehensions would be implemented.\n  \n4. **AssertionRewriter.visit_Call_legacy**:\n   Code span relevant for calls, ensuring backwards compatibility for Python versions 3.4 and below. This ensures any changes made maintain compatibility across Python versions.\n  \n5. **_call_reprcompare**:\n   Used to compare and represent assertion errors in the existing code. Enhancements to explanation functionality might need updates here if function call behavior and explanations change.\n  \n6. **AssertionRewriter.visit_Call_35**:\n   Used for visits to `ast.Call` nodes specifically on Python 3.5 and later versions. Like `visit_Call_legacy`, it would need to capture how calls are being visited to update for changes caused by unrolling.\n  \n7. **AssertionRewriter**:\n   This is the main class handling assertion rewrites. Its visit methods likely need to account for additional complexities when introducing unrolling into comprehension forms.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **New Method Addition (_unroll_all_any)** in `AssertionRewriter` Class:\n   This method introduces the core logic to unroll `all` or `any` calls by converting generator or list comprehensions inside those calls into a form that would give a more detailed error report.\n\n2. **Integration of _unroll_all_any**:\n    1. Integrated into the `visit_Assert` method before other standard rewrites.\n    2. Placed into the loop and updates in the existing class function logic appropriately to incorporate its new helper for every assert inspection.\n\n3. **Method Characteristics**:\n    - `if isinstance(node, ast.Call) and isinstance(node.func, ast.Name) results in syntax tree satisfaction examining `all` or `any` function whose arguments needed restructuring.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the changes are in the correct location.
