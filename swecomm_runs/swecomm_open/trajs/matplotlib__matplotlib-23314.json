The `draw` method in `axes/_base.py` is responsible for rendering, and placing an additional visibility check here ensures that non-visible axes are not drawn.

This solution, although functional, probably provides a quick fix rather than an elegant and clean one, and the redundancy is not typically advised in production code.\n\nCommon issues with LLM-generated patches include:\n\n1.

Specifically, after calling `_unstale_viewLim()`, another `return` statement is added if `self.get_visible()` is False. This is intended to skip rendering if the axes are marked as not visible.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies `lib/matplotlib/axes/_base.py` to add a second visibility check in `draw`. The check was already done at the beginning but re-checking after `_unstale_viewLim()` might not be directly correlating with how `Axes3D.draw` manages its workflow, which seems unrelated to `_unstale_viewLim()`.\nThe provided code spans indicate that modifications might be more needed in `Axes3D.draw` rather than the base `Axes` class. This is because the rendering procedure is specialized for 3D through overloading/overriding.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch modifies the visibility logic of the core `Axes` class in the base module. This addition can unnecessarily repeat a visibility check that might have consequences and may not effectively address 3D specific issues, leading to incomplete rendering situations.\nIt does not contradict identified code spans but introduces repetitive logic without proper context checks coordinating with `Axes3D` handling/optimizations specifically.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch falls into the common mistake of applying a generalized solution to a base class without factoring in the unique conditions of 3D specific behavior. Fixing the `draw` method of `Axes3D`, where specialized behavior in 3D rendering matters, means that appropriately negotiating `set_visible()` should be handled differently explicitly or within its method confines.\nThe introduced visibility check redundancy is an ineffectual fix here and doesn't directly solve the original context effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>0</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the Issue**:\n   - The issue is described as the `set_visible(False)` method not functioning properly for 3D subplots in Matplotlib (specifically the `Axes3D` class). This method should make the subplot invisible, but in practice, it does not.\n\n   ```issue_exp```\n   The issue is that the `set_visible(False)` method for the `Axes3D` class in Matplotlib does not work correctly\u2014it does not hide 3D subplots as expected, despite being intended to.\n   ```\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**:\n   - **List of Span IDs**: `[\"Axes3D.draw\", \"Axes3D.clear\", \"Axes3D\"]`\n\n   - **Explanations**:\n   \n     ```code_span_exp```\n     - **Span ID `Axes3D.draw`**: This is the `draw` method belonging to the `Axes3D` class. It is responsible for rendering the 3D axes. The method involves drawing the background patch, handling aspects, and drawing child artists.\n     \n     - **Span ID `Axes3D.clear`**: This is the `clear` method of the `Axes3D` class. This method handles clearing the axes' data and resetting the state, preparing the axes to display new data.\n     \n     - **Span ID `Axes3D`**: This code defines the `Axes3D` class itself, ensuring it's instantiated correctly with certain properties. The class itself maintains various methods and properties that dictate how 3D axes behave and render. This context supports modifications to core functionalities within `Axes3D`.\n     ```\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**:\n   - **List of Modified Hunks**: There\u2019s one modified code section in the `axes3d.py` file.\n   \n     ```patch_exp```\n     - In the `draw` method of `Axes3D`, a check is added to exit the method early if the axes are not visible: \n       ```python\n       if not self.get_visible():\n           return\n       ```\n       This modification ensures that if `set_visible(False)` is called, the drawing pipeline is skipped.\n     ```\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function or Not**:\n\n   ```correct_location_exp```\n   Yes, the patch is modifying the `draw` function of the `Axes3D` class, which is appropriate for handling rendering behavior. Adding a visibility check here correctly addresses whether or not the subplot should be drawn.\n   ```\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues**:\n\n   ```new_issues_exp```\n   The patch does not introduce any new issues as it integrates a standard visibility check (common practice) without disrupting existing functionalities or expectations from other parts of the code. Furthermore, it does not contradict the current functionality provided by the `Axes3D` class methods.\n   ```\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue**:\n\n   ```fix_issue_exp```\n   This patch addresses the issue directly by skipping the draw method when the axes are set to be invisible (via `set_visible(False)`). It follows the expected behavior pattern of handling visibility at the start of the draw routine, a common strategy to prevent rendering of unwanted elements, which should effectively resolve the issue described.\n   ```\n\n7. **Score**:\n   \n   This patch checks the visibility state at a key moment in rendering, which is the right approach to fix the problem, without any indications of new bugs or contradictions with existing functionality. The idea fits well with the core issue described.\n\n   <score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that in a 3D subplot created with Matplotlib, the `set_visible()` method does not work as expected. When trying to make a 3D subplot invisible by setting `ax1.set_visible(False)`, the subplot remains visible instead of hiding as intended.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n(1) Axes3D.draw\n(2) Axes3D.clear\n(3) Axes3D\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **Axes3D.draw**: This span contains the draw method of the Axes3D class. The `draw` method is crucial here since it is responsible for rendering the contents of the 3D Axes, and if `set_visible()` is intended to make a subplot invisible, any code added to accomplish that should likely be within or before this rendering logic.\n2. **Axes3D.clear**: This span includes the `clear` method that is used to clear the current Axes state. The relevancy of this span lies in how clearing an Axes retains or interacts with its visibility state.\n3. **Axes3D**: This is the entire class where all relevant methods pertaining to the 3D Axes object are defined. Specific methods in this class (like `draw`) need to consider the visibility attribute, so modifications to address the visibility issue should be reflected here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Changed file: `lib/mpl_toolkits/mplot3d/axes3d.py`\n   - **Hunk 1**:\n     - **Before Patch**:\n       ```python\n       @martist.allow_rasterization\n       def draw(self, renderer):\n           self._unstale_viewLim()\n           ...\n       ```\n     - **After Patch**:\n       ```python\n       @martist.allow_rasterization\n       def draw(self, renderer):\n           if not self.get_visible():\n               return\n           self._unstale_viewLim()\n           ...\n       ```\n\n2. Introduced a return statement in the `draw` method that prevents performing its operations if `self.get_visible()` is `False`.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. By adding a check for `self.get_visible()` within `draw()`, it ensures that if the visibility is set to off, the method returns early and does not render any content of the Axes.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduced does not conflict with the identified spans or introduce any new issues. The logic is straightforward \u2014 it checks if the Axes is set to be invisible and skips the drawing process accordingly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe proposed solution correctly addresses the issue as presented in the description. The function `draw` no longer proceeds to draw the subplot if its visibility is set to `False`, effectively ensuring that the subplot remains hidden when `set_visible(False)` is applied.\nHowever, my concern is whether any additional parts of the 3D Axes might need similar visibility checks; other axes drawing methods (if any) usually do not need to be adjusted unless specified. Since no contradictions or additional concerns are visible, the patch seems valid.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
