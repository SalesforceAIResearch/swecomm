This causes a TypeError because the code attempts to check for a string within an integer, resulting in an \"argument of type 'int' is not iterable\" error.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans**\n\n   - List of Span IDs: `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled`, `AssertionRewriter`, `AssertionRewriter.run`\n\n   - Explanation of each identified code span:\n\n       - `AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled`: This function checks if the assertion rewriting should be disabled based on the presence of a string (\"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\") within the docstring. This is directly relevant because it is the piece of code causing the TypeError when `docstring` is an integer.\n       - `AssertionRewriter`: This class responsible for rewriting assertion statements within a Python module. The issue is within this context, where the first expression being a number gets misinterpreted.\n       - `AssertionRewriter.run`: This method is responsible for iterating through the AST module and finding all assert statements to rewrite them. The problem occurs here when it mistakenly takes the first number as a docstring, expecting it to be processed by `is_rewrite_disabled`.\n\n   <code_span_exp>\n   - AssertionRewriter.is_rewrite_disabled: The method currently checks for a string within the `docstring`, which leads to an issue when the `docstring` is an integer.\n   - AssertionRewriter: The class handling assertion rewriting, where the overall context of the issue is situated.\n   - AssertionRewriter.run: This mechanism processes the AST of the module and looks for assertions. The issue occurs here when it mistakes the number for a docstring and calls `is_rewrite_disabled`.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch**\n\n   - List of modified hunks:\n     ```python\n     if doc is not None and isinstance(doc, str) and self.is_rewrite_disabled(doc)\n     ```\n     ```python\n     return isinstance(docstring, str) and \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in docstring\n     ```\n  \n   - Explanation of each modified hunk:\n\n       - Hunk 1 (`b/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` lines 670-671): The patch adds an `isinstance(doc, str)` check. This ensures that a type check is done to see if `doc` is a string before calling `is_rewrite_disabled`, preventing the `TypeError`.\n       - Hunk 2 (`b/src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py` lines 746): A similar check is introduced in the `is_rewrite_disabled` function, which now explicitly verifies if `docstring` is a string before applying the `in` operation.\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - The first hunk (lines 670-671) adds a type check to ensure `doc` is a string before attempting to determine if assertion rewriting should be disabled.\n   - The second hunk (lines 746) implements a type check within the `is_rewrite_disabled` method ensuring `docstring` is a string before checking for the presence of \"PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE\" in it.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if Patch Fixes Correct Function**\n\n   Yes, the added checks are introduced in the `run` method and `is_rewrite_disabled` method. These are the correct places since they deal directly with the interpretation of docstrings and are responsible for potential misidentification of numbers as docstrings.\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   The patch appropriately fixes the correct locations: `run` method and `is_rewrite_disabled` method of the `AssertionRewriter` class which handle the logic implicated in the described issue.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues**\n    The patch seems to be fixing the specified issue without introducing new issues. Typing checks are an appropriate measure here and logically integrate with the current functionality of the class.\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch does not introduce any new issues and integrates well with the existing logic by appropriately handling type checking to ensure robustness.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Patch Effectiveness**\n\n   The patch effectively resolves the identified issue by ensuring type-checking is implemented before key operations. This aligns well with common checks to prevent the TypeError issue described. Likely mistake categories like incorrect function modifications or logic issues have not been observed here.\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch effectively resolves the issue by implementing type checks to ensure only strings are processed where required, thus preventing the mishandling of numerical values as docstrings. This measures align well with typical solutions to such TypeErrors and does not fall into common mistakes made by LLMs.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

See\n+    http://pybites.blogspot.be/2011/07/behind-scenes-of-pytests-new-assertion.html\n+    for an overview of how this works.\n+\n+    The entry point here is .run() which will iterate over all the\n+    statements in an ast.Module and for each ast.Assert statement it\n+    finds call .visit() with it.  Then .visit_Assert() takes over and\n+    is responsible for creating new ast statements to replace the\n+    original assert statement: it rewrites the test of an assertion\n+    to provide intermediate values and replace it with an if statement\n+    which raises an assertion error with a detailed explanation in\n+    case the expression is false and calls pytest_assertion_pass hook\n+    if expression is true.\n+\n+    For this .visit_Assert() uses the visitor pattern to visit all the\n+    AST nodes of the ast.Assert.test field, each visit call returning\n+    an AST node and the corresponding explanation string.  During this\n+    state is kept in several instance attributes:\n+\n+    :statements: All the AST statements which will replace the assert\n+       statement.\n+\n+    :variables: This is populated by .variable() with each variable\n+       used by the statements so that they can all be set to None at\n+       the end of the statements.\n+\n+    :variable_counter: Counter to create new unique variables needed\n+       by statements.  Variables are created using .variable() and\n+       have the form of \"@py_assert0\".\n+\n+    :expl_stmts: The AST statements which will be executed to get\n+       data from the assertion.  This is the code which will construct\n+       the detailed assertion message that is used in the AssertionError\n+       or for the pytest_assertion_pass hook.\n+\n+    :explanation_specifiers: A dict filled by .explanation_param()\n+       with %-formatting placeholders and their corresponding\n+       expressions to use in the building of an assertion message.\n+       This is used by .pop_format_context() to build a message.\n+\n+    :stack: A stack of the explanation_specifiers dicts maintained by\n+       .push_format_context() and .pop_format_context() which allows\n+       to build another %-formatted string while already building one.\n+\n+    :variables_overwrite: A dict filled with references to variables\n+       that change value within an assert.
