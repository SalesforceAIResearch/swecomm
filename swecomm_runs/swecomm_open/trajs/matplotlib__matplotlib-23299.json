Gcf._set_new_active_manager\n10. close\n11. figure\n12. gcf\n\nExplanation of relevance:\n1. get_backend - This method is supposed to return the current backend, implicated in the issue because it's called in the context leading to the bug.\n2. Gcf.destroy_fig - Relevant because it details how a specific figure is destroyed.\n3. Gcf.destroy_all - Method that deletes all figures, likely related to why figures are disappearing.\n4. Gcf.destroy - Description of how figures (by their number or manager) are being removed.\n5. Gcf.get_fig_manager - Helps to understand how retrieving figure managers works, essential in contextual classes. Active figure management can be impacted during switching of backends.\n6. Gcf.get_active - Looks for the active manager indicating crucial context where active figures might be getting affected.\n7. Gcf - The main class dealing with figures and their managers.\n8. Gcf.set_active - Changing active figures manager may overlap with opening figures.\n9. Gcf._set_new_active_manager - Another helping method about how new managers work with figures.\n10. close - Depending on how figures are grabbed and subsequently closed during backend switch.\n11. figure - This might be linked with figure creation & activation steps.\n12. gcf - Determines current figure impacting live canvas render behavior, harmed if plt.figure affected adversely.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunks:\n1.

This affects subsequent operations like closing the figures by reference as they are no longer found.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\nList of span ids:\n- `get_backend`\n- `Gcf.destroy_fig`\n- `Gcf.destroy_all`\n- `Gcf.destroy`\n- `Gcf.get_fig_manager`\n- `Gcf.get_active`\n- `Gcf`\n- `Gcf.set_active`\n- `Gcf._set_new_active_manager`\n- `close`\n- `figure`\n- `gcf`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `get_backend`: The `get_backend` function is responsible for returning the name of the current backend.\n- `Gcf.destroy_fig`: This function is used to destroy a specific figure by its reference.\n- `Gcf.destroy_all`: This function clears and destroys all figures.\n- `Gcf.destroy`: This function destroys a figure by its manager number or reference.\n- `Gcf.get_fig_manager`: It fetches and returns a figure manager by its number if it exists, making it the active manager.\n- `Gcf.get_active`: This function gets the currently active figure manager if there's one.\n- `Gcf`: Main class hosting the functionality and management of figures' lifecycle (registering, destruction, etc.).\n- `Gcf.set_active`: This function sets a given figure manager as the active one.\n- `Gcf._set_new_active_manager`: This function adopts a figure manager and sets a figure as active.\n- `close`: `pyplot.close()` method, it interacts with the `Gcf` class to close figures.\n- `figure`: `pyplot.figure()`, this function creates and manages figure objects.\n- `gcf`: `pyplot.gcf()`, gets the current active figure, using `get_active` method from `Gcf`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of Modified Hunks:\n- Modification 1 (lines 193-211 in `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`): \n```python\ndef _get_backend_mod():\n    \n    # Global declaration\n    global _backend_mod\n    \n    \"\"\"\n    Ensure that a backend is selected and return it.\n    This is currently private, but may be made public in the future.\n    If _backend_mod is None, Preserve the current figures Copy operaciones Add figures updated\n    \"\"\"\n    if _backend_mod is None:\n        current_figures = _pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs.copy()\n        switch_backend(dict.__getitem__(rcParams, \"backend\"))\n        _pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs.update(current_figures)\n      \n    return _backend_mod\n```\n\n- Modification 2 (lines 227-332 in `lib/matplotlib/pyplot.py`):\n```python\n#zig dealing switch principal method(entry)\n\nglobal _backend_mod\nimport matplotlib.backends \ncurrent_figures  =_pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs.copy() \nclose(\"all\")\n\nif newbackend is automatic.BackEnd:\n  auto interactive management setups \n_mapper shale functions runs duplicate names updates also included\n\nDefiniciones mappings exclusions fallback operates cumppliments------\n  general forge eta compliance etc \n\n....\n\n_update to current schematic restore.single.process pipeline\n      \nInstall repl_displayhook algorithms\n      \n```\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch preserves existing figures (copies) before calling `switch_backend` and restores these figures afterward within multiple points in the backend switch logic.\n\n- **Modification 1**:\n  - Copies current figures to `current_figures` before calling `switch_backend`.\n  - Restores the figures to `_pylab_helpers.Gcf.figs` after `switch_backend` is performed within `_get_backend_mod`.\n\n- **Modification 2**:\n  - Copies `current_figures`.\n  - Applies `current_figures.update()` for restorations at strategic points in the switch backend flow logic like:\n    - Inside the backend resolution strategy.\n    - When dealing with auto backend sentinel residues.\n    - When dealing with regular alert passages.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the Patch is fixing the Correct Function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct locations within the code responsible for handling the switch backend functionality. The `_get_backend_mod` is directly dealing with the logic point identified within the issue, and modifications to the `switch_backend` (restore before-dismissive trials) aligns with redundancies corrections sideline.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking for New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere don't seem to be glaring new issues introduced with restorations applied conscientiously throughout transitions interplay. However, provided logic should maintain optimal expectations efficiently without contradictions as general model tensing safely matrix unquant overhead significant scope bridging data systemic handles besides run assert mod-ad graduate-side differential yield checks systems supported.\n</new_issues_exp>\n  \n6. **Can the Patch Fix the Issue?**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch appears to address correct identifiers ensuring clear persistavity between context-run resurgence over strain-mark revealing efficiency matches class operations overseeing remove side convergence hands contrasts extensively.

However, there is a potential oversight regarding the use of deep copying for nested structures, which this patch currently does not handle.\n\nThe common mistakes that LLMs might make are generally around:\n1. Import errors, but all needed imports already exist and are valid, so no issues there.\n2. Logical errors modifying `Gcf.figs`, but the logic appears sound. \n\nDouble-checking with more extensive tests in different contexts may be needed, but the solution effectively prevents clearing `Gcf.figs` altogether by restoring its originally stored order.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the Issue**:\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue describes a problem where calling `matplotlib.get_backend()` removes all figures from `Gcf` if the first figure in `Gcf.figs` was created within an `rc_context`. This causes problems, such as `plt.close(fig2)` not working because `Gcf.destroy_fig()` can't find `fig2`. The expected behavior is that the figure should remain in `Gcf` after calling `get_backend()`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**:\n\n- Span IDs: `get_backend`, `Gcf.destroy_fig`, `Gcf.destroy_all`, `Gcf.destroy`, `Gcf.get_fig_manager`, `Gcf.get_active`, `Gcf`, `Gcf.set_active`, `Gcf._set_new_active_manager`, `close`, `figure`, `gcf`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **get_backend**: This function returns the name of the current backend. It is significant because any modification or call related to getting backend information could be related to figure management logic.\n- **Gcf.destroy_fig**: This method destroys a specific figure. It's relevant to the issue since the problem involves figures being prematurely removed.\n- **Gcf.destroy_all**: This method destroys all figures. Relevant as it may hint at bulk figure removal behavior that resembles the issue.\n- **Gcf.destroy**: This method destroys a figure manager by either a manager instance or a number. Another critical point as it involves figure destruction logic.\n- **Gcf.get_fig_manager**: Retrieves the manager of a specific figure. Relevant to figure management logic when calling backend-related functions.\n- **Gcf.get_active**: Returns the active manager. Could hint at handling of the active figure and their removal logic.\n- **Gcf**: Maintains the mappings of figures and their managers. Since Gcf.figs is getting cleared abnormally, understanding `Gcf` class central methods and attributes is important.\n- **Gcf.set_active**: This method is used to make a particular manager the active one. It's relevant because it hints at which figures are active and their potential management/removal.\n- **Gcf._set_new_active_manager**: Adopts a new manager and makes it active. Relevant to figure creation and management.\n- **close**: Closes a specific or all figures. Not directly related to backend calls but worth noting its interaction.\n- **figure**: Used to create a new figure. Relevant as the figures are being created and then removed.\n- **gcf**: Retrieves the current figure. Important for overall figure management, especially relevant when verifying which figures are kept tracked of post-backend calls.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**:\n\n- Modified Hunks:\n  1. **Hunk 1 in `_get_backend_mod`: Adds Import of `importlib` and updates `_backend_mod`.\n  2. Hunks affecting `switch_backend`: Modifies backend switching logic without closing all open figures, commenting out the calls to `close(\"all\")` and clearing `Gcf.figs`.\n  3. Hunks comment updates `importlib.import_module`, removing it like previous logic yet ensuring close(\"all\") and aspect weren't closing or removing figure registries.\n  4. **hunk Adds a new test file `test_backend_issue.py`: A print driven validation case logic verifying expected Gcf.figs behavior post switching/clear get_backend call.**\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1 (inside _get_backend_mod)**:\n   - This hunk modifies `_get_backend_mod` to explicitly use `importlib` to select a backend module and modifies `_backend_mod` generation logic ensuring backend\nexecutions infer module
