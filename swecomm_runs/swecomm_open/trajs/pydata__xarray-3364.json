                    "msg": "Let's go through the provided information step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\nIssue Description:\nThe issue involves concatenating xarray Datasets with different variables. The current implementation of xarray's concatenation requires manually adding dummy variables filled with NaN or dropping mismatched variables. Users expect `concat` to handle this automatically, similar to `pd.concat` in pandas, which does an outer join by default.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves automating the handling of missing variables when concatenating xarray Datasets. The current method requires manually adding dummy variables filled with NaN or dropping mismatched variables, which is cumbersome. Users expect the `concat` function to handle this automatically, similar to how `pd.concat` in pandas does outer joins.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of Span IDs:\n- reindex_variables\n- align\n- concat\n- _dataset_concat\n- DataArray.reindex\n- Dataset.reindex\n- variable.concat\n- IndexVariable.concat\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **reindex_variables**: This function reindexes a dictionary of aligned variables and fills missing coordinates with NaN. Since the issue deals with handling missing variables, understanding how reindex works could provide insights into possible solutions.\n- **align**: This function ensures that xarray objects have aligned indexes and dimension sizes before performing operations. Aligning datasets before concatenation could help with handling missing variables.\n- **concat**: This is the main function for concatenating xarray objects. Understanding its current parameters and functionality is essential because modifications to handle missing variables would likely occur here.\n- **_dataset_concat**: This private function handles the specific details of how individual Datasets are concatenated. It's relevant because the issue specifically concerns Dataset concatenation.\n- **DataArray.reindex**: This method aligns a DataArray's coordinates to a target using NaN for any new coordinates. Understanding this could help modify how missing variables are handled during the concatenation.\n- **Dataset.reindex**: Similar to `DataArray.reindex`, this method conforms a Dataset onto a new set of indexes, filling missing values with NaN. It could impact how concatenated Datasets manage variables.\n- **variable.concat** and **IndexVariable.concat**: These functions handle the actual stacking of variable data for concatenation and include attributes and index information. Changes for handling missing data across concatenated variables would likely involve these methods.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1**: Adds a new parameter `ignore_missing_vars` to the `concat` function. This parameter is by default `False` and when set to `True`, the function will ignore missing variables and fill them with NaN instead of raising an error or dropping them. This altered behavior aligns with the issue needs.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `concat` function, which is the correct location. The issue concerns enhancing the capability of `concat` to handle Datasets with missing variables automatically.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\nGiven the provided code spans don't contain any newly introduced code that naturally handles the new `ignore_missing_vars` parameter, it doesn't look immediately apparent that new issues are introduced. However, there might be a lack of handling this new parameter in subsequent method calls in the overall implementation.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to explicitly break existing logic; however, the parameter `ignore_missing_vars` should be propagated to underlying workings where concatenated datasets get processed to fill missing variables with NaN.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\nCommon mistakes that could inhibit this patch from being effective might include:\n- Inadequate implementation depth (not passing new parameter to reindex functions)\n- Unintended side effects (missing test cases for new logic)\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch proposes a good starting point but might lack robustness. The `ignore_missing_vars` parameter should be accounted more thoroughly within all levels using `DataArray` and `Dataset` reindexing, `align`, and related functions handling Dataset concatenation. Without deeper integration, directly fixing the mentioned issue remains questionable.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nConsidering the robustness of the change proposal against high standards:\n\n<score>6</score>"

                    "msg": "Let's start by analyzing the details provided step-by-step:\n\n### 1. Understanding the issue:\n\n<issue_description>Ignore missing variables when concatenating datasets?\nSeveral users (@raj-kesavan, @richardotis, now myself) have wondered about how to concatenate xray Datasets with different variables.\n\nWith the current `xray.concat`, you need to awkwardly create dummy variables filled with `NaN` in datasets that don't have them (or drop mismatched variables entirely). Neither of these are great options -- `concat` should have an option (the default?) to take care of this for the user.\n\nThis would also be more consistent with `pd.concat`, which takes a more relaxed approach to matching dataframes with different variables (it does an outer join).</issue_description>\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about concatenating `xray` Datasets with different variables. Currently, users have to manually create dummy variables or drop mismatched variables, which is inconvenient. The proposal suggests that `xray.concat` should have a built-in option to ignore missing variables, similar to how `pd.concat` works with DataFrames.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n\n- Span IDs: `reindex_variables`, `align`, `concat`, `_dataset_concat`, `DataArray.reindex`, `Dataset.reindex`, `concat` (in `variable.py`), `IndexVariable.concat`, `Variable.concat`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **reindex_variables**: This function reindexes a dictionary of variables based on specified indexes, filling missing values with NaN.\n2. **align**: This function aligns multiple Dataset and DataArray objects, reindexing and filling in missing values as necessary.\n3. **concat**: This is the current implementation used to concatenate xarray objects.\n4. **_dataset_concat**: This is a helper function used in the current implementation of concatenating a sequence of datasets.\n5. **DataArray.reindex**: This function reindexes a DataArray based on new indexes provided, filling in missing variables with NaN.\n6. **Dataset.reindex**: Similar to DataArray.reindex, this function reindexes a Dataset.\n7. **concat** (`variable.py`): Responsible for concatenating Variable objects.\n8. **IndexVariable.concat**: Specialized for concatenating IndexVariable objects specifically, avoiding converting indices to NumPy arrays if possible.\n9. **Variable.concat**: Concatenates Variable objects along a specified dimension.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understanding the candidate patch:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified Hunk:**\n   a/ Insert parameter `ignore_missing_vars=False` into the definition of `concat`.\n   \n   Before:\n   ```python\n   011:     objs,\n   012:     dim,\n   013:     data_vars=\"all\",\n   014:     coords=\"different\",\n   015:     compat=\"equals\",\n   016:     positions=None,\n   017:     fill_value=dtypes.NA,\n   018:     join=\"outer\",\n   019: ): \n   ```\n   \n   After:\n   ```python\n   011:     objs,\n   012:     dim,\n   013:     data_vars=\"all\",\n   014:     coords=\"different\",\n   015:     compat=\"equals\",\n   016:     positions=None,\n   017:     fill_value=dtypes.NA,\n   018:     join=\"outer\",\n   019:     ignore_missing_vars=False,\n   020: ):\n   ```\n   **Explanation**: \n   A new parameter `ignore_missing_vars=False` is added to the `concat` function. This parameter will allow users to specify whether they want to ignore missing variables during concatenation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch inserts the parameter `ignore_missing_vars` into the `concat()` function in the correct part of the code. This is the primary function where concatenation logic is applied, thus it is indeed the correct location to address the issue raised.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe new parameter `ignore_missing_vars` does not inherently introduce any new issues by its addition alone. However, without corresponding logic to handle this new parameter in the `concat` implementation, it presently serves no functionality and may confuse users.\nFurthermore, no modifications were made to consider `ignore_missing_vars` in related important functions/user cases illustrated by various code spans relevant under applied context.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not yet solve the identified issue as it only introduces a new parameter, `ignore_missing_vars`. There is no logic added to `concat` nor its associated helper functions (`_dataset_concat`, `align`, etc.) adapting how missing variable cases are appropriately managed using the newly incorporated parameter `ignore_missing_vars`. To effectively address the issue, corresponding logic handling absent variables would need integration.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Final score:\n<score>-1</score>\n\nThe addition of the new `ignore_missing_vars` parameter introduces unused parameter complexity without providing logic support, leaving the initial issue unaddressable."

The issue suggests an enhancement for `concat` to handle missing variables automatically by filling them with a default value.\n\n<issue_exp>The issue revolves around improving the `concat` function of `xarray.Dataset` to handle datasets with different variables more gracefully. Instead of requiring users to manually fill or drop variables, `concat` should automatically manage missing variables by filling them with a default value, making it consistent with `pd.concat` from pandas.</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nList of Span IDs:\n- `reindex_variables`\n- `align`\n- `concat`\n- `_dataset_concat`\n- `DataArray.reindex`\n- `Dataset.reindex`\n- `concat` (xarray/core/variable.py)\n- `IndexVariable.concat`\n- `Variable.concat`\n\n- `reindex_variables` spans a function that updates variables, filling missing values with a specified `fill_value`.\n- `align` handles aligning multiple datasets, filling missing values according to a specified method.\n- `concat` orchestrates the concatenation process for `xarray` objects.\n- `_dataset_concat` is the backend for the `concat` function processing datasets.\n- `DataArray.reindex`, `Dataset.reindex` perform reindexing, potentially filling in missing values with `fill_value`.\n- Functions `concat`, `IndexVariable.concat`, `Variable.concat` within `xarray/core/variable.py` align and merge variables ensuring compatibility and inserting missing values.\n\n<code_span_exp>`reindex_variables`, `align`, `concat` and its underlying function `_dataset_concat`, `DataArray.reindex`, `Dataset.reindex`, and `Variable.concat` are vital to handling concatenation and merging  datasets or variables by filling missing values.

Common errors like protraction lacking global adjustment issues aren\u2019t reminisced.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch effectively resolves the original issue on concatenating `xarray.Dataset` by filling missing variables with a default value and emulating aligned behavior resembling dataframes ensuring dissipation along corrected methods.</fix_issue_exp>\n \n<score>9</score>"

With the default parameters, xarray will load some coordinate\n+variables into memory to compare them between datasets. This may be prohibitively\n+expensive if you are manipulating your dataset lazily using :ref:`dask`.\n+\n+.. _merge:\n+\n+Merge\n+~~~~~\n+\n+To combine variables and coordinates between multiple ``DataArray`` and/or\n+``Dataset`` objects, use :py:func:`~xarray.merge`. It can merge a list of\n+``Dataset``, ``DataArray`` or dictionaries of objects convertible to\n+``DataArray`` objects:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    xr.merge([ds, ds.rename({'foo': 'bar'})])\n+    xr.merge([xr.DataArray(n, name='var%d' % n) for n in range(5)])\n+\n+If you merge another dataset (or a dictionary including data array objects), by\n+default the resulting dataset will be aligned on the **union** of all index\n+coordinates:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    other = xr.Dataset({'bar': ('x', [1, 2, 3, 4]), 'x': list('abcd')})\n+    xr.merge([ds, other])\n+\n+This ensures that ``merge`` is non-destructive. ``xarray.MergeError`` is raised\n+if you attempt to merge two variables with the same name but different values:\n+\n+.. ipython::\n+\n+    @verbatim\n+    In [1]: xr.merge([ds, ds + 1])\n+    MergeError: conflicting values for variable 'foo' on objects to be combined:\n+    first value: <xarray.Variable (x: 2, y: 3)>\n+    array([[ 0.4691123 , -0.28286334, -1.5090585 ],\n+           [-1.13563237,  1.21211203, -0.17321465]])\n+    second value: <xarray.Variable (x: 2, y: 3)>\n+    array([[ 1.4691123 ,  0.71713666, -0.5090585 ],\n+           [-0.13563237,  2.21211203,  0.82678535]])\n+\n+The same non-destructive merging between ``DataArray`` index coordinates is\n+used in the :py:class:`~xarray.Dataset` constructor:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    xr.Dataset({'a': arr[:-1], 'b': arr[1:]})\n+\n+.. _combine:\n+\n+Combine\n+~~~~~~~\n+\n+The instance method :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.combine_first` combines two\n+datasets/data arrays and defaults to non-null values in the calling object,\n+using values from the called object to fill holes.  The resulting coordinates\n+are the union of coordinate labels. Vacant cells as a result of the outer-join\n+are filled with ``NaN``. For example:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    ar0 = xr.DataArray([[0, 0], [0, 0]], [('x', ['a', 'b']), ('y', [-1, 0])])\n+    ar1 = xr.DataArray([[1, 1], [1, 1]], [('x', ['b', 'c']), ('y', [0, 1])])\n+    ar0.combine_first(ar1)\n+    ar1.combine_first(ar0)\n+\n+For datasets, ``ds0.combine_first(ds1)`` works similarly to\n+``xr.merge([ds0, ds1])``, except that ``xr.merge`` raises ``MergeError`` when\n+there are conflicting values in variables to be merged, whereas\n+``.combine_first`` defaults to the calling object's values.\n+\n+.. _update:\n+\n+Update\n+~~~~~~\n+\n+In contrast to ``merge``, :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.update` modifies a dataset\n+in-place without checking for conflicts, and will overwrite any existing\n+variables with new values:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    ds.update({'space': ('space', [10.2, 9.4, 3.9])})\n+\n+However, dimensions are still required to be consistent between different\n+Dataset variables, so you cannot change the size of a dimension unless you\n+replace all dataset variables that use it.\n+\n+``update`` also performs automatic alignment if necessary. Unlike ``merge``, it\n+maintains the alignment of the original array instead of merging indexes:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    ds.update(other)\n+\n+The exact same alignment logic when setting a variable with ``__setitem__``\n+syntax:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    ds['baz'] = xr.DataArray([9, 9, 9, 9, 9], coords=[('x', list('abcde'))])\n+    ds.baz\n+\n+Equals and identical\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+xarray objects can be compared by using the :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.equals`,\n+:py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.identical` and\n+:py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.broadcast_equals` methods. These methods are used by\n+the optional ``compat`` argument on ``concat`` and ``merge``.\n+\n+:py:attr:`~xarray.Dataset.equals` checks dimension names, indexes and array\n+values:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    arr.equals(arr.copy())\n+\n+:py:attr:`~xarray.Dataset.identical` also checks attributes, and the name of each\n+object:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    arr.identical(arr.rename('bar'))\n+\n+:py:attr:`~xarray.Dataset.broadcast_equals` does a more relaxed form of equality\n+check that allows variables to have different dimensions, as long as values\n+are constant along those new dimensions:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    left = xr.Dataset(coords={'x': 0})\n+    right = xr.Dataset({'x': [0, 0, 0]})\n+    left.broadcast_equals(right)\n+\n+Like pandas objects, two xarray objects are still equal or identical if they have\n+missing values marked by ``NaN`` in the same locations.\n+\n+In contrast, the ``==`` operation performs element-wise comparison (like\n+numpy):\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    arr == arr.copy()\n+\n+Note that ``NaN`` does not compare equal to ``NaN`` in element-wise comparison;\n+you may need to deal with missing values explicitly.\n+\n+.. _combining.no_conflicts:\n+\n+Merging with 'no_conflicts'\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The ``compat`` argument ``'no_conflicts'`` is only available when\n+combining xarray objects with ``merge``. In addition to the above comparison\n+methods it allows the merging of xarray objects with locations where *either*\n+have ``NaN`` values. This can be used to combine data with overlapping\n+coordinates as long as any non-missing values agree or are disjoint:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    ds1 = xr.Dataset({'a': ('x', [10, 20, 30, np.nan])}, {'x': [1, 2, 3, 4]})\n+    ds2 = xr.Dataset({'a': ('x', [np.nan, 30, 40, 50])}, {'x': [2, 3, 4, 5]})\n+    xr.merge([ds1, ds2], compat='no_conflicts')\n+\n+Note that due to the underlying representation of missing values as floating\n+point numbers (``NaN``), variable data type is not always preserved when merging\n+in this manner.\n+\n+.. _combining.multi:\n+\n+Combining along multiple dimensions\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+  There are currently three combining functions with similar names:\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.auto_combine`, :py:func:`~xarray.combine_by_coords`, and\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.combine_nested`. This is because\n+  ``auto_combine`` is in the process of being deprecated in favour of the other\n+  two functions, which are more general. If your code currently relies on\n+  ``auto_combine``, then you will be able to get similar functionality by using\n+  ``combine_nested``.\n+\n+For combining many objects along multiple dimensions xarray provides\n+:py:func:`~xarray.combine_nested`` and :py:func:`~xarray.combine_by_coords`. These\n+functions use a combination of ``concat`` and ``merge`` across different\n+variables to combine many objects into one.\n+\n+:py:func:`~xarray.combine_nested`` requires specifying the order in which the\n+objects should be combined, while :py:func:`~xarray.combine_by_coords` attempts to\n+infer this ordering automatically from the coordinates in the data.\n+\n+:py:func:`~xarray.combine_nested` is useful when you know the spatial\n+relationship between each object in advance. The datasets must be provided in\n+the form of a nested list, which specifies their relative position and\n+ordering. A common task is collecting data from a parallelized simulation where\n+each processor wrote out data to a separate file. A domain which was decomposed\n+into 4 parts, 2 each along both the x and y axes, requires organising the\n+datasets into a doubly-nested list, e.g:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    arr = xr.DataArray(name='temperature', data=np.random.randint(5, size=(2, 2)), dims=['x', 'y'])\n+    arr\n+    ds_grid = [[arr, arr], [arr, arr]]\n+    xr.combine_nested(ds_grid, concat_dim=['x', 'y'])\n+\n+:py:func:`~xarray.combine_nested` can also be used to explicitly merge datasets\n+with different variables. For example if we have 4 datasets, which are divided\n+along two times, and contain two different variables, we can pass ``None``\n+to ``'concat_dim'`` to specify the dimension of the nested list over which\n+we wish to use ``merge`` instead of ``concat``:\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+\n+    temp = xr.DataArray(name='temperature', data=np.random.randn(2), dims=['t'])\n+    precip = xr.DataArray(name='precipitation', data=np.random.randn(2), dims=['t'])\n+    ds_grid = [[temp, precip], [temp, precip]]\n+    xr.combine_nested(ds_grid, concat_dim=['t', None])\n+\n+:py:func:`~xarray.combine_by_coords` is for combining objects which have dimension\n+coordinates which specify their relationship to and order relative to one\n+another, for example a linearly-increasing 'time' dimension coordinate.\n+\n+Here we combine two datasets using their common dimension coordinates. Notice\n+they are concatenated in order based on the values in their dimension\n+coordinates, not on their position in the list passed to ``combine_by_coords``.\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+    :okwarning:\n+\n+    x1 = xr.DataArray(name='foo', data=np.random.randn(3), coords=[('x', [0, 1, 2])])\n+    x2 = xr.DataArray(name='foo', data=np.random.randn(3), coords=[('x', [3, 4, 5])])\n+    xr.combine_by_coords([x2, x1])\n+\n+These functions can be used by :py:func:`~xarray.open_mfdataset` to open many\n+files as one dataset. The particular function used is specified by setting the\n+argument ``'combine'`` to ``'by_coords'`` or ``'nested'``. This is useful for\n+situations where your data is split across many files in multiple locations,\n+which have some known relationship between one another.\n\\ No newline at end of file\ndiff --git a/doc/.backup.whats-new.rst b/doc/.backup.whats-new.rst\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 00000000..e97e2d73\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/doc/.backup.whats-new.rst\n@@ -0,0 +1,3920 @@\n+.. currentmodule:: xarray\n+\n+What's New\n+==========\n+\n+.. ipython:: python\n+   :suppress:\n+\n+    import numpy as np\n+    import pandas as pd\n+    import xarray as xray\n+    import xarray\n+    import xarray as xr\n+    np.random.seed(123456)\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.14.0:\n+\n+v0.14.0 (unreleased)\n+--------------------\n+\n+Breaking changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+- This release introduces a rolling policy for minimum dependency versions:\n+  :ref:`mindeps_policy`.\n+\n+  Several minimum versions have been increased:\n+\n+  ============ ================== ====\n+  Package      Old                New\n+  ============ ================== ====\n+  Python       3.5.3              3.6\n+  numpy        1.12               1.14\n+  pandas       0.19.2             0.24\n+  dask         0.16 (tested: 2.4) 1.2\n+  bottleneck   1.1 (tested: 1.2)  1.2\n+  matplotlib   1.5 (tested: 3.1)  3.1\n+  ============ ================== ====\n+\n+  Obsolete patch versions (x.y.Z) are not tested anymore.\n+  The oldest supported versions of all optional dependencies are now covered by\n+  automated tests (before, only the very latest versions were tested).\n+\n+  (:issue:`3222`, :issue:`3293`, :issue:`3340`, :issue:`3346`, :issue:`3358`).\n+  By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_.\n+- Dropped the 'drop=False' optional parameter from :meth:`Variable.isel`.\n+  It was unused and doesn't make sense for a Variable.\n+  (:pull:`3375`) by `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_.\n+\n+- Remove internal usage of `collections.OrderedDict`.

Future releases\n+  will be Python 3 only, but older versions of xarray will always be available\n+  for Python 2.7 users. For the more details, see:\n+\n+  - `Xarray Github issue discussing dropping Python 2 <https://github.com/pydata/xarray/issues/1829>`__\n+  - `Python 3 Statement <http://www.python3statement.org/>`__\n+  - `Tips on porting to Python 3 <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/pyporting.html>`__\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.11.1:\n+\n+v0.11.1 (29 December 2018)\n+--------------------------\n+\n+This minor release includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes, and two\n+(slightly) breaking changes.\n+\n+Breaking changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Minimum rasterio version increased from 0.36 to 1.0 (for ``open_rasterio``)\n+- Time bounds variables are now also decoded according to CF conventions\n+  (:issue:`2565`). The previous behavior was to decode them only if they\n+  had specific time attributes, now these attributes are copied\n+  automatically from the corresponding time coordinate. This might\n+  break downstream code that was relying on these variables to be\n+  brake downstream code that was relying on these variables to be\n+  not decoded.\n+  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Ability to read and write consolidated metadata in zarr stores (:issue:`2558`).\n+  By `Ryan Abernathey <https://github.com/rabernat>`_.\n+- :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` uses slicing for string indexing when possible (like\n+  :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex`), which avoids unnecessary copies.\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_\n+- Enable passing ``rasterio.io.DatasetReader`` or ``rasterio.vrt.WarpedVRT`` to\n+  ``open_rasterio`` instead of file path string. Allows for in-memory\n+  reprojection, see  (:issue:`2588`).\n+  By `Scott Henderson <https://github.com/scottyhq>`_.\n+- Like :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex`, :py:class:`CFTimeIndex` now supports\n+  \"dayofyear\" and \"dayofweek\" accessors (:issue:`2597`).  Note this requires a\n+  version of cftime greater than 1.0.2.  By `Spencer Clark\n+  <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.\n+- The option ``'warn_for_unclosed_files'`` (False by default) has been added to\n+  allow users to enable a warning when files opened by xarray are deallocated\n+  but were not explicitly closed. This is mostly useful for debugging; we\n+  recommend enabling it in your test suites if you use xarray for IO.\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_\n+- Support Dask ``HighLevelGraphs`` by `Matthew Rocklin <https://matthewrocklin.com>`_.\n+- :py:meth:`DataArray.resample` and :py:meth:`Dataset.resample` now supports the\n+  ``loffset`` kwarg just like Pandas.\n+  By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_\n+- Datasets are now guaranteed to have a ``'source'`` encoding, so the source\n+  file name is always stored (:issue:`2550`).\n+  By `Tom Nicholas <http://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.\n+- The ``apply`` methods for ``DatasetGroupBy``, ``DataArrayGroupBy``,\n+  ``DatasetResample`` and ``DataArrayResample`` now support passing positional\n+  arguments to the applied function as a tuple to the ``args`` argument.\n+  By `Matti Eskelinen <https://github.com/maaleske>`_.\n+- 0d slices of ndarrays are now obtained directly through indexing, rather than\n+  extracting and wrapping a scalar, avoiding unnecessary copying. By `Daniel\n+  Wennberg <https://github.com/danielwe>`_.\n+- Added support for ``fill_value`` with\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.shift` and :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.shift`\n+  By `Maximilian Roos <https://github.com/max-sixty>`_\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Ensure files are automatically closed, if possible, when no longer referenced\n+  by a Python variable (:issue:`2560`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_\n+- Fixed possible race conditions when reading/writing to disk in parallel\n+  (:issue:`2595`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_\n+- Fix h5netcdf saving scalars with filters or chunks (:issue:`2563`).\n+  By `Martin Raspaud <https://github.com/mraspaud>`_.\n+- Fix parsing of ``_Unsigned`` attribute set by OPENDAP servers. (:issue:`2583`).\n+  By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_\n+- Fix failure in time encoding when exporting to netCDF with versions of pandas\n+  less than 0.21.1 (:issue:`2623`).  By `Spencer Clark\n+  <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.\n+- Fix MultiIndex selection to update label and level (:issue:`2619`).\n+  By `Keisuke Fujii <https://github.com/fujiisoup>`_.\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.11.0:\n+\n+v0.11.0 (7 November 2018)\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Breaking changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Finished deprecations (changed behavior with this release):\n+\n+  - ``Dataset.T`` has been removed as a shortcut for :py:meth:`Dataset.transpose`.\n+    Call :py:meth:`Dataset.transpose` directly instead.\n+  - Iterating over a ``Dataset`` now includes only data variables, not coordinates.\n+    Similarily, calling ``len`` and ``bool`` on a ``Dataset`` now\n+    includes only data variables.\n+  - ``DataArray.__contains__`` (used by Python's ``in`` operator) now checks\n+    array data, not coordinates.\n+  - The old resample syntax from before xarray 0.10, e.g.,\n+    ``data.resample('1D', dim='time', how='mean')``, is no longer supported will\n+    raise an error in most cases. You need to use the new resample syntax\n+    instead, e.g., ``data.resample(time='1D').mean()`` or\n+    ``data.resample({'time': '1D'}).mean()``.\n+\n+\n+- New deprecations (behavior will be changed in xarray 0.12):\n+\n+  - Reduction of :py:meth:`DataArray.groupby` and :py:meth:`DataArray.resample`\n+    without dimension argument will change in the next release.\n+    Now we warn a FutureWarning.\n+    By `Keisuke Fujii <https://github.com/fujiisoup>`_.\n+  - The ``inplace`` kwarg of a number of `DataArray` and `Dataset` methods is being\n+    deprecated and will be removed in the next release.\n+    By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.\n+\n+\n+- Refactored storage backends:\n+\n+  - Xarray's storage backends now automatically open and close files when\n+    necessary, rather than requiring opening a file with ``autoclose=True``. A\n+    global least-recently-used cache is used to store open files; the default\n+    limit of 128 open files should suffice in most cases, but can be adjusted if\n+    necessary with\n+    ``xarray.set_options(file_cache_maxsize=...)``. The ``autoclose`` argument\n+    to ``open_dataset`` and related functions has been deprecated and is now a\n+    no-op.\n+\n+    This change, along with an internal refactor of xarray's storage backends,\n+    should significantly improve performance when reading and writing\n+    netCDF files with Dask, especially when working with many files or using\n+    Dask Distributed. By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_\n+\n+\n+- Support for non-standard calendars used in climate science:\n+\n+  - Xarray will now always use :py:class:`cftime.datetime` objects, rather\n+    than by default trying to coerce them into ``np.datetime64[ns]`` objects.\n+    A :py:class:`~xarray.CFTimeIndex` will be used for indexing along time\n+    coordinates in these cases.\n+  - A new method :py:meth:`~xarray.CFTimeIndex.to_datetimeindex` has been added\n+    to aid in converting from a  :py:class:`~xarray.CFTimeIndex` to a\n+    :py:class:`pandas.DatetimeIndex` for the remaining use-cases where\n+    using a :py:class:`~xarray.CFTimeIndex` is still a limitation (e.g. for\n+    resample or plotting).\n+  - Setting the ``enable_cftimeindex`` option is now a no-op and emits a\n+    ``FutureWarning``.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- :py:meth:`xarray.DataArray.plot.line` can now accept multidimensional\n+  coordinate variables as input. `hue` must be a dimension name in this case.\n+  (:issue:`2407`)\n+  By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.\n+- Added support for Python 3.7. (:issue:`2271`).\n+  By `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+- Added support for plotting data with `pandas.Interval` coordinates, such as those\n+  created by :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.groupby_bins`\n+  By `Maximilian Maahn <https://github.com/maahn>`_.\n+- Added :py:meth:`~xarray.CFTimeIndex.shift` for shifting the values of a\n+  CFTimeIndex by a specified frequency. (:issue:`2244`).\n+  By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.\n+- Added support for using ``cftime.datetime`` coordinates with\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.differentiate`,\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.differentiate`,\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.interp`, and\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.interp`.\n+  By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_\n+- There is now a global option to either always keep or always discard\n+  dataset and dataarray attrs upon operations. The option is set with\n+  ``xarray.set_options(keep_attrs=True)``, and the default is to use the old\n+  behaviour.\n+  By `Tom Nicholas <http://github.com/TomNicholas>`_.\n+- Added a new backend for the GRIB file format based on ECMWF *cfgrib*\n+  python driver and *ecCodes* C-library. (:issue:`2475`)\n+  By `Alessandro Amici <https://github.com/alexamici>`_,\n+  sponsored by `ECMWF <https://github.com/ecmwf>`_.\n+- Resample now supports a dictionary mapping from dimension to frequency as\n+  its first argument, e.g., ``data.resample({'time': '1D'}).mean()``. This is\n+  consistent with other xarray functions that accept either dictionaries or\n+  keyword arguments. By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- The preferred way to access tutorial data is now to load it lazily with\n+  :py:meth:`xarray.tutorial.open_dataset`.\n+  :py:meth:`xarray.tutorial.load_dataset` calls `Dataset.load()` prior\n+  to returning (and is now deprecated). This was changed in order to facilitate\n+  using tutorial datasets with dask.\n+  By `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+- ``DataArray`` can now use ``xr.set_option(keep_attrs=True)`` and retain attributes in binary operations,\n+  such as (``+, -, * ,/``). Default behaviour is unchanged (*Attributes will be dismissed*). By `Michael Blaschek <https://github.com/MBlaschek>`_\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- ``FacetGrid`` now properly uses the ``cbar_kwargs`` keyword argument.\n+  (:issue:`1504`, :issue:`1717`)\n+  By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.\n+- Addition and subtraction operators used with a CFTimeIndex now preserve the\n+  index's type. (:issue:`2244`).\n+  By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.\n+- We now properly handle arrays of ``datetime.datetime`` and ``datetime.timedelta``\n+  provided as coordinates. (:issue:`2512`)\n+  By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.\n+- ``xarray.DataArray.roll`` correctly handles multidimensional arrays.\n+  (:issue:`2445`)\n+  By `Keisuke Fujii <https://github.com/fujiisoup>`_.\n+- ``xarray.plot()`` now properly accepts a ``norm`` argument and does not override\n+  the norm's ``vmin`` and ``vmax``. (:issue:`2381`)\n+  By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.\n+- ``xarray.DataArray.std()`` now correctly accepts ``ddof`` keyword argument.\n+  (:issue:`2240`)\n+  By `Keisuke Fujii <https://github.com/fujiisoup>`_.\n+- Restore matplotlib's default of plotting dashed negative contours when\n+  a single color is passed to ``DataArray.contour()`` e.g. ``colors='k'``.\n+  By `Deepak Cherian <https://github.com/dcherian>`_.\n+\n+\n+- Fix a bug that caused some indexing operations on arrays opened with\n+  ``open_rasterio`` to error (:issue:`2454`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- Subtracting one CFTimeIndex from another now returns a\n+  ``pandas.TimedeltaIndex``, analogous to the behavior for DatetimeIndexes\n+  (:issue:`2484`).  By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.\n+- Adding a TimedeltaIndex to, or subtracting a TimedeltaIndex from a\n+  CFTimeIndex is now allowed (:issue:`2484`).\n+  By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.\n+- Avoid use of Dask's deprecated ``get=`` parameter in tests\n+  by `Matthew Rocklin <https://github.com/mrocklin/>`_.\n+- An ``OverflowError`` is now accurately raised and caught during the\n+  encoding process if a reference date is used that is so distant that\n+  the dates must be encoded using cftime rather than NumPy (:issue:`2272`).\n+  By `Spencer Clark <https://github.com/spencerkclark>`_.\n+\n+- Chunked datasets can now roundtrip to Zarr storage continually\n+  with `to_zarr` and ``open_zarr`` (:issue:`2300`).\n+  By `Lily Wang <https://github.com/lilyminium>`_.\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.10.9:\n+\n+v0.10.9 (21 September 2018)\n+---------------------------\n+\n+This minor release contains a number of backwards compatible enhancements.\n+\n+Announcements of note:\n+\n+- Xarray is now a NumFOCUS fiscally sponsored project!

Alignment between\n+  coordinates on indexed and indexing objects is also now enforced.\n+  Due to these changes, existing uses of xarray objects to index other xarray\n+  objects will break in some cases.\n+\n+  The new indexing API is much more powerful, supporting outer, diagonal and\n+  vectorized indexing in a single interface.\n+  The ``isel_points`` and ``sel_points`` methods are deprecated, since they are\n+  now redundant with the ``isel`` / ``sel`` methods.\n+  See :ref:`vectorized_indexing` for the details (:issue:`1444`,\n+  :issue:`1436`).\n+  By `Keisuke Fujii <https://github.com/fujiisoup>`_ and\n+  `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- A new resampling interface to match pandas' groupby-like API was added to\n+  :py:meth:`Dataset.resample` and :py:meth:`DataArray.resample`\n+  (:issue:`1272`). :ref:`Timeseries resampling <resampling>` is\n+  fully supported for data  with arbitrary dimensions as is both downsampling\n+  and upsampling (including linear, quadratic, cubic, and spline interpolation).\n+\n+  Old syntax:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [1]: ds.resample('24H', dim='time', how='max')\n+    Out[1]:\n+    <xarray.Dataset>\n+    [...]\n+\n+  New syntax:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [1]: ds.resample(time='24H').max()\n+    Out[1]:\n+    <xarray.Dataset>\n+    [...]\n+\n+  Note that both versions are currently supported, but using the old syntax will\n+  produce a warning encouraging users to adopt the new syntax.\n+  By `Daniel Rothenberg <https://github.com/darothen>`_.\n+\n+- Calling ``repr()`` or printing xarray objects at the command line or in a\n+  Jupyter Notebook will not longer automatically compute dask variables or\n+  load data on arrays lazily loaded from disk (:issue:`1522`).\n+  By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_.\n+\n+- Supplying ``coords`` as a dictionary to the ``DataArray`` constructor without\n+  also supplying an explicit ``dims`` argument is no longer supported. This\n+  behavior was deprecated in version 0.9 but will now raise an error\n+  (:issue:`727`).\n+\n+- Several existing features have been deprecated and will change to new\n+  behavior in xarray v0.11. If you use any of them with xarray v0.10, you\n+  should see a ``FutureWarning`` that describes how to update your code:\n+\n+  - ``Dataset.T`` has been deprecated an alias for ``Dataset.transpose()``\n+    (:issue:`1232`). In the next major version of xarray, it will provide short-\n+    cut lookup for variables or attributes with name ``'T'``.\n+  - ``DataArray.__contains__`` (e.g., ``key in data_array``) currently checks\n+    for membership in ``DataArray.coords``. In the next major version of\n+    xarray, it will check membership in the array data found in\n+    ``DataArray.values`` instead (:issue:`1267`).\n+  - Direct iteration over and counting a ``Dataset`` (e.g., ``[k for k in ds]``,\n+    ``ds.keys()``, ``ds.values()``, ``len(ds)`` and ``if ds``) currently\n+    includes all variables, both data and coordinates. For improved usability\n+    and consistency with pandas, in the next major version of xarray these will\n+    change to only include data variables (:issue:`884`).

You can identify such dimensions without coordinates\n+  by their appearance in list of \"Dimensions without coordinates\" in the\n+  ``Dataset`` or ``DataArray`` repr:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [1]: xr.Dataset({'foo': (('x', 'y'), [[1, 2]])})\n+    Out[1]:\n+    <xarray.Dataset>\n+    Dimensions:  (x: 1, y: 2)\n+    Dimensions without coordinates: x, y\n+    Data variables:\n+        foo      (x, y) int64 1 2\n+\n+  This has a number of implications:\n+\n+  - :py:func:`~align` and :py:meth:`~Dataset.reindex` can now error, if\n+    dimensions labels are missing and dimensions have different sizes.\n+  - Because pandas does not support missing indexes, methods such as\n+    ``to_dataframe``/``from_dataframe`` and ``stack``/``unstack`` no longer\n+    roundtrip faithfully on all inputs. Use :py:meth:`~Dataset.reset_index` to\n+    remove undesired indexes.\n+  - ``Dataset.__delitem__`` and :py:meth:`~Dataset.drop` no longer delete/drop\n+    variables that have dimensions matching a deleted/dropped variable.\n+  - ``DataArray.coords.__delitem__`` is now allowed on variables matching\n+    dimension names.\n+  - ``.sel`` and ``.loc`` now handle indexing along a dimension without\n+    coordinate labels by doing integer based indexing. See\n+    :ref:`indexing.missing_coordinates` for an example.\n+  - :py:attr:`~Dataset.indexes` is no longer guaranteed to include all\n+    dimensions names as keys. The new method :py:meth:`~Dataset.get_index` has\n+    been added to get an index for a dimension guaranteed, falling back to\n+    produce a default ``RangeIndex`` if necessary.\n+\n+- The default behavior of ``merge`` is now ``compat='no_conflicts'``, so some\n+  merges will now succeed in cases that previously raised\n+  ``xarray.MergeError``. Set ``compat='broadcast_equals'`` to restore the\n+  previous default. See :ref:`combining.no_conflicts` for more details.\n+\n+- Reading :py:attr:`~DataArray.values` no longer always caches values in a NumPy\n+  array :issue:`1128`. Caching of ``.values`` on variables read from netCDF\n+  files on disk is still the default when :py:func:`open_dataset` is called with\n+  ``cache=True``.\n+  By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_ and\n+  `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+- Pickling a ``Dataset`` or ``DataArray`` linked to a file on disk no longer\n+  caches its values into memory before pickling (:issue:`1128`). Instead, pickle\n+  stores file paths and restores objects by reopening file references. This\n+  enables preliminary, experimental use of xarray for opening files with\n+  `dask.distributed <https://distributed.readthedocs.io>`_.\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+- Coordinates used to index a dimension are now loaded eagerly into\n+  :py:class:`pandas.Index` objects, instead of loading the values lazily.\n+  By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_.\n+- Automatic levels for 2d plots are now guaranteed to land on ``vmin`` and\n+  ``vmax`` when these kwargs are explicitly provided (:issue:`1191`). The\n+  automated level selection logic also slightly changed.\n+  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+- ``DataArray.rename()`` behavior changed to strictly change the ``DataArray.name``\n+  if called with string argument, or strictly change coordinate names if called with\n+  dict-like argument.\n+  By `Markus Gonser <https://github.com/magonser>`_.\n+\n+- By default ``to_netcdf()`` add a ``_FillValue = NaN`` attributes to float types.\n+  By `Frederic Laliberte <https://github.com/laliberte>`_.\n+\n+- ``repr`` on ``DataArray`` objects uses an shortened display for NumPy array\n+  data that is less likely to overflow onto multiple pages (:issue:`1207`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- xarray no longer supports python 3.3, versions of dask prior to v0.9.0,\n+  or versions of bottleneck prior to v1.0.\n+\n+Deprecations\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Renamed the ``Coordinate`` class from xarray's low level API to\n+  :py:class:`~xarray.IndexVariable`. ``Variable.to_variable`` and\n+  ``Variable.to_coord`` have been renamed to\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.Variable.to_base_variable` and\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.Variable.to_index_variable`.\n+- Deprecated supplying ``coords`` as a dictionary to the ``DataArray``\n+  constructor without also supplying an explicit ``dims`` argument. The old\n+  behavior encouraged relying on the iteration order of dictionaries, which is\n+  a bad practice (:issue:`727`).\n+- Removed a number of methods deprecated since v0.7.0 or earlier:\n+  ``load_data``, ``vars``, ``drop_vars``, ``dump``, ``dumps`` and the\n+  ``variables`` keyword argument to ``Dataset``.\n+- Removed the dummy module that enabled ``import xray``.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Added new method :py:meth:`~DataArray.combine_first` to ``DataArray`` and\n+  ``Dataset``, based on the pandas method of the same name (see :ref:`combine`).\n+  By `Chun-Wei Yuan <https://github.com/chunweiyuan>`_.\n+\n+- Added the ability to change default automatic alignment (arithmetic_join=\"inner\")\n+  for binary operations via :py:func:`~xarray.set_options()`\n+  (see :ref:`math automatic alignment`).\n+  By `Chun-Wei Yuan <https://github.com/chunweiyuan>`_.\n+\n+- Add checking of ``attr`` names and values when saving to netCDF, raising useful\n+  error messages if they are invalid. (:issue:`911`).\n+  By `Robin Wilson <https://github.com/robintw>`_.\n+- Added ability to save ``DataArray`` objects directly to netCDF files using\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.to_netcdf`, and to load directly from netCDF files\n+  using :py:func:`~xarray.open_dataarray` (:issue:`915`). These remove the need\n+  to convert a ``DataArray`` to a ``Dataset`` before saving as a netCDF file,\n+  and deals with names to ensure a perfect 'roundtrip' capability.\n+  By `Robin Wilson <https://github.com/robintw>`_.\n+- Multi-index levels are now accessible as \"virtual\" coordinate variables,\n+  e.g., ``ds['time']`` can pull out the ``'time'`` level of a multi-index\n+  (see :ref:`coordinates`). ``sel`` also accepts providing multi-index levels\n+  as keyword arguments, e.g., ``ds.sel(time='2000-01')``\n+  (see :ref:`multi-level indexing`).\n+  By `Benoit Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.\n+- Added ``set_index``, ``reset_index`` and ``reorder_levels`` methods to\n+  easily create and manipulate (multi-)indexes (see :ref:`reshape.set_index`).\n+  By `Benoit Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.\n+- Added the ``compat`` option ``'no_conflicts'`` to ``merge``, allowing the\n+  combination of xarray objects with disjoint (:issue:`742`) or\n+  overlapping (:issue:`835`) coordinates as long as all present data agrees.\n+  By `Johnnie Gray <https://github.com/jcmgray>`_. See\n+  :ref:`combining.no_conflicts` for more details.\n+- It is now possible to set ``concat_dim=None`` explicitly in\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.open_mfdataset` to disable inferring a dimension along\n+  which to concatenate.\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+- Added methods :py:meth:`DataArray.compute`, :py:meth:`Dataset.compute`, and\n+  :py:meth:`Variable.compute` as a non-mutating alternative to\n+  :py:meth:`~DataArray.load`.\n+  By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_.\n+- Adds DataArray and Dataset methods :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.cumsum` and\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.cumprod`.  By `Phillip J. Wolfram\n+  <https://github.com/pwolfram>`_.\n+\n+- New properties :py:attr:`Dataset.sizes` and :py:attr:`DataArray.sizes` for\n+  providing consistent access to dimension length on both ``Dataset`` and\n+  ``DataArray`` (:issue:`921`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+- New keyword argument ``drop=True`` for :py:meth:`~DataArray.sel`,\n+  :py:meth:`~DataArray.isel` and :py:meth:`~DataArray.squeeze` for dropping\n+  scalar coordinates that arise from indexing.\n+  ``DataArray`` (:issue:`242`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- New top-level functions :py:func:`~xarray.full_like`,\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.zeros_like`, and :py:func:`~xarray.ones_like`\n+  By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_.\n+- Overriding a preexisting attribute with\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.register_dataset_accessor` or\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.register_dataarray_accessor` now issues a warning instead of\n+  raising an error (:issue:`1082`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+- Options for axes sharing between subplots are exposed to\n+  :py:class:`FacetGrid` and :py:func:`~xarray.plot.plot`, so axes\n+  sharing can be disabled for polar plots.\n+  By `Bas Hoonhout <https://github.com/hoonhout>`_.\n+- New utility functions :py:func:`~xarray.testing.assert_equal`,\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.testing.assert_identical`, and\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.testing.assert_allclose` for asserting relationships\n+  between xarray objects, designed for use in a pytest test suite.\n+- ``figsize``, ``size`` and ``aspect`` plot arguments are now supported for all\n+  plots (:issue:`897`). See :ref:`plotting.figsize` for more details.\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_ and\n+  `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+- New :py:meth:`~Dataset.info` method to summarize ``Dataset`` variables\n+  and attributes. The method prints to a buffer (e.g. ``stdout``) with output\n+  similar to what the command line utility ``ncdump -h`` produces (:issue:`1150`).\n+  By `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+- Added the ability write unlimited netCDF dimensions with the ``scipy`` and\n+  ``netcdf4`` backends via the new :py:attr:`~xray.Dataset.encoding` attribute\n+  or via the ``unlimited_dims`` argument to :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf`.\n+  By `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+- New :py:meth:`~DataArray.quantile` method to calculate quantiles from\n+  DataArray objects (:issue:`1187`).\n+  By `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+- ``groupby_bins`` now restores empty bins by default (:issue:`1019`).\n+  By `Ryan Abernathey <https://github.com/rabernat>`_.\n+\n+- Fix issues for dates outside the valid range of pandas timestamps\n+  (:issue:`975`). By `Mathias Hauser <https://github.com/mathause>`_.\n+\n+- Unstacking produced flipped array after stacking decreasing coordinate values\n+  (:issue:`980`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- Setting ``dtype`` via the ``encoding`` parameter of ``to_netcdf`` failed if\n+  the encoded dtype was the same as the dtype of the original array\n+  (:issue:`873`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- Fix issues with variables where both attributes ``_FillValue`` and\n+  ``missing_value`` are set to ``NaN`` (:issue:`997`).\n+  By `Marco Z\u00fchlke <https://github.com/mzuehlke>`_.\n+\n+- ``.where()`` and ``.fillna()`` now preserve attributes (:issue:`1009`).\n+  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+- Applying :py:func:`broadcast()` to an xarray object based on the dask backend\n+  won't accidentally convert the array from dask to numpy anymore (:issue:`978`).\n+  By `Guido Imperiale <https://github.com/crusaderky>`_.\n+\n+- ``Dataset.concat()`` now preserves variables order (:issue:`1027`).\n+  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+- Fixed an issue with pcolormesh (:issue:`781`). A new\n+  ``infer_intervals`` keyword gives control on whether the cell intervals\n+  should be computed or not.\n+  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+- Grouping over an dimension with non-unique values with ``groupby`` gives\n+  correct groups.\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- Fixed accessing coordinate variables with non-string names from ``.coords``.\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- :py:meth:`~xarray.DataArray.rename` now simultaneously renames the array and\n+  any coordinate with the same name, when supplied via a :py:class:`dict`\n+  (:issue:`1116`).\n+  By `Yves Delley <https://github.com/burnpanck>`_.\n+\n+- Fixed sub-optimal performance in certain operations with object arrays (:issue:`1121`).\n+  By `Yves Delley <https://github.com/burnpanck>`_.\n+\n+- Fix ``.groupby(group)`` when ``group`` has datetime dtype (:issue:`1132`).\n+  By `Jonas S\u00f8lvsteen <https://github.com/j08lue>`_.\n+\n+- Fixed a bug with facetgrid (the ``norm`` keyword was ignored, :issue:`1159`).\n+  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+- Resolved a concurrency bug that could cause Python to crash when\n+  simultaneously reading and writing netCDF4 files with dask (:issue:`1172`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- Fix to make ``.copy()`` actually copy dask arrays, which will be relevant for\n+  future releases of dask in which dask arrays will be mutable (:issue:`1180`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- Fix opening NetCDF files with multi-dimensional time variables\n+  (:issue:`1229`).\n+  By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+Performance improvements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.isel_points` and\n+  :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.sel_points` now use vectorised indexing in numpy\n+  and dask (:issue:`1161`), which can result in several orders of magnitude\n+  speedup.\n+  By `Jonathan Chambers <https://github.com/mangecoeur>`_.\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.8.2:\n+\n+v0.8.2 (18 August 2016)\n+-----------------------\n+\n+This release includes a number of bug fixes and minor enhancements.\n+\n+Breaking changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- :py:func:`~xarray.broadcast` and :py:func:`~xarray.concat` now auto-align\n+  inputs, using ``join=outer``.

Filled\n+  contour plots are unchanged.\n+- ``DataArray.values`` and ``.data`` now always returns an NumPy array-like\n+  object, even for 0-dimensional arrays with object dtype (:issue:`867`).\n+  Previously, ``.values`` returned native Python objects in such cases. To\n+  convert the values of scalar arrays to Python objects, use the ``.item()``\n+  method.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Groupby operations now support grouping over multidimensional variables. A new\n+  method called :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.groupby_bins` has also been added to\n+  allow users to specify bins for grouping. The new features are described in\n+  :ref:`groupby.multidim` and :ref:`examples.multidim`.\n+  By `Ryan Abernathey <https://github.com/rabernat>`_.\n+\n+- DataArray and Dataset method :py:meth:`where` now supports a ``drop=True``\n+  option that clips coordinate elements that are fully masked.  By\n+  `Phillip J. Wolfram <https://github.com/pwolfram>`_.\n+\n+- New top level :py:func:`merge` function allows for combining variables from\n+  any number of ``Dataset`` and/or ``DataArray`` variables. See :ref:`merge`\n+  for more details. By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- DataArray and Dataset method :py:meth:`resample` now supports the\n+  ``keep_attrs=False`` option that determines whether variable and dataset\n+  attributes are retained in the resampled object. By\n+  `Jeremy McGibbon <https://github.com/mcgibbon>`_.\n+\n+- Better multi-index support in DataArray and Dataset :py:meth:`sel` and\n+  :py:meth:`loc` methods, which now behave more closely to pandas and which\n+  also accept dictionaries for indexing based on given level names and labels\n+  (see :ref:`multi-level indexing`). By\n+  `Benoit Bovy <https://github.com/benbovy>`_.\n+\n+- New (experimental) decorators :py:func:`~xarray.register_dataset_accessor` and\n+  :py:func:`~xarray.register_dataarray_accessor` for registering custom xarray\n+  extensions without subclassing. They are described in the new documentation\n+  page on :ref:`internals`. By `Stephan Hoyer <https://github.com/shoyer>`_.\n+\n+- Round trip boolean datatypes. Previously, writing boolean datatypes to netCDF\n+  formats would raise an error since netCDF does not have a `bool` datatype.\n+  This feature reads/writes a `dtype` attribute to boolean variables in netCDF\n+  files. By `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+\n+- 2D plotting methods now have two new keywords (`cbar_ax` and `cbar_kwargs`),\n+  allowing more control on the colorbar (:issue:`872`).\n+  By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+- New Dataset method :py:meth:`filter_by_attrs`, akin to\n+  ``netCDF4.Dataset.get_variables_by_attributes``, to easily filter\n+  data variables using its attributes.\n+  `Filipe Fernandes <https://github.com/ocefpaf>`_.\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Attributes were being retained by default for some resampling\n+  operations when they should not. With the ``keep_attrs=False`` option, they\n+  will no longer be retained by default. This may be backwards-incompatible\n+  with some scripts, but the attributes may be kept by adding the\n+  ``keep_attrs=True`` option. By\n+  `Jeremy McGibbon <https://github.com/mcgibbon>`_.\n+\n+- Concatenating xarray objects along an axis with a MultiIndex or PeriodIndex\n+  preserves the nature of the index (:issue:`875`).

By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.7.2:\n+\n+v0.7.2 (13 March 2016)\n+----------------------\n+\n+This release includes two new, entirely backwards compatible features and\n+several bug fixes.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- New DataArray method :py:meth:`DataArray.dot` for calculating the dot\n+  product of two DataArrays along shared dimensions. By\n+  `Dean Pospisil <https://github.com/deanpospisil>`_.\n+\n+- Rolling window operations on DataArray objects are now supported via a new\n+  :py:meth:`DataArray.rolling` method. For example:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [1]: import xarray as xr; import numpy as np\n+\n+    In [2]: arr = xr.DataArray(np.arange(0, 7.5, 0.5).reshape(3, 5),\n+                               dims=('x', 'y'))\n+\n+    In [3]: arr\n+    Out[3]:\n+    <xarray.DataArray (x: 3, y: 5)>\n+    array([[ 0. ,  0.5,  1. ,  1.5,  2. ],\n+           [ 2.5,  3. ,  3.5,  4. ,  4.5],\n+           [ 5. ,  5.5,  6. ,  6.5,  7. ]])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * x        (x) int64 0 1 2\n+      * y        (y) int64 0 1 2 3 4\n+\n+    In [4]: arr.rolling(y=3, min_periods=2).mean()\n+    Out[4]:\n+    <xarray.DataArray (x: 3, y: 5)>\n+    array([[  nan,  0.25,  0.5 ,  1.  ,  1.5 ],\n+           [  nan,  2.75,  3.  ,  3.5 ,  4.  ],\n+           [  nan,  5.25,  5.5 ,  6.  ,  6.5 ]])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * x        (x) int64 0 1 2\n+      * y        (y) int64 0 1 2 3 4\n+\n+  See :ref:`comput.rolling` for more details. By\n+  `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Fixed an issue where plots using pcolormesh and Cartopy axes were being distorted\n+  by the inference of the axis interval breaks. This change chooses not to modify\n+  the coordinate variables when the axes have the attribute ``projection``, allowing\n+  Cartopy to handle the extent of pcolormesh plots (:issue:`781`). By\n+  `Joe Hamman <https://github.com/jhamman>`_.\n+\n+- 2D plots now better handle additional coordinates which are not ``DataArray``\n+  dimensions (:issue:`788`). By `Fabien Maussion <https://github.com/fmaussion>`_.\n+\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.7.1:\n+\n+v0.7.1 (16 February 2016)\n+-------------------------\n+\n+This is a bug fix release that includes two small, backwards compatible enhancements.\n+We recommend that all users upgrade.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Numerical operations now return empty objects on no overlapping labels rather\n+  than raising ``ValueError`` (:issue:`739`).\n+- :py:class:`~pd.Series` is now supported as valid input to the ``Dataset``\n+  constructor (:issue:`740`).\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Restore checks for shape consistency between data and coordinates in the\n+  DataArray constructor (:issue:`758`).\n+- Single dimension variables no longer transpose as part of a broader\n+  ``.transpose``. This  behavior was causing ``pandas.PeriodIndex`` dimensions\n+  to lose their type (:issue:`749`)\n+- :py:class:`~xarray.Dataset` labels remain as their native type on ``.to_dataset``.\n+  Previously they were coerced to strings (:issue:`745`)\n+- Fixed a bug where replacing a ``DataArray`` index coordinate would improperly\n+  align the coordinate (:issue:`725`).\n+- ``DataArray.reindex_like`` now maintains the dtype of complex numbers when\n+  reindexing leads to NaN values (:issue:`738`).\n+- ``Dataset.rename`` and ``DataArray.rename`` support the old and new names\n+  being the same (:issue:`724`).\n+- Fix :py:meth:`~xarray.Dataset.from_dataset` for DataFrames with Categorical\n+  column and a MultiIndex index (:issue:`737`).\n+- Fixes to ensure xarray works properly after the upcoming pandas v0.18 and\n+  NumPy v1.11 releases.\n+\n+Acknowledgments\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The following individuals contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Edward Richards\n+- Maximilian Roos\n+- Rafael Guedes\n+- Spencer Hill\n+- Stephan Hoyer\n+\n+.. _whats-new.0.7.0:\n+\n+v0.7.0 (21 January 2016)\n+------------------------\n+\n+This major release includes redesign of :py:class:`~xarray.DataArray`\n+internals, as well as new methods for reshaping, rolling and shifting\n+data. It includes preliminary support for :py:class:`pandas.MultiIndex`,\n+as well as a number of other features and bug fixes, several of which\n+offer improved compatibility with pandas.\n+\n+New name\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The project formerly known as \"xray\" is now \"xarray\", pronounced \"x-array\"!\n+This avoids a namespace conflict with the entire field of x-ray science. Renaming\n+our project seemed like the right thing to do, especially because some\n+scientists who work with actual x-rays are interested in using this project in\n+their work. Thanks for your understanding and patience in this transition. You\n+can now find our documentation and code repository at new URLs:\n+\n+- http://xarray.pydata.org\n+- http://github.com/pydata/xarray/\n+\n+To ease the transition, we have simultaneously released v0.7.0 of both\n+``xray`` and ``xarray`` on the Python Package Index. These packages are\n+identical. For now, ``import xray`` still works, except it issues a\n+deprecation warning. This will be the last xray release. Going forward, we\n+recommend switching your import statements to ``import xarray as xr``.\n+\n+.. _v0.7.0.breaking:\n+\n+Breaking changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- The internal data model used by :py:class:`~xray.DataArray` has been\n+  rewritten to fix several outstanding issues (:issue:`367`, :issue:`634`,\n+  `this stackoverflow report`_). Internally, ``DataArray`` is now implemented\n+  in terms of ``._variable`` and ``._coords`` attributes instead of holding\n+  variables in a ``Dataset`` object.\n+\n+  This refactor ensures that if a DataArray has the\n+  same name as one of its coordinates, the array and the coordinate no longer\n+  share the same data.\n+\n+  In practice, this means that creating a DataArray with the same ``name`` as\n+  one of its dimensions no longer automatically uses that array to label the\n+  corresponding coordinate. You will now need to provide coordinate labels\n+  explicitly. Here's the old behavior:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [2]: xray.DataArray([4, 5, 6], dims='x', name='x')\n+    Out[2]:\n+    <xray.DataArray 'x' (x: 3)>\n+    array([4, 5, 6])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * x        (x) int64 4 5 6\n+\n+  and the new behavior (compare the values of the ``x`` coordinate):\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [2]: xray.DataArray([4, 5, 6], dims='x', name='x')\n+    Out[2]:\n+    <xray.DataArray 'x' (x: 3)>\n+    array([4, 5, 6])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * x        (x) int64 0 1 2\n+\n+- It is no longer possible to convert a DataArray to a Dataset with\n+  :py:meth:`xray.DataArray.to_dataset` if it is unnamed. This will now\n+  raise ``ValueError``. If the array is unnamed, you need to supply the\n+  ``name`` argument.\n+\n+.. _this stackoverflow report: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33158558/python-xray-extract-first-and-last-time-value-within-each-month-of-a-timeseries\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Basic support for :py:class:`~pandas.MultiIndex` coordinates on xray objects, including\n+  indexing, :py:meth:`~DataArray.stack` and :py:meth:`~DataArray.unstack`:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [7]: df = pd.DataFrame({'foo': range(3),\n+       ...:                    'x': ['a', 'b', 'b'],\n+       ...:                    'y': [0, 0, 1]})\n+\n+    In [8]: s = df.set_index(['x', 'y'])['foo']\n+\n+    In [12]: arr = xray.DataArray(s, dims='z')\n+\n+    In [13]: arr\n+    Out[13]:\n+    <xray.DataArray 'foo' (z: 3)>\n+    array([0, 1, 2])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * z        (z) object ('a', 0) ('b', 0) ('b', 1)\n+\n+    In [19]: arr.indexes['z']\n+    Out[19]:\n+    MultiIndex(levels=[[u'a', u'b'], [0, 1]],\n+               labels=[[0, 1, 1], [0, 0, 1]],\n+               names=[u'x', u'y'])\n+\n+    In [14]: arr.unstack('z')\n+    Out[14]:\n+    <xray.DataArray 'foo' (x: 2, y: 2)>\n+    array([[  0.,  nan],\n+           [  1.,   2.]])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * x        (x) object 'a' 'b'\n+      * y        (y) int64 0 1\n+\n+    In [26]: arr.unstack('z').stack(z=('x', 'y'))\n+    Out[26]:\n+    <xray.DataArray 'foo' (z: 4)>\n+    array([  0.,  nan,   1.,   2.])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * z        (z) object ('a', 0) ('a', 1) ('b', 0) ('b', 1)\n+\n+  See :ref:`reshape.stack` for more details.\n+\n+  .. warning::\n+\n+      xray's MultiIndex support is still experimental, and we have a long to-\n+      do list of desired additions (:issue:`719`), including better display of\n+      multi-index levels when printing a ``Dataset``, and support for saving\n+      datasets with a MultiIndex to a netCDF file. User contributions in this\n+      area would be greatly appreciated.\n+\n+- Support for reading GRIB, HDF4 and other file formats via PyNIO_. See\n+  :ref:`io.pynio` for more details.\n+- Better error message when a variable is supplied with the same name as\n+  one of its dimensions.\n+- Plotting: more control on colormap parameters (:issue:`642`). ``vmin`` and\n+  ``vmax`` will not be silently ignored anymore. Setting ``center=False``\n+  prevents automatic selection of a divergent colormap.\n+- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.shift` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.roll` methods\n+  for shifting/rotating datasets or arrays along a dimension:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+     :okwarning:\n+\n+      array = xray.DataArray([5, 6, 7, 8], dims='x')\n+      array.shift(x=2)\n+      array.roll(x=2)\n+\n+  Notice that ``shift`` moves data independently of coordinates, but ``roll``\n+  moves both data and coordinates.\n+- Assigning a ``pandas`` object directly as a ``Dataset`` variable is now permitted. Its\n+  index names correspond to the ``dims`` of the ``Dataset``, and its data is aligned.\n+- Passing a :py:class:`pandas.DataFrame` or :py:class:`pandas.Panel` to a Dataset constructor\n+  is now permitted.\n+- New function :py:func:`~xray.broadcast` for explicitly broadcasting\n+  ``DataArray`` and ``Dataset`` objects against each other. For example:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      a = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], dims='x')\n+      b = xray.DataArray([5, 6], dims='y')\n+      a\n+      b\n+      a2, b2 = xray.broadcast(a, b)\n+      a2\n+      b2\n+\n+.. _PyNIO: https://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Nio.shtml\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Fixes for several issues found on ``DataArray`` objects with the same name\n+  as one of their coordinates (see :ref:`v0.7.0.breaking` for more details).\n+- ``DataArray.to_masked_array`` always returns masked array with mask being an\n+  array (not a scalar value) (:issue:`684`)\n+- Allows for (imperfect) repr of Coords when underlying index is PeriodIndex (:issue:`645`).\n+- Fixes for several issues found on ``DataArray`` objects with the same name\n+  as one of their coordinates (see :ref:`v0.7.0.breaking` for more details).\n+- Attempting to assign a ``Dataset`` or ``DataArray`` variable/attribute using\n+  attribute-style syntax (e.g., ``ds.foo = 42``) now raises an error rather\n+  than silently failing (:issue:`656`, :issue:`714`).\n+- You can now pass pandas objects with non-numpy dtypes (e.g., ``categorical``\n+  or ``datetime64`` with a timezone) into xray without an error\n+  (:issue:`716`).\n+\n+Acknowledgments\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The following individuals contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Antony Lee\n+- Fabien Maussion\n+- Joe Hamman\n+- Maximilian Roos\n+- Stephan Hoyer\n+- Takeshi Kanmae\n+- femtotrader\n+\n+v0.6.1 (21 October 2015)\n+------------------------\n+\n+This release contains a number of bug and compatibility fixes, as well\n+as enhancements to plotting, indexing and writing files to disk.\n+\n+Note that the minimum required version of dask for use with xray is now\n+version 0.6.\n+\n+API Changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- The handling of colormaps and discrete color lists for 2D plots in\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.plot` was changed to provide more compatibility\n+  with matplotlib's ``contour`` and ``contourf`` functions (:issue:`538`).\n+  Now discrete lists of colors should be specified using ``colors`` keyword,\n+  rather than ``cmap``.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Faceted plotting through :py:class:`~xray.plot.FacetGrid` and the\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.plot.plot` method. See :ref:`plotting.faceting` for more details\n+  and examples.\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex` now support\n+  the ``tolerance`` argument for controlling nearest-neighbor selection\n+  (:issue:`629`):\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [5]: array = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], dims='x')\n+\n+    In [6]: array.reindex(x=[0.9, 1.5], method='nearest', tolerance=0.2)\n+    Out[6]:\n+    <xray.DataArray (x: 2)>\n+    array([  2.,  nan])\n+    Coordinates:\n+      * x        (x) float64 0.9 1.5\n+\n+  This feature requires pandas v0.17 or newer.\n+- New ``encoding`` argument in :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` for writing\n+  netCDF files with compression, as described in the new documentation\n+  section on :ref:`io.netcdf.writing_encoded`.\n+- Add :py:attr:`~xray.Dataset.real` and :py:attr:`~xray.Dataset.imag`\n+  attributes to Dataset and DataArray (:issue:`553`).\n+- More informative error message with :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.from_dataframe`\n+  if the frame has duplicate columns.\n+- xray now uses deterministic names for dask arrays it creates or opens from\n+  disk. This allows xray users to take advantage of dask's nascent support for\n+  caching intermediate computation results. See :issue:`555` for an example.\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Forwards compatibility with the latest pandas release (v0.17.0). We were\n+  using some internal pandas routines for datetime conversion, which\n+  unfortunately have now changed upstream (:issue:`569`).\n+- Aggregation functions now correctly skip ``NaN`` for data for ``complex128``\n+  dtype (:issue:`554`).\n+- Fixed indexing 0d arrays with unicode dtype (:issue:`568`).\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.name` and Dataset keys must be a string or None to\n+  be written to netCDF (:issue:`533`).\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.where` now uses dask instead of numpy if either the\n+  array or ``other`` is a dask array. Previously, if ``other`` was a numpy array\n+  the method was evaluated eagerly.\n+- Global attributes are now handled more consistently when loading remote\n+  datasets using ``engine='pydap'`` (:issue:`574`).\n+- It is now possible to assign to the ``.data`` attribute of DataArray objects.\n+- ``coordinates`` attribute is now kept in the encoding dictionary after\n+  decoding (:issue:`610`).\n+- Compatibility with numpy 1.10 (:issue:`617`).\n+\n+Acknowledgments\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The following individuals contributed to this release:\n+\n+- Ryan Abernathey\n+- Pete Cable\n+- Clark Fitzgerald\n+- Joe Hamman\n+- Stephan Hoyer\n+- Scott Sinclair\n+\n+v0.6.0 (21 August 2015)\n+-----------------------\n+\n+This release includes numerous bug fixes and enhancements. Highlights\n+include the introduction of a plotting module and the new Dataset and DataArray\n+methods :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.isel_points`, :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel_points`,\n+:py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.where` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.diff`. There are no\n+breaking changes from v0.5.2.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Plotting methods have been implemented on DataArray objects\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.plot` through integration with matplotlib\n+  (:issue:`185`). For an introduction, see :ref:`plotting`.\n+- Variables in netCDF files with multiple missing values are now decoded as NaN\n+  after issuing a warning if open_dataset is called with mask_and_scale=True.\n+- We clarified our rules for when the result from an xray operation is a copy\n+  vs. a view (see :ref:`copies vs views` for more details).\n+- Dataset variables are now written to netCDF files in order of appearance\n+  when using the netcdf4 backend (:issue:`479`).\n+\n+- Added :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.isel_points` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel_points`\n+  to support pointwise indexing of Datasets and DataArrays (:issue:`475`).\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [1]: da = xray.DataArray(np.arange(56).reshape((7, 8)),\n+       ...:                     coords={'x': list('abcdefg'),\n+       ...:                             'y': 10 * np.arange(8)},\n+       ...:                     dims=['x', 'y'])\n+\n+    In [2]: da\n+    Out[2]:\n+    <xray.DataArray (x: 7, y: 8)>\n+    array([[ 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7],\n+           [ 8,  9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15],\n+           [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23],\n+           [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31],\n+           [32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39],\n+           [40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47],\n+           [48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55]])\n+    Coordinates:\n+    * y        (y) int64 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70\n+    * x        (x) |S1 'a' 'b' 'c' 'd' 'e' 'f' 'g'\n+\n+    # we can index by position along each dimension\n+    In [3]: da.isel_points(x=[0, 1, 6], y=[0, 1, 0], dim='points')\n+    Out[3]:\n+    <xray.DataArray (points: 3)>\n+    array([ 0,  9, 48])\n+    Coordinates:\n+        y        (points) int64 0 10 0\n+        x        (points) |S1 'a' 'b' 'g'\n+      * points   (points) int64 0 1 2\n+\n+    # or equivalently by label\n+    In [9]: da.sel_points(x=['a', 'b', 'g'], y=[0, 10, 0], dim='points')\n+    Out[9]:\n+    <xray.DataArray (points: 3)>\n+    array([ 0,  9, 48])\n+    Coordinates:\n+        y        (points) int64 0 10 0\n+        x        (points) |S1 'a' 'b' 'g'\n+      * points   (points) int64 0 1 2\n+\n+- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.where` method for masking xray objects according\n+  to some criteria. This works particularly well with multi-dimensional data:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+    ds = xray.Dataset(coords={'x': range(100), 'y': range(100)})\n+    ds['distance'] = np.sqrt(ds.x ** 2 + ds.y ** 2)\n+\n+    @savefig where_example.png width=4in height=4in\n+    ds.distance.where(ds.distance < 100).plot()\n+\n+- Added new methods :py:meth:`DataArray.diff <xray.DataArray.diff>`\n+  and :py:meth:`Dataset.diff <xray.Dataset.diff>` for finite\n+  difference calculations along a given axis.\n+\n+- New :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.to_masked_array` convenience method for\n+  returning a numpy.ma.MaskedArray.\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+    da = xray.DataArray(np.random.random_sample(size=(5, 4)))\n+    da.where(da < 0.5)\n+    da.where(da < 0.5).to_masked_array(copy=True)\n+\n+- Added new flag \"drop_variables\" to :py:meth:`~xray.open_dataset` for\n+  excluding variables from being parsed. This may be useful to drop\n+  variables with problems or inconsistent values.\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Fixed aggregation functions (e.g., sum and mean) on big-endian arrays when\n+  bottleneck is installed (:issue:`489`).\n+- Dataset aggregation functions dropped variables with unsigned integer dtype\n+  (:issue:`505`).\n+- ``.any()`` and ``.all()`` were not lazy when used on xray objects containing\n+  dask arrays.\n+- Fixed an error when attempting to saving datetime64 variables to netCDF\n+  files when the first element is ``NaT`` (:issue:`528`).\n+- Fix pickle on DataArray objects (:issue:`515`).\n+- Fixed unnecessary coercion of float64 to float32 when using netcdf3 and\n+  netcdf4_classic formats (:issue:`526`).\n+\n+v0.5.2 (16 July 2015)\n+---------------------\n+\n+This release contains bug fixes, several additional options for opening and\n+saving netCDF files, and a backwards incompatible rewrite of the advanced\n+options for ``xray.concat``.\n+\n+Backwards incompatible changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- The optional arguments ``concat_over`` and ``mode`` in :py:func:`~xray.concat` have\n+  been removed and replaced by ``data_vars`` and ``coords``. The new arguments are both\n+  more easily understood and more robustly implemented, and allowed us to fix a bug\n+  where ``concat`` accidentally loaded data into memory. If you set values for\n+  these optional arguments manually, you will need to update your code. The default\n+  behavior should be unchanged.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- :py:func:`~xray.open_mfdataset` now supports a ``preprocess`` argument for\n+  preprocessing datasets prior to concatenaton. This is useful if datasets\n+  cannot be otherwise merged automatically, e.g., if the original datasets\n+  have conflicting index coordinates (:issue:`443`).\n+- :py:func:`~xray.open_dataset` and :py:func:`~xray.open_mfdataset` now use a\n+  global thread lock by default for reading from netCDF files with dask. This\n+  avoids possible segmentation faults for reading from netCDF4 files when HDF5\n+  is not configured properly for concurrent access (:issue:`444`).\n+- Added support for serializing arrays of complex numbers with `engine='h5netcdf'`.\n+- The new :py:func:`~xray.save_mfdataset` function allows for saving multiple\n+  datasets to disk simultaneously. This is useful when processing large datasets\n+  with dask.array. For example, to save a dataset too big to fit into memory\n+  to one file per year, we could write:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [1]: years, datasets = zip(*ds.groupby('time.year'))\n+\n+    In [2]: paths = ['%s.nc' % y for y in years]\n+\n+    In [3]: xray.save_mfdataset(datasets, paths)\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Fixed ``min``, ``max``, ``argmin`` and ``argmax`` for arrays with string or\n+  unicode types (:issue:`453`).\n+- :py:func:`~xray.open_dataset` and :py:func:`~xray.open_mfdataset` support\n+  supplying chunks as a single integer.\n+- Fixed a bug in serializing scalar datetime variable to netCDF.\n+- Fixed a bug that could occur in serialization of 0-dimensional integer arrays.\n+- Fixed a bug where concatenating DataArrays was not always lazy (:issue:`464`).\n+- When reading datasets with h5netcdf, bytes attributes are decoded to strings.\n+  This allows conventions decoding to work properly on Python 3 (:issue:`451`).\n+\n+v0.5.1 (15 June 2015)\n+---------------------\n+\n+This minor release fixes a few bugs and an inconsistency with pandas. It also\n+adds the ``pipe`` method, copied from pandas.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Added :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.pipe`, replicating the `new pandas method`_ in version\n+  0.16.2. See :ref:`transforming datasets` for more details.\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.assign` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.assign_coords`\n+  now assign new variables in sorted (alphabetical) order, mirroring the\n+  behavior in pandas. Previously, the order was arbitrary.\n+\n+.. _new pandas method: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.16.2/whatsnew.html#pipe\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- ``xray.concat`` fails in an edge case involving identical coordinate variables (:issue:`425`)\n+- We now decode variables loaded from netCDF3 files with the scipy engine using native\n+  endianness (:issue:`416`). This resolves an issue when aggregating these arrays with\n+  bottleneck installed.\n+\n+v0.5 (1 June 2015)\n+------------------\n+\n+Highlights\n+~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The headline feature in this release is experimental support for out-of-core\n+computing (data that doesn't fit into memory) with dask_. This includes a new\n+top-level function :py:func:`~xray.open_mfdataset` that makes it easy to open\n+a collection of netCDF (using dask) as a single ``xray.Dataset`` object. For\n+more on dask, read the `blog post introducing xray + dask`_ and the new\n+documentation section :doc:`dask`.\n+\n+.. _blog post introducing xray + dask: https://www.anaconda.com/blog/developer-blog/xray-dask-out-core-labeled-arrays-python/\n+\n+Dask makes it possible to harness parallelism and manipulate gigantic datasets\n+with xray. It is currently an optional dependency, but it may become required\n+in the future.\n+\n+Backwards incompatible changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- The logic used for choosing which variables are concatenated with\n+  :py:func:`~xray.concat` has changed. Previously, by default any variables\n+  which were equal across a dimension were not concatenated. This lead to some\n+  surprising behavior, where the behavior of groupby and concat operations\n+  could depend on runtime values (:issue:`268`). For example:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+    :verbatim:\n+\n+    In [1]: ds = xray.Dataset({'x': 0})\n+\n+    In [2]: xray.concat([ds, ds], dim='y')\n+    Out[2]:\n+    <xray.Dataset>\n+    Dimensions:  ()\n+    Coordinates:\n+        *empty*\n+    Data variables:\n+        x        int64 0\n+\n+  Now, the default always concatenates data variables:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+    :suppress:\n+\n+    ds = xray.Dataset({'x': 0})\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+    xray.concat([ds, ds], dim='y')\n+\n+  To obtain the old behavior, supply the argument ``concat_over=[]``.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_array` and enhanced\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.to_dataset` methods make it easy to switch back\n+  and forth between arrays and datasets:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      ds = xray.Dataset({'a': 1, 'b': ('x', [1, 2, 3])},\n+                        coords={'c': 42}, attrs={'Conventions': 'None'})\n+      ds.to_array()\n+      ds.to_array().to_dataset(dim='variable')\n+\n+- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.fillna` method to fill missing values, modeled\n+  off the pandas method of the same name:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      array = xray.DataArray([np.nan, 1, np.nan, 3], dims='x')\n+      array.fillna(0)\n+\n+  ``fillna`` works on both ``Dataset`` and ``DataArray`` objects, and uses\n+  index based alignment and broadcasting like standard binary operations. It\n+  also can be applied by group, as illustrated in\n+  :ref:`fill with climatology`.\n+- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.assign` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.assign_coords`\n+  methods patterned off the new :py:meth:`DataFrame.assign <pandas.DataFrame.assign>`\n+  method in pandas:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      ds = xray.Dataset({'y': ('x', [1, 2, 3])})\n+      ds.assign(z = lambda ds: ds.y ** 2)\n+      ds.assign_coords(z = ('x', ['a', 'b', 'c']))\n+\n+  These methods return a new Dataset (or DataArray) with updated data or\n+  coordinate variables.\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.sel` now supports the ``method`` parameter, which works\n+  like the paramter of the same name on :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex`. It\n+  provides a simple interface for doing nearest-neighbor interpolation:\n+\n+  .. use verbatim because I can't seem to install pandas 0.16.1 on RTD :(\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+      :verbatim:\n+\n+      In [12]: ds.sel(x=1.1, method='nearest')\n+      Out[12]:\n+      <xray.Dataset>\n+      Dimensions:  ()\n+      Coordinates:\n+          x        int64 1\n+      Data variables:\n+          y        int64 2\n+\n+      In [13]: ds.sel(x=[1.1, 2.1], method='pad')\n+      Out[13]:\n+      <xray.Dataset>\n+      Dimensions:  (x: 2)\n+      Coordinates:\n+        * x        (x) int64 1 2\n+      Data variables:\n+          y        (x) int64 2 3\n+\n+  See :ref:`nearest neighbor lookups` for more details.\n+- You can now control the underlying backend used for accessing remote\n+  datasets (via OPeNDAP) by specifying ``engine='netcdf4'`` or\n+  ``engine='pydap'``.\n+- xray now provides experimental support for reading and writing netCDF4 files directly\n+  via `h5py`_ with the `h5netcdf`_ package, avoiding the netCDF4-Python package. You\n+  will need to install h5netcdf and specify ``engine='h5netcdf'`` to try this\n+  feature.\n+- Accessing data from remote datasets now has retrying logic (with exponential\n+  backoff) that should make it robust to occasional bad responses from DAP\n+  servers.\n+- You can control the width of the Dataset repr with :py:class:`xray.set_options`.\n+  It can be used either as a context manager, in which case the default is restored\n+  outside the context:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      ds = xray.Dataset({'x': np.arange(1000)})\n+      with xray.set_options(display_width=40):\n+          print(ds)\n+\n+  Or to set a global option:\n+\n+  .. ipython::\n+      :verbatim:\n+\n+      In [1]: xray.set_options(display_width=80)\n+\n+  The default value for the ``display_width`` option is 80.\n+\n+.. _h5py: http://www.h5py.org/\n+.. _h5netcdf: https://github.com/shoyer/h5netcdf\n+\n+Deprecations\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- The method ``load_data()`` has been renamed to the more succinct\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.load`.\n+\n+v0.4.1 (18 March 2015)\n+----------------------\n+\n+The release contains bug fixes and several new features. All changes should be\n+fully backwards compatible.\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- New documentation sections on :ref:`time-series` and\n+  :ref:`combining multiple files`.\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.resample` lets you resample a dataset or data array to\n+  a new temporal resolution. The syntax is the `same as pandas`_, except you\n+  need to supply the time dimension explicitly:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+     :verbatim:\n+\n+      time = pd.date_range('2000-01-01', freq='6H', periods=10)\n+      array = xray.DataArray(np.arange(10), [('time', time)])\n+      array.resample('1D', dim='time')\n+\n+  You can specify how to do the resampling with the ``how`` argument and other\n+  options such as ``closed`` and ``label`` let you control labeling:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+     :verbatim:\n+\n+      array.resample('1D', dim='time', how='sum', label='right')\n+\n+  If the desired temporal resolution is higher than the original data\n+  (upsampling), xray will insert missing values:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+     :verbatim:\n+\n+      array.resample('3H', 'time')\n+\n+- ``first`` and ``last`` methods on groupby objects let you take the first or\n+  last examples from each group along the grouped axis:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+     :verbatim:\n+\n+      array.groupby('time.day').first()\n+\n+  These methods combine well with ``resample``:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+     :verbatim:\n+\n+      array.resample('1D', dim='time', how='first')\n+\n+\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.swap_dims` allows for easily swapping one dimension\n+  out for another:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+       ds = xray.Dataset({'x': range(3), 'y': ('x', list('abc'))})\n+       ds\n+       ds.swap_dims({'x': 'y'})\n+\n+  This was possible in earlier versions of xray, but required some contortions.\n+- :py:func:`~xray.open_dataset` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` now\n+  accept an ``engine`` argument to explicitly select which underlying library\n+  (netcdf4 or scipy) is used for reading/writing a netCDF file.\n+\n+.. _same as pandas: http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/timeseries.html#up-and-downsampling\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Fixed a bug where data netCDF variables read from disk with\n+  ``engine='scipy'`` could still be associated with the file on disk, even\n+  after closing the file (:issue:`341`). This manifested itself in warnings\n+  about mmapped arrays and segmentation faults (if the data was accessed).\n+- Silenced spurious warnings about all-NaN slices when using nan-aware\n+  aggregation methods (:issue:`344`).\n+- Dataset aggregations with ``keep_attrs=True`` now preserve attributes on\n+  data variables, not just the dataset itself.\n+- Tests for xray now pass when run on Windows (:issue:`360`).\n+- Fixed a regression in v0.4 where saving to netCDF could fail with the error\n+  ``ValueError: could not automatically determine time units``.\n+\n+v0.4 (2 March, 2015)\n+--------------------\n+\n+This is one of the biggest releases yet for xray: it includes some major\n+changes that may break existing code, along with the usual collection of minor\n+enhancements and bug fixes. On the plus side, this release includes all\n+hitherto planned breaking changes, so the upgrade path for xray should be\n+smoother going forward.\n+\n+Breaking changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- We now automatically align index labels in arithmetic, dataset construction,\n+  merging and updating. This means the need for manually invoking methods like\n+  :py:func:`~xray.align` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex_like` should be\n+  vastly reduced.\n+\n+  :ref:`For arithmetic<math automatic alignment>`, we align\n+  based on the **intersection** of labels:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      lhs = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], [('x', [0, 1, 2])])\n+      rhs = xray.DataArray([2, 3, 4], [('x', [1, 2, 3])])\n+      lhs + rhs\n+\n+  :ref:`For dataset construction and merging<merge>`, we align based on the\n+  **union** of labels:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      xray.Dataset({'foo': lhs, 'bar': rhs})\n+\n+  :ref:`For update and __setitem__<update>`, we align based on the **original**\n+  object:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      lhs.coords['rhs'] = rhs\n+      lhs\n+\n+- Aggregations like ``mean`` or ``median`` now skip missing values by default:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      xray.DataArray([1, 2, np.nan, 3]).mean()\n+\n+  You can turn this behavior off by supplying the keyword arugment\n+  ``skipna=False``.\n+\n+  These operations are lightning fast thanks to integration with bottleneck_,\n+  which is a new optional dependency for xray (numpy is used if bottleneck is\n+  not installed).\n+- Scalar coordinates no longer conflict with constant arrays with the same\n+  value (e.g., in arithmetic, merging datasets and concat), even if they have\n+  different shape (:issue:`243`). For example, the coordinate ``c`` here\n+  persists through arithmetic, even though it has different shapes on each\n+  DataArray:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      a = xray.DataArray([1, 2], coords={'c': 0}, dims='x')\n+      b = xray.DataArray([1, 2], coords={'c': ('x', [0, 0])}, dims='x')\n+      (a + b).coords\n+\n+  This functionality can be controlled through the ``compat`` option, which\n+  has also been added to the :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` constructor.\n+- Datetime shortcuts such as ``'time.month'`` now return a ``DataArray`` with\n+  the name ``'month'``, not ``'time.month'`` (:issue:`345`). This makes it\n+  easier to index the resulting arrays when they are used with ``groupby``:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      time = xray.DataArray(pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=365),\n+                            dims='time', name='time')\n+      counts = time.groupby('time.month').count()\n+      counts.sel(month=2)\n+\n+  Previously, you would need to use something like\n+  ``counts.sel(**{'time.month': 2}})``, which is much more awkward.\n+- The ``season`` datetime shortcut now returns an array of string labels\n+  such `'DJF'`:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      ds = xray.Dataset({'t': pd.date_range('2000-01-01', periods=12, freq='M')})\n+      ds['t.season']\n+\n+  Previously, it returned numbered seasons 1 through 4.\n+- We have updated our use of the terms of \"coordinates\" and \"variables\". What\n+  were known in previous versions of xray as \"coordinates\" and \"variables\" are\n+  now referred to throughout the documentation as \"coordinate variables\" and\n+  \"data variables\". This brings xray in closer alignment to `CF Conventions`_.\n+  The only visible change besides the documentation is that ``Dataset.vars``\n+  has been renamed ``Dataset.data_vars``.\n+- You will need to update your code if you have been ignoring deprecation\n+  warnings: methods and attributes that were deprecated in xray v0.3 or earlier\n+  (e.g., ``dimensions``, ``attributes```) have gone away.\n+\n+.. _bottleneck: https://github.com/kwgoodman/bottleneck\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Support for :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.reindex` with a fill method. This\n+  provides a useful shortcut for upsampling:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      data = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], [('x', range(3))])\n+      data.reindex(x=[0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5], method='pad')\n+\n+  This will be especially useful once pandas 0.16 is released, at which point\n+  xray will immediately support reindexing with\n+  `method='nearest' <https://github.com/pydata/pandas/pull/9258>`_.\n+- Use functions that return generic ndarrays with DataArray.groupby.apply and\n+  Dataset.apply (:issue:`327` and :issue:`329`). Thanks Jeff Gerard!\n+- Consolidated the functionality of ``dumps`` (writing a dataset to a netCDF3\n+  bytestring) into :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` (:issue:`333`).\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` now supports writing to groups in netCDF4\n+  files (:issue:`333`). It also finally has a full docstring -- you should read\n+  it!\n+- :py:func:`~xray.open_dataset` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf` now\n+  work on netCDF3 files when netcdf4-python is not installed as long as scipy\n+  is available (:issue:`333`).\n+- The new :py:meth:`Dataset.drop <xray.Dataset.drop>` and\n+  :py:meth:`DataArray.drop <xray.DataArray.drop>` methods makes it easy to drop\n+  explicitly listed variables or index labels:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      # drop variables\n+      ds = xray.Dataset({'x': 0, 'y': 1})\n+      ds.drop('x')\n+\n+      # drop index labels\n+      arr = xray.DataArray([1, 2, 3], coords=[('x', list('abc'))])\n+      arr.drop(['a', 'c'], dim='x')\n+\n+- :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.broadcast_equals` has been added to correspond to\n+  the new ``compat`` option.\n+- Long attributes are now truncated at 500 characters when printing a dataset\n+  (:issue:`338`). This should make things more convenient for working with\n+  datasets interactively.\n+- Added a new documentation example, :ref:`monthly means example`. Thanks Joe\n+  Hamman!\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Several bug fixes related to decoding time units from netCDF files\n+  (:issue:`316`, :issue:`330`). Thanks Stefan Pfenninger!\n+- xray no longer requires ``decode_coords=False`` when reading datasets with\n+  unparseable coordinate attributes (:issue:`308`).\n+- Fixed ``DataArray.loc`` indexing with ``...`` (:issue:`318`).\n+- Fixed an edge case that resulting in an error when reindexing\n+  multi-dimensional variables (:issue:`315`).\n+- Slicing with negative step sizes (:issue:`312`).\n+- Invalid conversion of string arrays to numeric dtype (:issue:`305`).\n+- Fixed``repr()`` on dataset objects with non-standard dates (:issue:`347`).\n+\n+Deprecations\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- ``dump`` and ``dumps`` have been deprecated in favor of\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.to_netcdf`.\n+- ``drop_vars`` has been deprecated in favor of :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.drop`.\n+\n+Future plans\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+The biggest feature I'm excited about working toward in the immediate future\n+is supporting out-of-core operations in xray using Dask_, a part of the Blaze_\n+project. For a preview of using Dask with weather data, read\n+`this blog post`_ by Matthew Rocklin. See :issue:`328` for more details.\n+\n+.. _Dask: http://dask.pydata.org\n+.. _Blaze: http://blaze.pydata.org\n+.. _this blog post: http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2015/02/13/Towards-OOC-Slicing-and-Stacking/\n+\n+v0.3.2 (23 December, 2014)\n+--------------------------\n+\n+This release focused on bug-fixes, speedups and resolving some niggling\n+inconsistencies.\n+\n+There are a few cases where the behavior of xray differs from the previous\n+version. However, I expect that in almost all cases your code will continue to\n+run unmodified.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    xray now requires pandas v0.15.0 or later. This was necessary for\n+    supporting TimedeltaIndex without too many painful hacks.\n+\n+Backwards incompatible changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Arrays of :py:class:`datetime.datetime` objects are now automatically cast to\n+  ``datetime64[ns]`` arrays when stored in an xray object, using machinery\n+  borrowed from pandas:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      from datetime import datetime\n+      xray.Dataset({'t': [datetime(2000, 1, 1)]})\n+\n+- xray now has support (including serialization to netCDF) for\n+  :py:class:`~pandas.TimedeltaIndex`. :py:class:`datetime.timedelta` objects\n+  are thus accordingly cast to ``timedelta64[ns]`` objects when appropriate.\n+- Masked arrays are now properly coerced to use ``NaN`` as a sentinel value\n+  (:issue:`259`).\n+\n+Enhancements\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Due to popular demand, we have added experimental attribute style access as\n+  a shortcut for dataset variables, coordinates and attributes:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+     ds = xray.Dataset({'tmin': ([], 25, {'units': 'celcius'})})\n+     ds.tmin.units\n+\n+  Tab-completion for these variables should work in editors such as IPython.\n+  However, setting variables or attributes in this fashion is not yet\n+  supported because there are some unresolved ambiguities (:issue:`300`).\n+- You can now use a dictionary for indexing with labeled dimensions. This\n+  provides a safe way to do assignment with labeled dimensions:\n+\n+  .. ipython:: python\n+\n+      array = xray.DataArray(np.zeros(5), dims=['x'])\n+      array[dict(x=slice(3))] = 1\n+      array\n+\n+- Non-index coordinates can now be faithfully written to and restored from\n+  netCDF files. This is done according to CF conventions when possible by\n+  using the ``coordinates`` attribute on a data variable. When not possible,\n+  xray defines a global ``coordinates`` attribute.\n+- Preliminary support for converting ``xray.DataArray`` objects to and from\n+  CDAT_ ``cdms2`` variables.\n+- We sped up any operation that involves creating a new Dataset or DataArray\n+  (e.g., indexing, aggregation, arithmetic) by a factor of 30 to 50%. The full\n+  speed up requires cyordereddict_ to be installed.\n+\n+.. _CDAT: http://uvcdat.llnl.gov/\n+.. _cyordereddict: https://github.com/shoyer/cyordereddict\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Fix for ``to_dataframe()`` with 0d string/object coordinates (:issue:`287`)\n+- Fix for ``to_netcdf`` with 0d string variable (:issue:`284`)\n+- Fix writing datetime64 arrays to netcdf if NaT is present (:issue:`270`)\n+- Fix align silently upcasts data arrays when NaNs are inserted (:issue:`264`)\n+\n+Future plans\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- I am contemplating switching to the terms \"coordinate variables\" and \"data\n+  variables\" instead of the (currently used) \"coordinates\" and \"variables\",\n+  following their use in `CF Conventions`_ (:issue:`293`). This would mostly\n+  have implications for the documentation, but I would also change the\n+  ``Dataset`` attribute ``vars`` to ``data``.\n+- I no longer certain that automatic label alignment for arithmetic would be a\n+  good idea for xray -- it is a feature from pandas that I have not missed\n+  (:issue:`186`).\n+- The main API breakage that I *do* anticipate in the next release is finally\n+  making all aggregation operations skip missing values by default\n+  (:issue:`130`). I'm pretty sick of writing ``ds.reduce(np.nanmean, 'time')``.\n+- The next version of xray (0.4) will remove deprecated features and aliases\n+  whose use currently raises a warning.\n+\n+If you have opinions about any of these anticipated changes, I would love to\n+hear them -- please add a note to any of the referenced GitHub issues.\n+\n+.. _CF Conventions: http://cfconventions.org/Data/cf-conventions/cf-conventions-1.6/build/cf-conventions.html\n+\n+v0.3.1 (22 October, 2014)\n+-------------------------\n+\n+This is mostly a bug-fix release to make xray compatible with the latest\n+release of pandas (v0.15).\n+\n+We added several features to better support working with missing values and\n+exporting xray objects to pandas. We also reorganized the internal API for\n+serializing and deserializing datasets, but this change should be almost\n+entirely transparent to users.\n+\n+Other than breaking the experimental DataStore API, there should be no\n+backwards incompatible changes.\n+\n+New features\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Added :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.count` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.dropna`\n+  methods, copied from pandas, for working with missing values (:issue:`247`,\n+  :issue:`58`).\n+- Added :py:meth:`DataArray.to_pandas <xray.DataArray.to_pandas>` for\n+  converting a data array into the pandas object with the same dimensionality\n+  (1D to Series, 2D to DataFrame, etc.) (:issue:`255`).\n+- Support for reading gzipped netCDF3 files (:issue:`239`).\n+- Reduced memory usage when writing netCDF files (:issue:`251`).\n+- 'missing_value' is now supported as an alias for the '_FillValue' attribute\n+  on netCDF variables (:issue:`245`).\n+- Trivial indexes, equivalent to ``range(n)`` where ``n`` is the length of the\n+  dimension, are no longer written to disk (:issue:`245`).\n+\n+Bug fixes\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- Compatibility fixes for pandas v0.15 (:issue:`262`).\n+- Fixes for display and indexing of ``NaT`` (not-a-time) (:issue:`238`,\n+  :issue:`240`)\n+- Fix slicing by label was an argument is a data array (:issue:`250`).\n+- Test data is now shipped with the source distribution (:issue:`253`).\n+- Ensure order does not matter when doing arithmetic with scalar data arrays\n+  (:issue:`254`).\n+- Order of dimensions preserved with ``DataArray.to_dataframe`` (:issue:`260`).\n+\n+v0.3 (21 September 2014)\n+------------------------\n+\n+New features\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- **Revamped coordinates**: \"coordinates\" now refer to all arrays that are not\n+  used to index a dimension. Coordinates are intended to allow for keeping track\n+  of arrays of metadata that describe the grid on which the points in \"variable\"\n+  arrays lie. They are preserved (when unambiguous) even though mathematical\n+  operations.\n+- **Dataset math** :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects now support all arithmetic\n+  operations directly. Dataset-array operations map across all dataset\n+  variables; dataset-dataset operations act on each pair of variables with the\n+  same name.\n+- **GroupBy math**: This provides a convenient shortcut for normalizing by the\n+  average value of a group.\n+- The dataset ``__repr__`` method has been entirely overhauled; dataset\n+  objects now show their values when printed.\n+- You can now index a dataset with a list of variables to return a new dataset:\n+  ``ds[['foo', 'bar']]``.\n+\n+Backwards incompatible changes\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- ``Dataset.__eq__`` and ``Dataset.__ne__`` are now element-wise operations\n+  instead of comparing all values to obtain a single boolean. Use the method\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.equals` instead.\n+\n+Deprecations\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+- ``Dataset.noncoords`` is deprecated: use ``Dataset.vars`` instead.\n+- ``Dataset.select_vars`` deprecated: index a ``Dataset`` with a list of\n+  variable names instead.\n+- ``DataArray.select_vars`` and ``DataArray.drop_vars`` deprecated: use\n+  :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.reset_coords` instead.\n+\n+v0.2 (14 August 2014)\n+---------------------\n+\n+This is major release that includes some new features and quite a few bug\n+fixes. Here are the highlights:\n+\n+- There is now a direct constructor for ``DataArray`` objects, which makes it\n+  possible to create a DataArray without using a Dataset. This is highlighted\n+  in the refreshed :doc:`tutorial`.\n+- You can perform aggregation operations like ``mean`` directly on\n+  :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects, thanks to Joe Hamman. These aggregation\n+  methods also worked on grouped datasets.\n+- xray now works on Python 2.6, thanks to Anna Kuznetsova.\n+- A number of methods and attributes were given more sensible (usually shorter)\n+  names: ``labeled`` -> ``sel``,  ``indexed`` -> ``isel``, ``select`` ->\n+  ``select_vars``, ``unselect`` -> ``drop_vars``, ``dimensions`` -> ``dims``,\n+  ``coordinates`` -> ``coords``, ``attributes`` -> ``attrs``.\n+- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.load_data` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.close`\n+  methods for datasets facilitate lower level of control of data loaded from\n+  disk.\n+\n+v0.1.1 (20 May 2014)\n+--------------------\n+\n+xray 0.1.1 is a bug-fix release that includes changes that should be almost\n+entirely backwards compatible with v0.1:\n+\n+- Python 3 support (:issue:`53`)\n+- Required numpy version relaxed to 1.7 (:issue:`129`)\n+- Return numpy.datetime64 arrays for non-standard calendars (:issue:`126`)\n+- Support for opening datasets associated with NetCDF4 groups (:issue:`127`)\n+- Bug-fixes for concatenating datetime arrays (:issue:`134`)\n+\n+Special thanks to new contributors Thomas Kluyver, Joe Hamman and Alistair\n+Miles.\n+\n+v0.1 (2 May 2014)\n+-----------------\n+\n+Initial release.\ndiff --git a/doc/combining.rst b/doc/combining.rst\nindex 4593d410..8c1d79cf 100644\n--- a/doc/combining.rst\n+++ b/doc/combining.rst\n@@ -64,7 +64,12 @@ Of course, ``concat`` also works on ``Dataset`` objects:\n .. ipython:: python\n \n     ds = arr.to_dataset(name='foo')\n-    xr.concat([ds.sel(x='a'), ds.sel(x='b')], 'x')\n+xr.concat([ds.sel(x='a'), ds.sel(x='b')], 'x')\n+\n+# Example using ignore_missing_vars\n+ds1 = xr.Dataset({'a': ('x', [1, 2, 3]), 'b': ('x', [4, 5, 6])})\n+ds2 = xr.Dataset({'a': ('x', [4, 5, 6]), 'c': ('x', [7, 8, 9])})\n+xr.concat([ds1, ds2], 'y', ignore_missing_vars=True)\n \n :py:func:`~xarray.concat` has a number of options which provide deeper control\n over which variables are concatenated and how it handles conflicting variables\n@@ -310,4 +315,4 @@ These functions can be used by :py:func:`~xarray.open_mfdataset` to open many\n files as one dataset.

Instead of asking users to create dummy variables or drop mismatched variables, the function should offer an option to fill missing variables with NaN values or a specified fill value, similar to how `pandas.concat` operates.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nconcat\n_dataset_concat\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. concat: This function currently concatenates xarray objects along a new or existing dimension. It is central to the functionality discussed in the issue since it does not currently handle datasets with missing variables cleanly.\n\n2. _dataset_concat: This helper function is responsible for the actual concatenation of datasets along a specified dimension within the xarray library. Adding functionality to handle missing variables should involve changes to this function.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Introduced a new parameter `ignore_missing_vars` within the `concat` function to allow users to opt-in to filling missing variables with NaN values instead of raising an error.\n2. Updated the `concat` function parameters and docstring to reflect the new `ignore_missing_vars` parameter.\n3. Modified the return statement to pass the new `ignore_missing_vars` parameter to the helper function `_dataset_concat`.\n4. Updated `_dataset_concat` to take the new `ignore_missing_vars` parameter and handle missing variables accordingly. If `ignore_missing_vars` is set to True, it fills the missing variables with a specified fill value.\n5. Added a new test file to verify correctness of the introduced feature when `ignore_missing_vars` is set to True and include scenarios with different fill values and the default behavior being False.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct functions, namely `concat` and `_dataset_concat`, which handle the dataset concatenation logic in xarray. These are the appropriate locations to implement the new functionality and integrate it.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to be introduced by the patch. The relevant condition checks for missing variables based on the `ignore_missing_vars` flag and behaves appropriately by either raising an error or filling missing variables with NaN / specified values. There is no contradiction between the modified code spans and the existing spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly fixes the issue by adding a new parameter `ignore_missing_vars` to handle datasets with different variable sets, allowing users to fill missing variables with NaN values instead of raising an error. Below are some common pitfalls the patch avoids:\n1. Documentation Update - The patch updates the documentation thoroughly with parameter descriptions.\n2. Functional Integration - The patch integrates the new parameter through required helper functions without duplicating code.\n3. Testing - New tests are added confirming new behavior while maintaining existing functionality. \n\nConsidering these factors, the patch addresses the issue effectively and adheres to good coding practices.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It's likely to be modified or extended to handle the new `ignore_missing_vars` parameter and correctly fill missing variables with `NaN`.\n\n3. reindex_variables: This function in the `alignment` module helps reindex variables and fills in missing values with `NaN`.
