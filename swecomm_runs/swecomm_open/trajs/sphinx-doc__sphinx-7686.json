This should resolve the imported members incorrectly being included.\n   \n   Common LLM mistakes such as failing to fully cover edge cases seem to be guarded against by the modified condition.

Config: This span defines the configuration class with various settings, including the introduction of new configuration options like 'autosummary_imported_members'.\n\n2. ModuleDocumenter: The span defines the behavior of documenting modules, relevant for understanding how members of modules are processed.\n\n3. setup: The setup function sets up the Sphinx application with the configuration and documenters. It connects to events and integrates the settings needed to process module members.\n\n4. ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members: This function helps get the members of a module, and it is relevant because it shows how the members are collected based on the settings provided.\n\n5. Documenter.filter_members: This function determines if certain members should be filtered out when documenting, which is relevant for implementing any conditional logic such as removing imported members.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1.

The first hunk adds the logic needed to exclude imported members directly in the autosummary generation function.\n2. The second hunk correctly adds error handling for doc parsing to prevent module failures.\n3. The third hunk doesn't seem directly related to the 'autosummary_imported_members' handling but is included for context.\n4.

The desired behavior is that, when `autosummary_imported_members` is `False`, the `members` variable should not list imported members.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue relates to the `autosummary` feature, where Sphinx is including imported members in the `members` variable for module templates, even when the `autosummary_imported_members` setting is `False`. The expected behavior is for the imported members to be excluded in this configuration.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- List of Span IDs: `Config`, `ModuleDocumenter`, `setup`, `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`, `Documenter.filter_members`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Config`: This class sets up configuration values for Sphinx, including options that might influence the behavior of autosummary.\n- `ModuleDocumenter`: This class specializes in documenting modules and has a direct role in determining which members are included.\n- `setup`: This function sets up various documenters including the `ModuleDocumenter`.\n- `ModuleDocumenter.get_object_members`: This method defines how to gather members for a module, avoiding imported objects based on configuration settings.\n- `Documenter.filter_members`: This method processes members and determines which should be included or skipped based on settings like `autosummary_imported_members`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Evaluate the Candidate Patch:**\n\n- List of Modified Hunks:\n  1. Changes to `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py`, lines around 258 to 276\n  2. Import statement modified in `sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py` lines around 291\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1 (lines around 258 to 276): Modified the method to handle `autosummary` members according to the configuration of `imported_members`. Specifically, it passes `imported_members` as a parameter to the `get_members` function when retrieving methods and attributes.\n- Hunk 2 (lines around 291): A minor import refactor is introduced with an additional global setting for `imported_members` to push this variable into the global state within the function it wraps.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check Correct Location:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch addresses the correct function responsible for generating summaries and managing the visibility and inclusion of module members based on the `autosummary_imported_members` setting. This ensures that the scope is adjusted correctly based on this configuration.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere's no contradictory evidence suggesting this patch introduces any glaring issues or contradicts identified code spans. It takes existing configurations into account while filtering methods and attributes.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by passing the `imported_members` configuration setting within the functions retrieving members. By including this conditional parameter wherever member fetching occurs, it aligns behavior with what's expected when `autosummary_imported_members` is `False`. Nothing indicates common LLM errors like partial completions or incorrect logic application.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Hunk 1 (sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py: 258-276):\n   - Adds `imported=imported_members` to the `get_members` function call when setting the methods and attributes of a class, ensuring imported members are conditionally included.\n2. Hunk 2 (sphinx/ext/autosummary/generate.py: 291-308):\n   - Adds a global variable `_imported_members` which is set by the parameter `imported_members` from the `generate_autosummary_docs` function, propagating this setting.\n3.
