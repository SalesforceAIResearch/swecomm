The function handles recursive string conversion for both SymPy and non-SymPy types, including tuples. Its handling of tuples with appropriate opening and closing braces gives context as to why the print output format and tuple handling are relevant to the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **PythonCodePrinter Class Modification**: \n   - **Added `_print_Tuple` Method**:\n     Before:\n     (no method for handling tuples)\n     After:\n     ```python\n     def _print_Tuple(self, expr):\n        if len(expr) == 1:\n            return '({},)'.format(self._print(expr[0]))\n        return '({})'.format(', '.join(map(self._print, expr)))\n     ```\n     - Check if the tuple has exactly one element and correctly adds a comma to ensure it is recognized as a tuple. Otherwise, it joins elements with commas as expected.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied in the correct location. The `_print` methods in the `PythonCodePrinter` class handle the specific formatting for the generated Python code. The newly introduced `_print_Tuple` method logically falls in this category since the core issue is an incorrect tuple representation in printed code.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any contradictions with the identified code span or new issues. The fix respects the contextual usage of tuples, ensuring it produces output `(1,)` correctly when converting tuples with a single element. This complements `_recursive_to_string` nicely as it adheres to similar formatting logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems appropriate for fixing the issue mentioned. It specifically targets the tuple printing case in `PythonCodePrinter` by checking for single-element tuples and ensuring the comma is included. There are no evident problems based on common mistakes made by LLMs, such as spammy imports, misutilities, or unintended name errors.

In versions up to SymPy 1.9, a tuple with a single element is correctly shown with a trailing comma, indicating it as a tuple. However, in SymPy 1.10, the trailing comma is missing, leading to ambiguity where something that should be a tuple is represented as a regular integer.\n\n<issue_exp>The Python code printer in SymPy is not correctly formatting a tuple with a single element. In older versions (up to 1.9), the output correctly included a trailing comma (e.g., (1,)), but in version 1.10, the comma is missing (e.g., (1)), leading to incorrect representation where a single-element tuple is interpreted as an integer.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- List of Span IDs:\n  - **_recursive_to_string**\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code span `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` relates to the `_recursive_to_string` function.\n- `_recursive_to_string`: This function is responsible for converting different types (including tuples) to their string representations.

Given this logical addition in `__print_Tuple`, it circumvents potential LLM common mistakes like ignoring context checks or introducing syntactical regressions. Therefore, this patch seems appropriate and likely successfully fixes the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Scoring\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using the `lambdify` function in SymPy 1.10 to create a lambda expression that returns a single-element tuple, the Python code printer outputs the tuple without a trailing comma. This results in the code returning a plain integer instead of a single-element tuple. The expected behavior is to return '(1,)' but SymPy 1.10 returns '(1)'.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan IDs: \n- _recursive_to_string\n\n1. _recursive_to_string:\n   - This span contains the `_recursive_to_string(doprint, arg)` function, which is related to the lambdify functionality in SymPy.

This method is indeed responsible for how tuples are outputted when converting to Python code, thus directly addressing the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It incorporates the logic for handling single-element tuples properly. The test file added is relevant for verifying the fix.\n/new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue. The method `_print_Tuple` in its modified form correctly adds a trailing comma for single-element tuples. This resolves the issue where the printer outputs `'(1)'` instead of `'(1,)'`.\n\nChecking common LLM mistakes:\n- Improper function selector: The fix targets the relevant symptom, thus correctly targeting the right logical location.\n- Misordering parameters or conditions: The conciseness shows conditions in the given sequences are not misordered.\n\u0259ndacs\n</fix_issue_exp>\n/(em>{score\uc123}\n"
