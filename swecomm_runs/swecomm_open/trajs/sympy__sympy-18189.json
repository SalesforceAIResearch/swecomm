For example, given the same equation but with different orderings of the symbols, the output should remain consistent when `permute=True`, but it currently does not.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the identified code spans\n\nLet's list the span IDs and then explain how each is relevant to the issue.\n\n- List of span IDs: `diophantine`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- The identified code span (lines 101 to 351) is the `diophantine` function itself. This function's logic handles solving diophantine equations, including factoring and permutations logic. The specific problem relates to how the permutations (if applicable) of the solutions are being generated, which ties directly to various portions of the `diophantine` function.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Hunks modifying lines after line 351 in `diophantine.py`:\n    - Add support for generating all permutations of the solutions when `permute=True`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The modified hunk inserts logic to generate all permutations of the solutions after the existing logic that checks for and applies permutation signs logic. If `permute` is `True`, the patch adds code (lines 352 to 360) to generate all permutations of the existing final solutions using `signed_permutations`.\n\n   The new logic, specifically:\n   - Creates an empty set `permuted_solutions`.\n   - Iterates over each solution in `final_soln`.\n   - Updates `permuted_solutions` with all signed permutations of each solution.\n   - Replaces `final_soln` with `permuted_solutions`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Verify if the patch is addressing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `diophantine` function, which is the correct function to address the issue with solution permutations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for Introduced New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict any of the identified code spans; it's an addition executed after existing permutations logic. There are no new issues critically conflicting with the code spans, but it brings additional computation which should be carefully considered based on the performance implications.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch can fix the issue as it correctly adds logic to generate all signed permutations when `permute=True`, ensuring that all permutation orders yield the same comprehensive set of results. Over-evaluation of signed permutations could surface the issue addressed in the original complaint, meaning different `syms` orders will likely produce the same generalized solutions as demonstrated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nBased on the reviewed explanations, I will now provide a score.\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understand the candidate patch.\n   List of modified hunks: \n   - Original:\n   ```\n   0176) var.sort(key=default_sort_key)\n   0177) if syms:\n   (0178) if not is_sequence(syms):\n   ...\n   ```\n   - Modified:\n   ```  \n   176:  var.sort(key=default_sort_key)\n   ...\n   184:  result = diophantine(eq, param)\n   185:  return {tuple([t[dict_sym_index[i]] for i in var]) for t in result}\n   ...\n\n   ```\n   <patch_exp>\n   The modified hunk introduces an intermediate variable `result`, to store output from `diophantine(eq, param)`. This interim result separates the original recursive call and rearrangement based on `syms`.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n   <correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch is applied to the correct function `diophantine` in `diophantine.py`, addressing identified issues with symbol permutations.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n   <new_issues_exp>No new issues have been identified in the modifications. The function is called recursively as expected and symbols\u2019 order is then reconciled post evaluation across both cases specified in the span.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch can potentially fix the issue by ensuring a uniform evaluation, irrespective of the symbol order:\n   - `perm` flag meaningful in calling `diophantine(eq, param)` first and ceterms only then the tuple structure sorted.\n   \n   Common pitfalls considered:\n   - Passed eq correctly used.\n   - The logic results collected may serve consistent.\n   - Ens cares proper sorted evaluation in every recursive return/precondition correcting varied tuple.\n\n   Therefore, found correct placement of lines inside function use scenarios detecting character transformations valid regions.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
