For example:\n- `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")` should fetch only `id`, but it fetches all fields.\n- `Company.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")` similarly fetches all fields.\nHowever, `Company.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")` works correctly and fetches only `id` and `country`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:** \n\n- List of span ids: `QuerySet.only`, `QuerySet.defer`, `Query.add_immediate_loading`, `Query.add_deferred_loading`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `QuerySet.only`: This method sets immediate loading of specified fields which conflicts with fields specified to be deferred by `defer`. This helps understand where immediate loading fields are set.\n- `QuerySet.defer`: This method sets deferred loading of specified fields. Understanding it is crucial since it should handle clearing deferred fields correctly when chained with `only()`.\n- `Query.add_immediate_loading`: This sets the specific fields which should be loaded immediately the query is executed. Relevant as it overrides deferred fields.\n- `Query.add_deferred_loading`: This sets fields to defer and it should clear corresponding fields set in `only()`, elucidating the current problematic behavior.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Hunk modifying lines 2083-2089 in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The modified hunk updates the method `add_deferred_loading`:\n  - Converts `field_names` to a set for consistent handling.\n  - Special handling for primary keys (`pk`).\n  - Modifies logical handling: Instead of removing field names from the existing \"immediate load\" set, it now replaces all immediate load names.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `add_deferred_loading` to handle clearing immediate load names and integrate the invoked defer calls appropriately.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce new issues directly related with immediate loading/deferred fields logic. However, the solution of converting field names to a set along with handling of primary keys should equally be assessed for contexts having a `Primary Key` or set operations adversely affecting.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch logically aligns with the fix as needed; it clears incorrectly loaded immediate fields while deferring specific fields adheres directly to the issue raised. On the contrary, common issues usually seen with LLM patches include incorrect field manipulations or failing to comply singular usage like chaining, which it avoids effectively here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score:**\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understand the Issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using Django's ORM QuerySet methods `only()` followed by `defer()`, fields explicitly set to be deferred by `defer()` are not being honored. Instead, all fields are loaded, which is against the expected behavior. Specifically, when a field is deferred after specifying some fields to be loaded with `only()`, those deferred fields should not be included in the SQL query.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of Span IDs:\n- QuerySet.only\n- QuerySet.defer\n- Query.add_immediate_loading\n- Query.add_deferred_loading\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `QuerySet.only`: This method is used to specify which fields should be loaded immediately. The method calls `add_immediate_loading` in the query which is central to how deferred fields are handled when using `only()`.\n2. `QuerySet.defer`: This method is used to defer loading of data for specified fields until they are accessed.

Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of Modified Hunks:\n1. Line 2099 - 2111 in `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\nThis modified hunk adjusts the `add_immediate_loading` method. Specifically, it clears any deferred loading settings when `only()` is called by resetting `existing` and `defer` to empty sets and `False`, respectively. This aims to address the issue by ensuring that any previous deferred fields are not brought forward.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `add_immediate_loading` function, which is the correct function to alter since the `only()` method eventually calls this function to set immediate loading fields. Adjusting how deferred fields are handled here is appropriate.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check If the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch clears all deferred fields when `only()` is called, which could potentially override legitimate deferrals specified earlier. There could be an issue if there are contexts where deferred fields are meant to be preserved alongside `only()` invocations. The clearing of existing deferrals might contradict previous uses of `QuerySet.defer`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aims to fix the issue by clearing deferred fields whenever `only()` is called, which is an effective but overly aggressive approach that ensures no deferred fields are loaded. However, this introduces another problem where previous deferred settings are entirely disregarded once `only()` is called, which goes against selective loading principles intended by Django's ORM.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>7</score>"

If we evaluate a queryset containing a .defer() following a .only(), the generated sql query selects unexpected fields. For example:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\")\nloads all the fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nand\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\").defer(\"name\").defer(\"country\")\nalso loads all the fields with the same query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"name\", \"company\".\"trade_number\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\nIn those two cases, I would expect the sql query to be:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\" FROM \"company\"\nIn the following example, we get the expected behavior:\nCompany.objects.only(\"name\", \"country\").defer(\"name\")\nonly loads \"id\" and \"country\" fields with the following query:\nSELECT \"company\".\"id\", \"company\".\"country\" FROM \"company\"\n</issue_description>\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when chaining `only()` and `defer()` methods in querysets, deferred fields are not cleared properly.

Specifically, chaining defer() after only() should only keep fields exclusive to the only() function and defer specified fields inclusive in the only() operation. However, currently on chaining only('name').defer('name') or only('name').defer('name').defer('country'), the query fetches all fields. This should instead load only expected fields mentioned after pre-chaining.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan IDs: [\"QuerySet.defer\", \"QuerySet.only\", \"Query.add_deferred_loading\", \"Query.add_immediate_loading\"]\n\n1. Code Span ID: QuerySet.defer\n    - Context: This method allows the specification of fields that should be loaded lazily by the query.\n    - Relevance: The handling changes in `defer` method directly relate to how it interacts with the `only()` method's fields.\n\n2. Code Span ID: QuerySet.only\n    - Context: This method initiates chain-query in only picking fields to be loaded immediately.\n    - Relevance: Interaction logic with the defer aspect of QuerySet directly affects the bug.\n\n3. Code Span ID: Query.add_deferred_loading\n    - Context: This method allows the specification of fields that should be excluded from loading on querying.\n    - Relevance: This function's deferred loading mechanism influences and affects how defer in defer interacts effectively.\n\n4.
