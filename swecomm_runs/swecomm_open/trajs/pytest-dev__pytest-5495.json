For instance, comparing `b''` with `b'1'` shows that ASCII ordinal 49 is different without making it obvious that it refers to the character '1'.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n\nFirst, here's the list of span ids:\n- AssertionRewriter\n- AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert\n- _compare_eq_sequence\n- assertrepr_compare\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe four identified code spans are related to how assertions are handled and messages are formulated:\n\n- AssertionRewriter (Lines 458-508): This class is responsible for rewriting assertion code into more informative forms.\n- AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert (Lines 663-726): This method handles the rewriting of `assert` statements, turning them into statements that will build explanatory messages when an assertion fails.\n- _compare_eq_sequence (Lines 256-286): This function compares sequences and generates explanations for mismatches.\n- assertrepr_compare (Lines 116-163): This function selects how the assertion failures are presented, directing to the appropriate comparison and message building logic.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understanding the candidate patch:\n\nThe modified hunk includes lines:\n```python\n399:     if isinstance(each_obj[i], bytes) and isinstance(each_obj[i + 1], bytes):\n400:         custom = \"b'{}' != b'{}'\".format(\n401:             each_obj[i].decode('ascii', 'replace'),\n402:             each_obj[i + 1].decode('ascii', 'replace')\n403:         )\n404:         return custom\n405:     elif isinstance(each_obj[i], str) and isinstance(each_obj[i + 1], str):\n406:         custom = \"'{}' != '{}'\".format(\n407:             each_obj[i].replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\"),\n408:             each_obj[i + 1].replace(\"\\n\", \"\\\\n\")\n409:         )\n410:         return custom\n411:     elif isinstance(each_obj[i], (list, tuple)) and isinstance(each_obj[i + 1], (list, tuple)):\n412:         custom = \"{} != {}\".format(\n413:             repr(each_obj[i]),\n414:             repr(each_obj[i + 1])\n415:         )\n416:         return custom\n417:     elif isinstance(each_obj[i], dict) and isinstance(each_obj[i + 1], dict):\n418:         custom = \"{} != {}\".format(\n419:             repr(each_obj[i]),\n420:             repr(each_obj[i + 1])\n421:         )\n422:         return custom\n423:     elif hasattr(each_obj[i], '__dict__') and hasattr(each_obj[i + 1], '__dict__'):\n424:         custom = \"{} != {}\".format(\n425:             repr(each_obj[i]),\n426:             repr(each_obj[i + 1])\n427:         )\n428:         return custom\n429:     else:\n430:         return expl\n```\n\nThis patch modifies assertion handling specifically for byte strings and other types of objects to generate more readable messages.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch adds conditions to check specific types (bytes, str, list/tuple, dict, and objects with `__dict__`) to the explanation building function. When it encounters byte string comparisons, it decodes them to ASCII (replacing un-decodable characters) and formats them into readable strings (`b'message''). Similar changes are made to support more readable output for string, list/tuple, dict, and other custom objects.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking the correct location:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch targets `src/_pytest/assertion/rewrite.py`, where assertion messages are constructed. This is indeed one of the relevant locations where comparisons are formatted for output and thus correct for attempting to fix the issue of confusing byte string comparison output.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Checking for new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any issues as per the scanning of provided identified code spans. The newly added logic remains compatible with existing checks and adds only focused handling for `bytes`, `str`, `list/tuple`, `dict`, and other objects.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Checking if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch solves the problem of unreadable byte string assertion messages by providing a clear format. It decodes the byte strings and presents a concise comparison without confusing ordinal values in the error message. This way, users understand the exact difference in byte representations in an implicit way. The common mistakes by LLMs don't seem to apply here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue concerns a confusing message that pytest generates when comparing byte sequences. The current error messages display byte sequences along with their ASCII ordinal values, which can be hard to understand. The suggested improvement is to make the error messages more readable, possibly by including the ASCII ordinal values.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- Identified span IDs: [AssertionRewriter, AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert, _compare_eq_sequence, assertrepr_compare]\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **AssertionRewriter**: This class is responsible for rewriting assertion statements in tests. It processes the assertions to produce detailed failure messages, making it a central component in how assertion errors are displayed.\n\n2. **AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert**: This method processes individual assertion statements, transforming them into expressions that generate detailed error messages. Changes to how assertions are rewritten would need to be addressed in this method.\n\n3. **_compare_eq_sequence**: This function compares sequences (such as lists or byte sequences) element by element and generates explanations when there is a mismatch. This is directly relevant because it is responsible for the confusing messages mentioned in the issue.\n\n4. **assertrepr_compare**: This function provides specialized assertion explanations for equality checks among different data types, including byte sequences, invoking specialized comparison functions like `_compare_eq_sequence`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n- Modified Hunks:\n  1. **Lines 254-273** in `_compare_eq_sequence`\n  2. **Lines 281-299** in `_compare_eq_sequence`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Lines 256-273**:\n   - Added a condition to check if the mismatched elements in `left` and `right` are byte objects.\n   - If true, it includes their ASCII ordinal values in the message `\"At index {} diff: {!r} != {!r} (ASCII ordinal: {} != {})\"`.\n\n2. **Lines 281-299**:\n   - Added a condition to check if the sequences `left` and `right` are byte objects.\n   - If true, it includes the ASCII ordinal of the extra item in the message with the format: `\"%s contains %d more items, first extra item: %s (ASCII ordinal: %d)\"`\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch changes the `_compare_eq_sequence` function, which is responsible for generating the explanations for sequence mismatches, including byte sequences. This function is indeed the correct place to address the problematic error messages since this is where the original confusing messages are generated.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict any of the identified code spans related to assertion rewriting. It enhances the error messages without disrupting existing functionality. However, extracting the secondary index (`extra[2]`) on line `292` without verifying its length could introduce an error. Though bytes sequences typically don\u2019t have length issues in this context, it should be programmatically checked.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue by including ASCII ordinal values of byte sequence differences in the error message, which clarifies the confusion noted in the original issue. It does this by modifying `__compare_eq_sequence`. These changes directly address the problem without introducing various common mistakes like forgetting type checks or leaving code paths unchanged.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>8</score>"

This aligns well with resolving the format and confusion highlighted in the issue description.\n\nA detailed review:\n1.
