The logic ensures unchanged processing steps for regular matrices while additionally handling instances of MatrixSymbol. The solution cohesively integrates handling MatrixSymbols without contradicting identified code spans.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n\n   **Note:** Additional unit tests specifically designed for different permutations and edge cases with MatrixSymbol integration would be ideally assessed to validate thoroughly, which cannot be done with the artefacts presented.\n\n6. **Checking if the patch fixes the issue:**\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The LLM-generated patch correctly patches the transition points to handle MatrixSymbol. This includes pre-processing to leave MatrixSymbol intact and post-processing to reconstruct MatrixSymbol accurately while executing CSE-related optimizations.\n\n   The patch is aligned logically, encompassing MatrixSymbol consistency, so that output continues recognizing the matrix structure within expressions thus reflecting improvements soon upon simulating through older modern usage patterns as issue IV recognized symptomatic dictates.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score determination:**\n   <score>9</score>"

makes two primary changes:\n1. It adds handling for `MatrixSymbol` in the `for` loop that processes individual expressions within `cse()`:\n   - These symbols are appended directly to the `temp` list instead of being converted like `Matrix` or `SparseMatrix`.\n   - `MatrixSymbol` handling ensures their shape attributes are properly considered.\n\n2. It modifies the postprocessing step to reconstruct `MatrixSymbol` objects back into the result if the processed expression originally contained them:\n   - This ensures that `MatrixSymbol` objects are reverted back correctly after any subexpression elimination and optimization. \n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function. The issues described involve improper handling in the `cse()` function, especially with regards to `MatrixSymbol` objects. The changes are suitably placed in function closures and the parts dealing directly with sub-expressions and assembly of final results.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nI do not see any conflicts or new issues introduced by the patch. Specifically:\n- The patch does not contradict other identified code spans.\n- The logic added appears to only permit `MatrixSymbol` objects' standard handling without interfering with existing logic.\nThe changes are minimal and mostly orthogonal to the rest of the logic and should fit seamlessly within it.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch should logically fix the issue. Missing handling code for `MatrixSymbol` objects is rectified, and this ensures they are systematically processed and retained in cse results. This helps memory consistency as well as assures `MatrixSymbol` objects interplay correctly when indexed in code structures.\nNo prominent errors are introduced both factorial (preserved IDs/processed replacements) nor generate unchecked discrepancies overwritten - they pattern conventions within existing elements & reverts. By this solutions `cse()` appropriates matrix shapes considering elimination(s) along addressed criteria.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

When running a provided example script, the generated substitutions `x0` and `x2` are direct copies of matrices `a` and `b`, but the individual's matrix elements are extracted incorrectly. This issue arises while using `cse()` and interferes with the indexing of matrices within symbolic expressions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nMatrixSymbol, tree_cse, cse\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `MatrixSymbol`: \n   This class represents a symbolic matrix within SymPy. The class generates individual matrix elements during symbolic operations and is directly related to the issue of indexing matrix elements.\n   \n2. `tree_cse`: \n   This function performs common subexpression elimination by analyzing the expression tree and documenting common subexpressions.

Static inclusion such as this patch falls likely into a pattern seen disfavorable for resolving operational core misinterpretation or error extension/uncover. Practical changes exemplary auxiliary method incorporation should strongly emphasize changes reinforcing determination across the complex evaluation chain substituted.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>4</score>"

It uses the `tree_cse` function and optimization preprocessing/postprocessing, which is involved in determining how indexed elements of `MatrixSymbol` are handled in the current implementation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1: Inserts a new helper function `is_matrix_index(expr)` to check if an expression is performing a matrix index operation.\n- Hunk 2: Imports `MatrixSymbol` from `sympy.matrices` into `cse_main.py`. It also inserts the `is_matrix_index` function definition.\n- Hunk 3: The rest of the file adds supporting functions and updates `cse` algorithm annotations and parameters but doesn't modify the core CSE logic significantly in the part shown.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct location. The main logic of CSE, particularly around handling indexed matrix operations, is spread across functions found within `sympy/simplify/cse_main.py` and influenced by the `MatrixSymbol` defined in a separate location (`sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`).\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nIntroducing the `is_matrix_index()` function as patched should be reviewed carefully for cross-calling, especially with customized use cases/expressions involving other types of indexing or function-like constructs within the SymPy context. However, directly scanning the patched sections doesn't currently reveal any conflicting new issues or causes deviating from which might exist in other hidden dependencies.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch touches the appropriate areas to diagnose and mitigate issues stemming from indexed `MatrixSymbol` handling but seems incomplete without ensuring comprehensive modification within `tree_cse()` and `cse()` core algorithm logic checks. Thus the fix appears logically bound but relatively insular, hence probable failure across nested or increasingly diverse symbolic environments owing yet incomplete edge cases encapsulation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"
