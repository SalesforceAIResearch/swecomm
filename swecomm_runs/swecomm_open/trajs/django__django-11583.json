This is confirmed by tracing back the error to this function from the issue stack trace. Therefore, the provided patch is inserted into the correct function, which is where the error is raised.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\nChecking for new issues introduced by the patch:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are apparent upon review. The patch does not contradict any identified code spans and instead focuses on enhancing them by introducing a validation check. The handling of paths is cautious, ensuring paths with embedded null bytes do not trigger the problematic value error.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nChecking if the patch fixes the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears correct as it addresses the exact cause of the error by checking and skipping over paths with embedded null bytes. Introducing `contains_null_byte` tries to mitigate the intermittent error raised by os.readlink(path) as specified in the error message snippet though it may add a reasonable overhead perspective. The implementation integrates well and appropriately with the code and context observed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<count_deduction_points exp>\nFailure to complete evaluation due to exclusion of an escape scenario rendered + potential introspection of encapsulation in resolving stacked dirt cheap stats liable.

By adding a check to skip filenames containing null bytes, it rightly avoids the exception situation. However, it is a surface-level solution that circumvents the symptoms rather than fixing the root cause. Common mistakes seen here include:\n- Not identifying or correcting the root cause (still utilizing `Pathlib` which can fall prey to similar Edge cases).\n- Simply skipping (or ignoring) rather than addressing filenames having null bytes which could highlight problematic setups.\nIt does somewhat mitigate the actual issue since this patch will at least avoid the program breaking; scoring is reflective of this band's surface improvement stance.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"
