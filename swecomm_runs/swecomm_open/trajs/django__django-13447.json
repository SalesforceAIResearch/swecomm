Any modifications in `_build_app_dict` will propagate here.\n\n- **AdminSite.app_index**: This method stands alongside `index` and also utilizes `_build_app_dict`. The transformation to make `_build_app_dict` public impacts this method.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### Modified Hunks:\n1. **Hunk 1: Method Rename and Adding Model Key**\n2. **Hunk 2: Replacing Method Call in `get_app_list`**\n3. **Hunk 3: Replacing Method Call in `index`**\n4. **Hunk 4: Replacing Method Call in `app_index`**\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**: \n   - Changes the method name from `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict`.\n   - Adds the `'model': model` key to the `model_dict` dictionary within the method to make the model class accessible.\n  \n2. **Hunk 2**: \n   - In `get_app_list`, the invocation of `_build_app_dict` is updated to `build_app_dict`.\n   \n3. **Hunk 3**: \n   - Replaces the usage of `_build_app_dict` with `build_app_dict` inside the `index` method.\n  \n4. **Hunk 4**: \n   - Changes `_build_app_dict` to `build_app_dict` call within the `app_index` method.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the modified patch correctly targets the function `AdminSite._build_app_dict` (renamed to `build_app_dict`), and relevant references are updated in `get_app_list`, `index`, and `app_index`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues introduced:\n- The Dictionary now includes the model itself, which was requested.\n- Method calls were methodically updated to use `build_app_dict`.\n  \nThe modifications do not appear to contradict existing functionality based on the provided code spans, as long as accesses are updated accordingly in the calling scopes.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue by making `_build_app_dict` method public and appending the model class to the app dictionary. This approach should effectively meet the request issued. It also methodically replaces the call to the now-public method, addressing the user's needs. This update disproves common LLM mistakes: no partial hunk applications, it targets the correct function, and correctly elaborates changes consistent to ensure environment-wide cohesiveness.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
