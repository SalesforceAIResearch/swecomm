GeometryEntity.__rmul__: This method implements reverse multiplication for geometry entities. It allows for scalar and point objects to be multiplied in an order like `scalar * point`.\n\n2. Point.__mul__: This method handles multiplication of a Point object's coordinates by a factor.

The first hunk starts by importing the `Mul` and `sympify` classes:\n   ```python\n   from sympy import Mul, sympify\n   ```\n   \n2. Then it checks if `other` is an instance of `Mul`:\n   ```python\n   if isinstance(other, Mul):\n   ```\n   \n3. Extracts and segregates the arguments of `Mul` into scalar and point:\n   ```python\n   args = other.args\n   if any(isinstance(arg, Point) for arg in args):\n       point = next(arg for arg in args if isinstance(arg, Point))\n       scalar = sympify(Mul(*[arg for arg in args if not isinstance(arg, Point)]))\n       return self + scalar * point\n   ```\n\n4. The code then reverts to its original behavior using a try-except block with the original functionality within `__add__`:\n   ```python\n   try:\n       s, o = Point._normalize_dimension(self, Point(other, evaluate=False))\n   except TypeError:\n       raise GeometryError(\"Don't know how to add {} and a Point object\".format(other))\n\n   coords = [simplify(a + b) for a, b in zip(s, o)]\n   return Point(coords, evaluate=False)\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is being applied to the correct function, specifically the `Point.__add__` method within `sympy/geometry/point.py`, which is directly handling the addition of Point objects and other entities.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere don\u2019t appear to be any directly new issues resulting from the patch, but the approach introduces runtime dynamic type handling that could marginally affect performance and clarity.

GeometryEntity.__rmul__ \n2. Point.__mul__ \n3. Point.__add__ \n\nExplanation:\n1. `GeometryEntity.__rmul__`: This reverse multiplication method indicates how reverse multiplication (`right multiplication`) should behave for `GeometryEntity` instances. It's key in the fix because the second operand (the `Point`) relies on this method in the arithmetic operation.\n2. `Point.__mul__`: This method pulls the multiplication logic for `Point` instances. It's pertinent to the issue as it defines how coordinates of `Point` objects are handled when multiplying by a scalar factor.\n3. `Point.__add__`: This method contains the logic for adding another value to a `Point`. The fix in question appears due to the error encountered when the second operand is processed, requiring handling if it's not directly another `Point`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of Modified Hunks:\n1. New Method Addition\n2. Implementation of `__rmul__` \n\nExplanation:\n1. A new method `__rmul__` has been added to the `Point` class which implements right multiplication to support number * `Point`.\n2. The `__rmul__` method ensures that reverse multiplication adheres to using the same logic as the multiply method by invoking `self.__mul__(factor)`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly adds `__rmul__` on the `Point` class, addressing the functionality required for resolving the issue where scalar multiplication precedes adding a `Point`.\nHence, the function in which the modification is introduced (`Point` class) is appropriate and relevant to resolving the reported error, as it enables the operation `number * Point`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans (`GeometryEntity.__rmul__`, `Point.__mul__`, `Point.__add__`). The addition lies within the implementation constraints of `Point` and aligns functionally with other defined methods.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch looks like it fixes the original issue raised since it computes reverse multiplication correctly by defining the `__rmul__` method and delegates multiplication using `__mul__`'s logic. One avoided common mistake was diverging logic or circular dependencies, but consulting code domains and integration context, it doesn't misdirect appropriately balancing adding crucial handling in the `Point`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>\n</body>\n</html>"
