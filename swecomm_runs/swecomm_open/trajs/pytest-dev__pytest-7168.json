The example provided demonstrates this error through a custom class `SomeClass` where both `__getattribute__` and `__repr__` raise exceptions. When attempting to run a test that accesses an attribute of an instance of `SomeClass`, pytest ends up with an `INTERNALERROR` instead of gracefully handling the exception.\n\n   <issue_exp>This issue is about handling exceptions correctly in the __repr__ method in pytest. When an exception is raised within the __repr__ method, pytest throws an INTERNALERROR, failing to handle the scenario gracefully.</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n   - List of span IDs: `ExceptionInfo.__repr__`, `Node._repr_failure_py`, `Function.repr_failure`, `TestReport.__repr__`\n\n    For each of the code spans:\n    - **ExceptionInfo.__repr__ (src/_pytest/_code/code.py)**:\n      This span is relevant because it defines the `__repr__` method for `ExceptionInfo`, which needs to handle exceptions correctly and format a representation string. The safe handling here can serve as a model for the patch.\n    - **Node._repr_failure_py (src/_pytest/nodes.py)**:\n      This span represents the method responsible for generating failure representations.

Issue Fix Verification\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue described and adopts a common defensive programming pattern of wrapping potentially error-throwing operations in a try-catch block. This method should correctly handle unexpected exceptions by returning a simplified, safe message. It does not fixate on specific mistake patterns found in automatically generated code patches generally.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Score\n\n<score>7</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the Issue**\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue arises from a test in pytest that triggers an `INTERNALERROR` due to the raising of an exception inside the `__repr__` method. When `repr` is called on an object of class `SomeClass`, which intentionally raises an exception in its `__repr__` method, pytest incorrectly attempts to handle the exception, leading to a `RuntimeError: No active exception to reraise` error. This results in the test failing without running any tests.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**\n\nSpan IDs: `ExceptionInfo.__repr__`, `Node._repr_failure_py`, `Function.repr_failure`, `TestReport.__repr__`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `ExceptionInfo.__repr__`: This span shows how exceptions are represented when `__repr__` is called. It is crucial to ensure that kapproprian exception handling within `__repr__` follows the conventions set by this span.\n  \n- `Node._repr_failure_py`: This span indicates how `Node` handles `repr` failures of exceptions. It must be robust enough to tackle exceptions raised in `__repr__`.\n\n- `Function.repr_failure`: This function calls `_repr_failure_py` on exception information. This method chains to the span above and highlights the importance of correct `repr` style processing.\n  \n- `TestReport.__repr__`: This span shows the `__repr__` method of test reports. Handling should account for possible failures and provide a safe string representation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n\nModified Hunks:\n- Hun 1: `saferepr.py` changes related to `_format_repr_exception`, `safe_repr`, `SafeRepr`, and `saferepr`, adding enhanced exception handling and handling of unknown attributes.\n  \n- Hunk 2: Additions in `test_repr_exception.py` containing the test cases demonstrating the original reported issue.\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk 1:\n- Lines of `_format_repr_exception()` were modified to add robust exception handling, ensuring cases where the obj's `repr` fails are safely handled.\n- Functions `safe_getattr` and `safe_repr` were introduced for safely fetching attributes and creating the `repr`.\n- Updates to the `SafeRepr` class methods to use newly defined safe wrappers in place of direct `repr` calls.\n- Definition of new methods `_safe_repr` and `_handle_repr_exception` to manage error handling consistently within `SafeRepr`.\n- Modification in `saferepr` to integrate with `safe_repr`.\n\nHunk 2:\n- `test_repr_exception.py` includes tests to verify that errors in `__repr__` and `__getattribute__` attributes are handled correctly without breaking the test session.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct Function Location Check**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the relevant function and utility placements in the `saferepr.py` since it directly affects how objects' representations are handled within pytest's safety wrappers, addressing the error in the `__repr__` exception raised in the issue description. It appropriately builds failsafe handling mechanisms needed for `_getrepr`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Identify New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe changes do not appear to conflict with previously defined identified spans. Methods `saferepr` or `__repr__` functionality of other objects. It ensures consistency in handling by incorporating getter safety wrappers (`safe_getattr` and `safe_repr`) in existing SafeRepr loosely coupling similar codebase sections by standardized error resolution methods. Therefore, no new issues are introduced.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Fix Issue Check**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses exception handling in `__repr__` while keeping stability across other functionalities (_format, sys_exit handlers). Introduced methods such as `safe_getattr` and `safe_repr` embed this safely ensuring consistent failure handling and debugging utility. Therefore, fixing initial test cases and set improving readability, extensibility, enabling pytest robustness uptick holistically redefine repr investigations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Errors during this representation process may be related to the observed error as well.\n3. `Function.repr_failure`: Similar to `_repr_failure_py`, this focuses on depicting how a failure in a function is represented as a string. This is another place that may be causing the internal error if the representation fails.\n4. `TestReport.__repr__`: It dictates how a `TestReport` object is converted to a string and could throw or mask representation issues if it encounters unexpected conditions while formatting it.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Modified Hunks:**\n1.

Import Section in file `test_repr_exception.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. `src/_pytest/_io/(saferepr.py)` starting from line 15:\n   - Adds `safe_getattr` to retrieve attributes safely.\n   - Modifies `_format_repr_exception` to handle attribute retrieval safely, and capture additional context or fallback values if an exception arises during representation.\n2. `src/_pytest/_io/(saferepr.py)` starting from line 53:\n   - Modifies several `SafeRepr` class methods (`repr`, `repr1`, `repr_instance`) to default safely when an error is encountered during representation.\n   - Introduces helper methods for dealing with safe representation and exception handling during `repr`.\n3. Added `test_repr_exception.py`:\n   - Adds tests to handle the specific exceptions arising due to `__getattribute__` and `__repr__` failing to ensure the patch resolves the issue as intended.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the candidate patch modifies the correct function and relevant sections of the code dealing with representation (`repr`). These changes are directly refining and consistently improving error handling mechanisms within these pytest internals.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no contradictions between the identified code spans and the patch itself; it builds directly on improving the overall robustness of the `repr` methods aligned with managing exceptions from failing representations. However, potential unexpected issues can still arise if there're unassessed coverage areas or newer/all unforeseen variations of errors appear.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, this patch effectively addresses the original problem by ensuring it's catching exceptions when performing `repr` and `getattr` thereby preventing runtime errors from uncaught exceptions. The inclusion of adequately placed safeguard methods (`safe_repr`, `safe_getattr`) significantly reduces the probability of hazardous failures in the future.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
