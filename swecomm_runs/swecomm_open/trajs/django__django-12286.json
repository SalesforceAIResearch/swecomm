According to the Django documentation, if a base language (e.g., 'de' for German) is available but the sublanguage (e.g., 'de-at' for Austrian German) is not, Django should use the base language. However, in Django 3.0.2, if a base language is available but not the specified sublanguage in `LANGUAGE_CODE`, it raises a validation error `translation.E004`. This does not conform to Django's documentation.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is with Django raising a 'translation.E004' error when a sublanguage code (e.g., 'de-at') is set in `LANGUAGE_CODE` but the base language (e.g., 'de') is available in the `LANGUAGES` setting. Django should use the base language if the specified sublanguage is not available, rather than raising an error.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**List of Span IDs:**\n- check_language_settings_consistent\n\n**Explanation of Each Code Span:**\n\n- **Span ID `check_language_settings_consistent`:** This function is responsible for verifying the consistency of language settings. Specifically, it checks whether the `LANGUAGE_CODE` setting is included in the available tags derived from `settings.LANGUAGES`. The identified span directly relates to the issue because it contains the logic that determines when the `translation.E004` error is raised if the `LANGUAGE_CODE` is not found in the `LANGUAGES` setting.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span ID `check_language_settings_consistent`: This code span includes the function `check_language_settings_consistent` that checks if `LANGUAGE_CODE` is part of the available language tags in `settings.LANGUAGES`.

It splits the `LANGUAGE_CODE` at the hyphen and checks both the full code and just the base code against the available tags.\n\n```python\n59:     language_code = settings.LANGUAGE_CODE\n60:     base_language_code = language_code.split('-')[0]\n61:     if language_code not in available_tags and base_language_code not in available_tags:\n```\nThis modification ensures that it doesn't raise an error if either the whole `LANGUAGE_CODE` or its base part exists in available tags.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `check_language_settings_consistent` function to include a check for both the full `LANGUAGE_CODE` and its base language (the part before the hyphen). Specifically, it now gets `LANGUAGE_CODE` from settings, extracts the base language by splitting the code at '-', and then verifies that either the complete code or the base code is in the available language tags. If neither is found, it raises the `translation.E004` error.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\nThe patch accurately modifies the `check_language_settings_consistent` function, which is responsible for raising the `translation.E004` error based on the `LANGUAGE_CODE`. This function is directly relevant to the issue described.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `check_language_settings_consistent`, which is responsible for checking and raising the `translation.E004` error if `LANGUAGE_CODE` is not found in available languages.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. The changes do not conflict with the identified code spans and are logically consistent with the expected behavior described in Django's documentation:\n- It correctly adds a check for the base language part of `LANGUAGE_CODE`.\n  \n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and is consistent with the identified code spans. The additional checks ensure the system correctly verifies both a sublanguage and its base language, aligned with Django's intended functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue by ensuring that if the sublanguage specified in `LANGUAGE_CODE` is not available, it checks if the base language is available before raising `translation.E004`. This effectively aligns the behavior with Django's documentation.\n\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively resolves the issue by modifying the `check_language_settings_consistent` function to check both the full language code and the base language code.

According to the Django documentation, if a base language (e.g., 'de') is available but a specific sublanguage (e.g., 'de-at') is not, Django should fall back to the base language. However, when setting LANGUAGE_CODE to 'de-at' in Django 3.0.2, there is an error stating that the value is not in the LANGUAGES setting. This behavior is not observed with 'es-ar', which works fine.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nFirst, let's list the span IDs: \n- check_language_settings_consistent\n\nNow, let's explain each identified code span:\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span check_language_settings_consistent is a function that checks the consistency of language settings. Specifically, it verifies if `settings.LANGUAGE_CODE` exists in `settings.LANGUAGES`. If it does not, it returns an error [(translation.E004)]. This check is directly related to the reported issue, as it explains why LANGUAGE_CODE 'de-at' is not recognized if it's not explicitly listed in LANGUAGES.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk 1: Lines 418-429 in `django/utils/translation/trans_real.py`\n\nNow, let's explain the modified hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe hunk modifies the function that checks for accepted language codes. Originally, if strict mode was off and a variant language code like 'fr-fr' was not supported, it would look for and return other forms like 'fr-ca' if they exist. The patch introduces a fallback mechanism by additionally checking for the base language code (e.g., 'fr'). If the sublanguage ('fr-fr') and other language codes ('fr-ca') are not found, it will return the base language code ('fr') if it's present in the supported languages.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check Correct Function Location\n\nLet's verify if the patch addresses the right function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the function responsible for selecting appropriate language codes based on `LANGUAGE_CODE`. This function is directly involved in resolving the fallbacks for languages including sublanguages, making it the correct place to apply this change.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\nLet's identify if the patch introduces any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to be introduced by this patch, and it does not contradict the identified code span in `translation.py`. The central logic is preserved, while adding a fallback mechanism, which does not seem to interfere with other functionalities or conditions checked in the system.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\nDetermining if the patch effectively fixes the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the specific problem noted in the issue description by adding a mechanism to fallback to the base language when sublanguages are not found. It adheres to the behavior described in `Django's documentation`, ensuring that if 'de-at' is not present but 'de' is, 'de' will be used without raising an error. This ensures that the root cause of the issue (running into an error which should not appear according to documentation) is resolved.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score the Patch\n\nAfter considering the correctness of the applied patch:\n\n<score>10</score>"

It integrates an efficient mechanism recognizing base languages when sublanguages are specified, preventing unnecessary `E004` errors. This logic adheres to the provided Django documentation rule without noticeable mistakes typically bound to LLM-generated code, such as inappropriate syntax or missing conditions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score.**\n\n<score>9</score>"
