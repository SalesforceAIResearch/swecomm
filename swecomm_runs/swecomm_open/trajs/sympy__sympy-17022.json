Understand the Identified Code Spans\nLet's list the span ids first and then explain their relevance.\n\n- Identify code spans: Identity, JuliaCodePrinter._print_Identity, LatexPrinter._print_Identity, StrPrinter._print_Identity, imports, lambdify\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Identity`: Contains the definition of the `Identity` matrix class.\n- `JuliaCodePrinter._print_Identity`: Handles printing the `Identity` matrix in Julia code.\n- `LatexPrinter._print_Identity`: Handles printing the `Identity` matrix in LaTeX.\n- `StrPrinter._print_Identity`: Handles printing of `Identity` matrix in string representation.\n- `imports`: Settings for symbol imports in Theanocode.\n- `lambdify`: Contains the main function `lambdify` that lets sympy expressions interact with numerical libraries like NumPy.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\nNow let's list the changed hunks and explain each one of them.\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. hunk_mod_1 (lines 105 to 113 in `a/sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`)\n2. hunk_mod_2 (lines 703 to 719 in `a/sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`)\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1 (Adding import statement)\n  ```python\n  113: from sympy.printing.pycode import NumPyPrinter`. \n  ```\n  Explanation: This hunk imports `NumPyPrinter` early in the file, establishing dependency required by the custom class later on.\n\n- Hunk 2 (Custom NumPyPrinter definition and its usage)\n  ```python\n  013:     class CustomNumPyPrinter(NumPyPrinter):\n  714:         def _print_Identity(self, expr):\n  715:             return \"numpy.eye(%s)\" % expr.args[0]\n  716:     Printer = CustomNumPyPrinter\n  ```\n  Explanation: Defines a custom printer that translates the `Identity` matrix into numpy eye function correctly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the correct function. The `lambdify` function is the target for supporting translation of matrix expressions into numpy compatible formats, making it the right place for the fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce new issues within the identified code spans. The added custom printer properly inherits from `NumPyPrinter`, encapsulating new printing capabilities specifically for `Identity` matrices.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\nPros: \n- The approach of using a custom NumPy printer to handle identity matrices seems logical and effective.\n  \nCommon LLM Mistake Considerations:\n- Incorrect contextual inheritance: Here, `CustomNumPyPrinter` correctly extends `NumPyPrinter`.\n- Variable mishandlings in lambdify: The patch respects existing translator structures for other Sympy to NumPy support ensuring there is no cascading failure in lambdify inherent conversion mechanisms.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully handles the core issue of translating `Identity` matrices in `lambdify`. There isn't an apparent breakdown addressed by typical LLM generative errors. It thereby resolves the specified misinterpretation effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\nAs there are no major logical flow issues or contextual misdirections, the patch merits a high score.\n\n<score>9</score>"

The function `_print_Identity` has been added within `pycode.py`, which is the correct file considering that PyCodePrinter is part of the library generating code that `lambdify` uses.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce immediate new issues. However, merging nested lists when stringifying the shape parameter might have unforeseen consequences in very complex code bases but for now, there is no direct contradiction or violation of other identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to correctly address the issue noted. Adding the `_print_Identity` method ensures that matrices are represented correctly in the generated function and this should fix the misinterpretation of Identity matrices as noted in the issue. The patch correctly utilizes the numpy command to create an identity matrix ensuring consistent and expected behavior from the `lambdify` function. However, examining common mistakes from LLMs:\n- It does not handle input shape guards which could cause runtime issues if shape assumptions are not met.\n- The change might be prone to missed deep-nested identity. \n\nGiven it handles fundamental conversion correctly, it addresses the primary issue effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

In general, SymPy functions do not work with objects from\n+    other libraries, such as NumPy arrays, and functions from numeric\n+    libraries like NumPy or mpmath do not work on SymPy expressions.\n+    ``lambdify`` bridges the two by converting a SymPy expression to an\n+    equivalent numeric function.\n+\n+    # Handle Identity matrix\n+    from sympy import Identity, MatrixSymbol\n+    if isinstance(expr, MatrixSymbol) and expr.func == Identity:\n+        return lambda n: np.eye(n)\n+\n+    The basic workflow with ``lambdify`` is to first create a SymPy expression\n+    representing whatever mathematical function you wish to evaluate. This\n+    should be done using only SymPy functions and expressions. Then, use\n+    ``lambdify`` to convert this to an equivalent function for numerical\n+    evaluation. For instance, above we created ``expr`` using the SymPy symbol\n+    ``x`` and SymPy functions ``sin`` and ``cos``, then converted it to an\n+    equivalent NumPy function ``f``, and called it on a NumPy array ``a``.\n+\n+    .. warning::\n+       This function uses ``exec``, and thus shouldn't be used on unsanitized\n+       input.\n+\n+    Arguments\n+    =========\n+\n+    The first argument of ``lambdify`` is a variable or list of variables in\n+    the expression. Variable lists may be nested. Variables can be Symbols,\n+    undefined functions, or matrix symbols. The order and nesting of the\n+    variables corresponds to the order and nesting of the parameters passed to\n+    the lambdified function. For instance,\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z\n+    >>> f = lambdify([x, (y, z)], x + y + z)\n+    >>> f(1, (2, 3))\n+    6\n+\n+    The second argument of ``lambdify`` is the expression, list of\n+    expressions, or matrix to be evaluated. Lists may be nested. If the\n+    expression is a list, the output will also be a list.\n+\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, [x, [x + 1, x + 2]])\n+    >>> f(1)\n+    [1, [2, 3]]\n+\n+    If it is a matrix, an array will be returned (for the NumPy module).\n+\n+    >>> from sympy import Matrix\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, Matrix([x, x + 1]))\n+    >>> f(1)\n+    [[1]\n+     [2]]\n+\n+    Note that the argument order here, variables then expression, is used to\n+    emulate the Python ``lambda`` keyword. ``lambdify(x, expr)`` works\n+    (roughly) like ``lambda x: expr`` (see :ref:`lambdify-how-it-works` below).\n+\n+    The third argument, ``modules`` is optional. If not specified, ``modules``\n+    defaults to ``[\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]`` if SciPy is installed, ``[\"numpy\"]`` if\n+    only NumPy is installed, and ``[\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]`` if neither is\n+    installed. That is, SymPy functions are replaced as far as possible by\n+    either ``scipy`` or ``numpy`` functions if available, and Python's\n+    standard library ``math``, or ``mpmath`` functions otherwise.\n+\n+    ``modules`` can be one of the following types\n+\n+     - the strings ``\"math\"``, ``\"mpmath\"``, ``\"numpy\"``, ``\"numexpr\"``,\n+       ``\"scipy\"``, ``\"sympy\"``, or ``\"tensorflow\"``. This uses the\n+       corresponding printer and namespace mapping for that module.\n+     - a module (e.g., ``math``). This uses the global namespace of the\n+       module. If the module is one of the above known modules, it will also\n+       use the corresponding printer and namespace mapping (i.e.,\n+       ``modules=numpy`` is equivalent to ``modules=\"numpy\"``).\n+     - a dictionary that maps names of SymPy functions to arbitrary functions\n+       (e.g., ``{'sin': custom_sin}``).\n+     - a list that contains a mix of the arguments above, with higher priority\n+       given to entries appearing first (e.g., to use the NumPy module but\n+       override the ``sin`` function with a custom version, you can use\n+       ``[{'sin': custom_sin}, 'numpy']``).\n+\n+    The ``dummify`` keyword argument controls whether or not the variables in\n+    the provided expression that are not valid Python identifiers are\n+    substituted with dummy symbols. This allows for undefined functions like\n+    ``Function('f')(t)`` to be supplied as arguments. By default, the\n+    variables are only dummified if they are not valid Python identifiers. Set\n+    ``dummify=True`` to replace all arguments with dummy symbols (if ``args``\n+    is not a string) - for example, to ensure that the arguments do not\n+    redefine any built-in names.\n+\n+    .. _lambdify-how-it-works:\n+\n+    How it works\n+    ============\n+\n+    When using this function, it helps a great deal to have an idea of what it\n+    is doing. At its core, lambdify is nothing more than a namespace\n+    translation, on top of a special printer that makes some corner cases work\n+    properly.\n+\n+    To understand lambdify, first we must properly understand how Python\n+    namespaces work. Say we had two files. One called ``sin_cos_sympy.py``,\n+    with\n+\n+    .. code:: python\n+\n+        # sin_cos_sympy.py\n+\n+        from sympy import sin, cos\n+\n+        def sin_cos(x):\n+            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n+\n+\n+    and one called ``sin_cos_numpy.py`` with\n+\n+    .. code:: python\n+\n+        # sin_cos_numpy.py\n+\n+        from numpy import sin, cos\n+\n+        def sin_cos(x):\n+            return sin(x) + cos(x)\n+\n+    The two files define an identical function ``sin_cos``. However, in the\n+    first file, ``sin`` and ``cos`` are defined as the SymPy ``sin`` and\n+    ``cos``. In the second, they are defined as the NumPy versions.\n+\n+    If we were to import the first file and use the ``sin_cos`` function, we\n+    would get something like\n+\n+    >>> from sin_cos_sympy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n+    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n+    cos(1) + sin(1)\n+\n+    On the other hand, if we imported ``sin_cos`` from the second file, we\n+    would get\n+\n+    >>> from sin_cos_numpy import sin_cos # doctest: +SKIP\n+    >>> sin_cos(1) # doctest: +SKIP\n+    1.38177329068\n+\n+    In the first case we got a symbolic output, because it used the symbolic\n+    ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions from SymPy. In the second, we got a numeric\n+    result, because ``sin_cos`` used the numeric ``sin`` and ``cos`` functions\n+    from NumPy. But notice that the versions of ``sin`` and ``cos`` that were\n+    used was not inherent to the ``sin_cos`` function definition. Both\n+    ``sin_cos`` definitions are exactly the same. Rather, it was based on the\n+    names defined at the module where the ``sin_cos`` function was defined.\n+\n+    The key point here is that when function in Python references a name that\n+    is not defined in the function, that name is looked up in the \"global\"\n+    namespace of the module where that function is defined.\n+\n+    Now, in Python, we can emulate this behavior without actually writing a\n+    file to disk using the ``exec`` function. ``exec`` takes a string\n+    containing a block of Python code, and a dictionary that should contain\n+    the global variables of the module. It then executes the code \"in\" that\n+    dictionary, as if it were the module globals. The following is equivalent\n+    to the ``sin_cos`` defined in ``sin_cos_sympy.py``:\n+\n+    >>> import sympy\n+    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': sympy.sin, 'cos': sympy.cos}\n+    >>> exec('''\n+    ... def sin_cos(x):\n+    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n+    ... ''', module_dictionary)\n+    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n+    >>> sin_cos(1)\n+    cos(1) + sin(1)\n+\n+    and similarly with ``sin_cos_numpy``:\n+\n+    >>> import numpy\n+    >>> module_dictionary = {'sin': numpy.sin, 'cos': numpy.cos}\n+    >>> exec('''\n+    ... def sin_cos(x):\n+    ...     return sin(x) + cos(x)\n+    ... ''', module_dictionary)\n+    >>> sin_cos = module_dictionary['sin_cos']\n+    >>> sin_cos(1)\n+    1.38177329068\n+\n+    So now we can get an idea of how ``lambdify`` works. The name \"lambdify\"\n+    comes from the fact that we can think of something like ``lambdify(x,\n+    sin(x) + cos(x), 'numpy')`` as ``lambda x: sin(x) + cos(x)``, where\n+    ``sin`` and ``cos`` come from the ``numpy`` namespace. This is also why\n+    the symbols argument is first in ``lambdify``, as opposed to most SymPy\n+    functions where it comes after the expression: to better mimic the\n+    ``lambda`` keyword.\n+\n+    ``lambdify`` takes the input expression (like ``sin(x) + cos(x)``) and\n+\n+    1. Converts it to a string\n+    2. Creates a module globals dictionary based on the modules that are\n+       passed in (by default, it uses the NumPy module)\n+    3. Creates the string ``\"def func({vars}): return {expr}\"``, where ``{vars}`` is the\n+       list of variables separated by commas, and ``{expr}`` is the string\n+       created in step 1., then ``exec``s that string with the module globals\n+       namespace and returns ``func``.\n+\n+    In fact, functions returned by ``lambdify`` support inspection. So you can\n+    see exactly how they are defined by using ``inspect.getsource``, or ``??`` if you\n+    are using IPython or the Jupyter notebook.\n+\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x) + cos(x))\n+    >>> import inspect\n+    >>> print(inspect.getsource(f))\n+    def _lambdifygenerated(x):\n+        return (sin(x) + cos(x))\n+\n+    This shows us the source code of the function, but not the namespace it\n+    was defined in. We can inspect that by looking at the ``__globals__``\n+    attribute of ``f``:\n+\n+    >>> f.__globals__['sin']\n+    <ufunc 'sin'>\n+    >>> f.__globals__['cos']\n+    <ufunc 'cos'>\n+    >>> f.__globals__['sin'] is numpy.sin\n+    True\n+\n+    This shows us that ``sin`` and ``cos`` in the namespace of ``f`` will be\n+    ``numpy.sin`` and ``numpy.cos``.\n+\n+    Note that there are some convenience layers in each of these steps, but at\n+    the core, this is how ``lambdify`` works. Step 1 is done using the\n+    ``LambdaPrinter`` printers defined in the printing module (see\n+    :mod:`sympy.printing.lambdarepr`). This allows different SymPy expressions\n+    to define how they should be converted to a string for different modules.\n+    You can change which printer ``lambdify`` uses by passing a custom printer\n+    in to the ``printer`` argument.\n+\n+    Step 2 is augmented by certain translations. There are default\n+    translations for each module, but you can provide your own by passing a\n+    list to the ``modules`` argument. For instance,\n+\n+    >>> def mysin(x):\n+    ...     print('taking the sin of', x)\n+    ...     return numpy.sin(x)\n+    ...\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), [{'sin': mysin}, 'numpy'])\n+    >>> f(1)\n+    taking the sin of 1\n+    0.8414709848078965\n+\n+    The globals dictionary is generated from the list by merging the\n+    dictionary ``{'sin': mysin}`` and the module dictionary for NumPy. The\n+    merging is done so that earlier items take precedence, which is why\n+    ``mysin`` is used above instead of ``numpy.sin``.\n+\n+    If you want to modify the way ``lambdify`` works for a given function, it\n+    is usually easiest to do so by modifying the globals dictionary as such.\n+    In more complicated cases, it may be necessary to create and pass in a\n+    custom printer.\n+\n+    Finally, step 3 is augmented with certain convenience operations, such as\n+    the addition of a docstring.\n+\n+    Understanding how ``lambdify`` works can make it easier to avoid certain\n+    gotchas when using it. For instance, a common mistake is to create a\n+    lambdified function for one module (say, NumPy), and pass it objects from\n+    another (say, a SymPy expression).\n+\n+    For instance, say we create\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, x + 1, 'numpy')\n+\n+    Now if we pass in a NumPy array, we get that array plus 1\n+\n+    >>> import numpy\n+    >>> a = numpy.array([1, 2])\n+    >>> f(a)\n+    [2 3]\n+\n+    But what happens if you make the mistake of passing in a SymPy expression\n+    instead of a NumPy array:\n+\n+    >>> f(x + 1)\n+    x + 2\n+\n+    This worked, but it was only by accident. Now take a different lambdified\n+    function:\n+\n+    >>> from sympy import sin\n+    >>> g = lambdify(x, x + sin(x), 'numpy')\n+\n+    This works as expected on NumPy arrays:\n+\n+    >>> g(a)\n+    [1.84147098 2.90929743]\n+\n+    But if we try to pass in a SymPy expression, it fails\n+\n+    >>> g(x + 1)\n+    Traceback (most recent call last):\n+    ...\n+    AttributeError: 'Add' object has no attribute 'sin'\n+\n+    Now, let's look at what happened. The reason this fails is that ``g``\n+    calls ``numpy.sin`` on the input expression, and ``numpy.sin`` does not\n+    know how to operate on a SymPy object. **As a general rule, NumPy\n+    functions do not know how to operate on SymPy expressions, and SymPy\n+    functions do not know how to operate on NumPy arrays. This is why lambdify\n+    exists: to provide a bridge between SymPy and NumPy.**\n+\n+    However, why is it that ``f`` did work? That's because ``f`` doesn't call\n+    any functions, it only adds 1. So the resulting function that is created,\n+    ``def _lambdifygenerated(x): return x + 1`` does not depend on the globals\n+    namespace it is defined in. Thus it works, but only by accident. A future\n+    version of ``lambdify`` may remove this behavior.\n+\n+    Be aware that certain implementation details described here may change in\n+    future versions of SymPy. The API of passing in custom modules and\n+    printers will not change, but the details of how a lambda function is\n+    created may change. However, the basic idea will remain the same, and\n+    understanding it will be helpful to understanding the behavior of\n+    lambdify.\n+\n+    **In general: you should create lambdified functions for one module (say,\n+    NumPy), and only pass it input types that are compatible with that module\n+    (say, NumPy arrays).** Remember that by default, if the ``module``\n+    argument is not provided, ``lambdify`` creates functions using the NumPy\n+    and SciPy namespaces.\n+\n+    Examples\n+    ========\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.utilities.lambdify import implemented_function\n+    >>> from sympy import sqrt, sin, Matrix\n+    >>> from sympy import Function\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import w, x, y, z\n+\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, x**2)\n+    >>> f(2)\n+    4\n+    >>> f = lambdify((x, y, z), [z, y, x])\n+    >>> f(1,2,3)\n+    [3, 2, 1]\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, sqrt(x))\n+    >>> f(4)\n+    2.0\n+    >>> f = lambdify((x, y), sin(x*y)**2)\n+    >>> f(0, 5)\n+    0.0\n+    >>> row = lambdify((x, y), Matrix((x, x + y)).T, modules='sympy')\n+    >>> row(1, 2)\n+    Matrix([[1, 3]])\n+\n+    ``lambdify`` can be used to translate SymPy expressions into mpmath\n+    functions. This may be preferable to using ``evalf`` (which uses mpmath on\n+    the backend) in some cases.\n+\n+    >>> import mpmath\n+    >>> f = lambdify(x, sin(x), 'mpmath')\n+    >>> f(1)\n+    0.8414709848078965\n+\n+    Tuple arguments are handled and the lambdified function should\n+    be called with the same type of arguments as were used to create\n+    the function:\n+\n+    >>> f = lambdify((x, (y, z)), x + y)\n+    >>> f(1, (2, 4))\n+    3\n+\n+    The ``flatten`` function can be used to always work with flattened\n+    arguments:\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.utilities.iterables import flatten\n+    >>> args = w, (x, (y, z))\n+    >>> vals = 1, (2, (3, 4))\n+    >>> f = lambdify(flatten(args), w + x + y + z)\n+    >>> f(*flatten(vals))\n+    10\n+\n+    Functions present in ``expr`` can also carry their own numerical\n+    implementations, in a callable attached to the ``_imp_`` attribute. This\n+    can be used with undefined functions using the ``implemented_function``\n+    factory:\n+\n+    >>> f = implemented_function(Function('f'), lambda x: x+1)\n+    >>> func = lambdify(x, f(x))\n+    >>> func(4)\n+    5\n+\n+    ``lambdify`` always prefers ``_imp_`` implementations to implementations\n+    in other namespaces, unless the ``use_imps`` input parameter is False.\n+\n+    Usage with Tensorflow:\n+\n+    >>> import tensorflow as tf\n+    >>> from sympy import Max, sin\n+    >>> f = Max(x, sin(x))\n+    >>> func = lambdify(x, f, 'tensorflow')\n+    >>> result = func(tf.constant(1.0))\n+    >>> print(result) # a tf.Tensor representing the result of the calculation\n+    Tensor(\"Maximum:0\", shape=(), dtype=float32)\n+    >>> sess = tf.Session()\n+    >>> sess.run(result) # compute result\n+    1.0\n+    >>> var = tf.Variable(1.0)\n+    >>> sess.run(tf.global_variables_initializer())\n+    >>> sess.run(func(var)) # also works for tf.Variable and tf.Placeholder\n+    1.0\n+    >>> tensor = tf.constant([[1.0, 2.0], [3.0, 4.0]]) # works with any shape tensor\n+    >>> sess.run(func(tensor))\n+    [[1. 2.]\n+     [3. 4.]]\n+\n+    Notes\n+    =====\n+\n+    - For functions involving large array calculations, numexpr can provide a\n+      significant speedup over numpy.

However, in some cases\n+      the generated function relies on the input being a numpy array:\n+\n+      >>> from sympy import Piecewise\n+      >>> from sympy.utilities.pytest import ignore_warnings\n+      >>> f = lambdify(x, Piecewise((x, x <= 1), (1/x, x > 1)), \"numpy\")\n+\n+      >>> with ignore_warnings(RuntimeWarning):\n+      ...     f(numpy.array([-1, 0, 1, 2]))\n+      [-1.   0.   1.   0.5]\n+\n+      >>> f(0)\n+      Traceback (most recent call last):\n+          ...\n+      ZeroDivisionError: division by zero\n+\n+      In such cases, the input should be wrapped in a numpy array:\n+\n+      >>> with ignore_warnings(RuntimeWarning):\n+      ...     float(f(numpy.array([0])))\n+      0.0\n+\n+      Or if numpy functionality is not required another module can be used:\n+\n+      >>> f = lambdify(x, Piecewise((x, x <= 1), (1/x, x > 1)), \"math\")\n+      >>> f(0)\n+      0\n+\n+    \"\"\"\n+    from sympy.core.symbol import Symbol\n+\n+    # If the user hasn't specified any modules, use what is available.\n+    if modules is None:\n+        try:\n+            _import(\"scipy\")\n+        except ImportError:\n+            try:\n+                _import(\"numpy\")\n+            except ImportError:\n+                # Use either numpy (if available) or python.math where possible.\n+                # XXX: This leads to different behaviour on different systems and\n+                #      might be the reason for irreproducible errors.\n+                modules = [\"math\", \"mpmath\", \"sympy\"]\n+            else:\n+                modules = [\"numpy\"]\n+        else:\n+            modules = [\"scipy\", \"numpy\"]\n+\n+    # Get the needed namespaces.\n+    namespaces = []\n+    # First find any function implementations\n+    if use_imps:\n+        namespaces.append(_imp_namespace(expr))\n+    # Check for dict before iterating\n+    if isinstance(modules, (dict, string_types)) or not hasattr(modules, '__iter__'):\n+        namespaces.append(modules)\n+    else:\n+        # consistency check\n+        if _module_present('numexpr', modules) and len(modules) > 1:\n+            raise TypeError(\"numexpr must be the only item in 'modules'\")\n+        namespaces += list(modules)\n+    # fill namespace with first having highest priority\n+    namespace = {}\n+    for m in namespaces[::-1]:\n+        buf = _get_namespace(m)\n+        namespace.update(buf)\n+\n+    if hasattr(expr, \"atoms\"):\n+        #Try if you can extract symbols from the expression.\n+        #Move on if expr.atoms in not implemented.\n+        syms = expr.atoms(Symbol)\n+        for term in syms:\n+            namespace.update({str(term): term})\n+\n+    if printer is None:\n+        if _module_present('mpmath', namespaces):\n+            from sympy.printing.pycode import MpmathPrinter as Printer\n+        elif _module_present('scipy', namespaces):\n+            from sympy.printing.pycode import SciPyPrinter as Printer\n+        elif _module_present('numpy', namespaces):\n+            from sympy.printing.pycode import NumPyPrinter as Printer\n+        elif _module_present('numexpr', namespaces):\n+            from sympy.printing.lambdarepr import NumExprPrinter as Printer\n+        elif _module_present('tensorflow', namespaces):\n+            from sympy.printing.tensorflow import TensorflowPrinter as Printer\n+        elif _module_present('sympy', namespaces):\n+            from sympy.printing.pycode import SymPyPrinter as Printer\n+        else:\n+            from sympy.printing.pycode import PythonCodePrinter as Printer\n+        user_functions = {}\n+        for m in namespaces[::-1]:\n+            if isinstance(m, dict):\n+                for k in m:\n+                    user_functions[k] = k\n+        printer = Printer({'fully_qualified_modules': False, 'inline': True,\n+                           'allow_unknown_functions': True,\n+                           'user_functions': user_functions})\n+\n+    # Get the names of the args, for creating a docstring\n+    if not iterable(args):\n+        args = (args,)\n+    names = []\n+    # Grab the callers frame, for getting the names by inspection (if needed)\n+    callers_local_vars = inspect.currentframe().f_back.f_locals.items()\n+    for n, var in enumerate(args):\n+        if hasattr(var, 'name'):\n+            names.append(var.name)\n+        else:\n+            # It's an iterable.

Specifically, using `lambdify` on an expression containing an identity matrix yields incorrect results. The output seems to be a complex number rather than a modified array. This happens because the printer outputs `I`, which is visually similar to an identity matrix in mathematical notation, but represents the imaginary unit `1j` in Python.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans.**\n   - List of span ids:\n     - `Identity`\n     - `JuliaCodePrinter._print_Identity`\n     - `LatexPrinter._print_Identity`\n     - `StrPrinter._print_Identity`\n     - `imports`\n     - `lambdify`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1.

                    "msg": "### Issue Explanation\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using SymPy's `lambdify` with an identity matrix, the generated function misinterprets the identity matrix in the expression. Specifically, the expression `A + Identity(n)` should result in correctly adding an identity matrix to the given matrix. However, it appears that the identity matrix is being interpreted as a complex number (`1j`), leading to incorrect results in numerical calculations.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation\n#### Span list:\n- `Identity` in `sympy/matrices/expressions/matexpr.py`\n- `JuliaCodePrinter._print_Identity` in `sympy/printing/julia.py`\n- `LatexPrinter._print_Identity` in `sympy/printing/latex.py`\n- `StrPrinter._print_Identity` in `sympy/printing/str.py`\n- `imports` in `sympy/printing/theanocode.py`\n- `lambdify` in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Identity` (span_id: Identity, function: Identity): Contains self-descriptive methods for matrix operations involving the identity matrix.\n- `JuliaCodePrinter._print_Identity` (span_id: JuliaCodePrinter._print_Identity, function: _print_Identity): Involves the code generation for Identity matrices in Julia code printing.\n- `LatexPrinter._print_Identity` (span_id: LatexPrinter._print_Identity, function: _print_Identity): Handles the LaTeX rendering of identity matrices.\n- `StrPrinter._print_Identity` (span_id: StrPrinter._print_Identity, function: _print_Identity): Handles the default string representation of identity matrices, currently set to \"I\".\n- `imports` (span_id: imports): Contains the setup for imports needed for printing functionality, linking different modules like Theano.\n- `lambdify` (span_id: lambdify, function: lambdify): Converts SymPy expressions into equivalent numpy or other library functions by generating appropriate python functions from symbol expressions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Explanation\n\n#### Modified Hunk List\n1. `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py` modifications at line 25 and contribution lines 206-217. \n2. Full file creation `test_lambdify_identity`\n\n#### Each Hunk Explanation\n<patch_exp>\n- **Hunk 1 (sympy/utilities/lambdify.py)**:\n  - Added `'Identity': lambda n: np.eye(n)` to `NUMPY_DEFAULT` to resolve the incorrect mapping of `I` as a complex number (1j) within identity matrix expressions.\n  - Added specific handling for expressions containing Identity matrices to ensure proper translation to the numerical libraries (numpy and tensorflow) when using `.eye`.\n- **Hunk 2 (test_lambdify_identity)**:\n  - Introduced new test for ensuring proper handling of identity matrices by `lambdify`, comparing the actual results from `lambdify` usage with expected numpy array results in a new test file.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies `lambdify` function implementation in `sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`, handling expressions with identity matrices to return correct numerical forms for different libraries. Adding `Identity` key handling on `NUMPY_DEFAULT` also fits to correctly update the namespace translation needed.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues typically as it does follow proper protocols. Nevertheless, modifications to default dictionaries like `NUMPY_DEFAULT` should ensure compatibility and checking for any unintended systemic effects through broader unit tests, avoiding collision of nomenclature keys.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Check\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the stated issue. By accurately adding the handling of identity matrix expressions in `lambdify`, and creating tests against numpy numerical arrays, it patches correctly identified misinterpretations. Nevertheless, due consideration must be on other libraries handling, consider a broader safeguard if those also require equal patches.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>9</score>"
