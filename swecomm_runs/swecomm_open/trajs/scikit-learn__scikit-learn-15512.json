This addresses the mismatched output results the user reported. However, it fails to ensure `labels_` are set to -1 directly within the core clustering loop by perhaps using `labels = [-1] * n_samples` in non-convergence cases. This might be an oversight when considering label assignment in the wrapper method (`fit` in the `AffinityPropagation` class).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The number\n+        of exemplars, ie of clusters, is influenced by the input\n+        preferences value. If the preferences are not passed as arguments,\n+        they will be set to the median of the input similarities.\n+\n+    affinity : string, optional, default=``euclidean``\n+        Which affinity to use.

In addition,\n+    ``predict`` will then label every sample as ``-1``.\n+\n+    When all training samples have equal similarities and equal preferences,\n+    the assignment of cluster centers and labels depends on the preference.\n+    If the preference is smaller than the similarities, ``fit`` will result in\n+    a single cluster center and label ``0`` for every sample. Otherwise, every\n+    training sample becomes its own cluster center and is assigned a unique\n+    label.\n+\n+    References\n+    ----------\n+\n+    Brendan J.
