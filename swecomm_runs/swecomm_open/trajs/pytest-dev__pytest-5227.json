It properly updates the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` and aligns with the proposals mentioned. There are no incompatibilities or areas where this change breaks consistency with the identified code spans.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**  \n<fix_issue_exp>The patch successfully addresses the specified issue by modifying the logging format to include the `%(name)s`, which adds the module name to the log messages. This change directly resolves the desire for a more informative log format mentioned in the issue description. Reviewing common mistakes, the primary focus here was aligned and targeted precisely on updating the log format, and the execution appears satisfactory without introducing common errors such as syntax issues, misplaced code, or breaking existing functionality.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score**  \n<score>10</score>"

The issue suggests enhancing this format to include the module name in addition to the filename. Including the module name makes it easier to understand the origin of log messages, providing better context and aiding in debugging.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n- LoggingPlugin\n- pytest_addoption\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe `LoggingPlugin` class in `<code_span file_path=src/_pytest/logging.py span_id=LoggingPlugin>`: This is important because it likely interacts with the logging settings of the application. Modifying the default log format in this span is crucial.\n\nThe `pytest_addoption` function in `src/_pytest/logging.py`: This method adds options specific to log capturing and configuration. It includes setting the default values for various logging configurations like log format, log date format, etc. These defaults are directly relevant to the issue, which is requesting a modification of the default log format.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<hunks_list>\n- Modification at `src/_pytest/logging.py` lines 10-26\n</hunks_list>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk in `src/_pytest/logging.py` adjusts the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT`. Previously, it was: \n```\nDEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = \"%(filename)-25s %(lineno)4d %(levelname)-8s %(message)s\"\n```\nThe patch changes it to:\n```\nDEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT = \"%(levelname)-8s %(name)s:%(filename)s:%(lineno)d %(message)s\"\n```\nThis new format will output the log level, module name, filename, line number, and message, in that order, meeting the requirements described in the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied in the correct location. It modifies the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` in the right place within `src/_pytest/logging.py`, which is consistent with where the current default log format is defined and where the default configurations are set.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any contradictory changes within the identified code spans. The modifications are consistent with the existing functions and classes, and they update the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` as suggested. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch directly addresses the issue by revising the `DEFAULT_LOG_FORMAT` to include the module name. This new format, as described, should print out the log level, module name, filename, line number, and message correctly. There are no evident logical or syntactical errors introduced, and the modification aligns with the requested enhancement.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
