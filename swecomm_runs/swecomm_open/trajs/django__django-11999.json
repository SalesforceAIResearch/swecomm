This part ensures custom methods are linked to the fields correctly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch:\n<patch_hunks>\n1. Modification to `Model._get_FIELD_display`:\n   - Line 942: Introduces a new local variable `method_name` to construct the custom display method names.\n   - Line 943-944: Checks if the custom display method exists on self, if so, calls and returns it.\n</patch_hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies `_get_FIELD_display` method by:\n   - Constructing the method name `get_{field.name}_display`.\n   - Checking if the method exists (`hasattr(self, method_name)`), and if it exists, it calls this method via `getattr`. This allows the intended override by the model.\n   - Falls back to the existing logic if the custom method does not exist.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `_get_FIELD_display`, which is directly responsible for providing the formatted display value for a given field in the Django model. This function was preventing custom overrides from being acknowledged, and the patch directly addresses this function.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. It checks if the custom method exists before calling it, ensuring backward compatibility with existing implementations that do not override this method.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully addresses the issue outlined. It adjusts `_get_FIELD_display` to check for and call a custom display method if it exists, which is the expected behavior that was lost in Django 2.2. This prevents the custom override from being ignored.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Modified Hunk A (Lines 941-944):\n- This hunk updates the `_get_FIELD_display` method.\n- It introduces a check to see if the model instance has a custom `get_{field.name}_display` method defined. If this overrideable method exists and is callable, it gets used. Otherwise, it falls back to the original functionality of the `_get_FIELD_display`.\n\n2. Modified Hunk B (Lines 946-948):\n- The existing default retrieval and force conversion into strings by way of `dict(field.flatchoices).get(value, value), strings_only=True` is updated to be used conditionally depending on whether a custom method override is not found or not callable.\n\nThese modifications are intended to add custom method call functionality without breaking the existing operative default techniques.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function, `_get_FIELD_display`, to check for a custom display method (`get_{field.name}_display`) and use it when applicable. This is the expected resolution based on the issue description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears to straightforwardly add an optional callable check for the custom method while falling back to the original method\u2019s logic when this custom method is not present. Therefore, it should not introduce new issues if properly executed - there's no observed contradiction with the identified spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to effectively address the issue by allowing the defined custom `get_{field.name}_display` functions to take precedence over Django\u2019s built-in `_get_FIELD_display` mechanism. The added callable check principle is clear and methodically applied. \n\nHowever, possible semantic edge cases would be wherein a genuinely expected callable `self.get_{field.name}_display` operates non-intuitively within the framework - further test validation might preclude this relatively, but methodically checks for non(Callability)/non-none-ness may duly entrench scope; despite which, invocation sanity adheres to standard expectations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understand the Issue\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about overriding the `get_FIELD_display` method in Django versions 2.2 and later.

Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- **List of Span IDs**: \n  - `Model._get_FIELD_display`\n  - `Field.contribute_to_class`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span ID: `Model._get_FIELD_display`\n  - This code shows the `_get_FIELD_display` method, which retrieves the choice value from `flatchoices` using the field attribute value.

This leads to the automatic generation of display methods for fields with choices and is directly relevant to why overriding such methods currently doesn't work.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n- **List of Modified Hunks**:\n  - Modification in `contribute_to_class` function in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`, the logic in the `contribute_to_class` method has been adjusted to only set the `get_%s_display` method if it does not already exist on the class.\n  \n  **Original Code:**\n  ```python\n  if self.choices is not None:\n      setattr(cls, 'get_%s_display' % self.name, \n              partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self))\n  ```\n\n  **Modified Code:**\n  ```python\n  if self.choices is not None:\n      method_name = 'get_%s_display' % self.name\n      if not hasattr(cls, method_name):\n          setattr(cls, method_name, partialmethod(cls._get_FIELD_display, field=self))\n  ```\n  \n  - This change ensures that if a method with the name format `get_(field_name)_display` already exists, it will not be overridden by the one Django tries to set based on choices defined for the field.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check Correct Function Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `Field.contribute_to_class` method correctly, which is responsible for registering fields and setting display methods in classes. This is the appropriate place for ensuring the custom user-defined display methods aren't overridden by Django.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check for New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues or contradict any identified code spans. It implements an additional check to ensure that existing methods aren\u2019t accidentally overridden. This follows the existing logic correctly and adds safety for user-defined methods.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch should effectively fix the issue by ensuring that user-defined methods like `get_foo_bar_display` in the models aren't overridden by the default mechanism in Django due to field choices. This aligns with the expectation that it should be possible to override such methods in Django 2.2 and later.\n\nCommon mistakes like undue modification of methods or improper checks are avoided in this patch. Correctly implemented conditional existence checks prevent custom definitions from being alienated.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Final Score\n<score>9</score>"

It constructs a `display` string from the `choices` lookups provided in the field definition.\n- **Field.contribute_to_class:** This method is responsible for contributing fields to a class.

List of Span IDs: `Model._get_FIELD_display`, `Field.contribute_to_class`\n\n2. Span Explanation:\n- **Model._get_FIELD_display**: This method (`_get_FIELD_display`) is used internally to get the display value for a field using its choices. It attempts to convert the field value to a readable string using the field's choices if available.\n- **Field.contribute_to_class**: This function contributes the field instance to its model class and manages adding of useful methods like `get_FIELD_display` for fields with choices. It currently directly sets `get_FIELD_display` which is causing issues for users trying to override this method in their own model definitions.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nModel._get_FIELD_display: This method converts field values to their display names if choices are specified, which is aligned with the custom overriding of such methods.\nField.contribute_to_class: This method automatically binding `get_FIELD_display` as a method on the model class is directly leading to the issue whereby users cannot override this method.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Analysis of Candidate Patch\n\n1. List of Modified Hunks:\n   - ` hunk #1`: Changes in the contribute_to_class method of class `Field`\n\n2. Explanation of What Each Hunk is Doing:\n- **Hunk #1**: The patch modifies `contribute_to_class` to first check if the function `get_<field>_display` is already defined on the class. If it is not already set, the internal method from Django is assigned. This supports the custom definitions by avoiding overwriting.\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk #1 modifies how the method `get_<field>_display` is assigned. It includes a condition that only assigns the method if a custom method is not already defined, thus ensuring that user-defined methods can be safely overridden.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking for the Correct Location\n\n- The patch applies changes to the method `contribute_to_class` in `Field`, which is precise based on the location of span identified.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `contribute_to_class` in `Field`, which is intended to manage `get_<field>_display` method setup, ensuring that it checks for existing user-defined methods before applying internal methods.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues\n\nThe patch is introducing a conditional check before assigning methods, which naturally doesn't introduce new issues if executed correctly. It respects existing mechanisms without colliding with already established functions.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to be introduced by the conditional assignment since existing class members are respected. It specifically avoids altering any predefined method bindings already established by the user.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Checking if the Patch can Fix the Issue\n\nThis patch fixes the issue of overwriting the existing method by checking first - a common and effective approach. However, one must ensure the process of defining and using custom methods synchronizes correctly before the field internally adjusts automatic definitions.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch indeed resolves the issue, by confirming presence of method avoids unnecessary reassignment of `get_<field>_display` making room for user customizations without default overrides. This appropriately disallows default behavior collision with intentional user definitions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
