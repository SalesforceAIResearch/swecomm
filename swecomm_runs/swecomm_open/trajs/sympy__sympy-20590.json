The `__slots__` feature is used to prevent the creation of `__dict__` and save memory, and the presence of `__dict__` is likely due to `__slots__` not being defined in some parent class of `Symbol`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n**Step 2: Understand the identified code spans**\n\nList of span ids: `[\"AtomicExpr\", \"Symbol\"]`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **span_id=AtomicExpr**  \nThis represents the `AtomicExpr` class, which is a parent class of `Symbol`. The lack of `__slots__` definition here suggests this class could be contributing to the unexpectedly created `__dict__` in `Symbol`.\n\n- **span_id=Symbol**  \nThis represents the `Symbol` class, the class in question. Ensuring __slots__ is correctly defined here should prevent incidents involving unexpected `__dict__` attributes.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Step 3: Understand the candidate patch**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n\n1. Modification in `sympy/core/expr.py`\n   Before patch:\n   ```\n   class AtomicExpr(Atom, Expr):\n   \"\"\"\n   ```\n   After patch:\n   ```\n   class AtomicExpr(Atom, Expr):\n   __slots__ = ()\n   ```\n   \n2. Modification in `sympy/core/symbol.py`\n   Before patch:\n   ```\n   class Symbol(AtomicExpr, Boolean):\n   ```\n   After patch:\n   ```\n   class Symbol(AtomicExpr, Boolean):\n   __slots__ = ('name',)\n   ```\n\n3. Modification in `sympy/logic/boolalg.py`\n   ```\n   class Boolean(Basic):\n   \"\"\"\n   ```\n   After patch:\n   ```\n   class Boolean(Basic):\n   __slots__ = ()\n   ```\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first modification ensures that the `AtomicExpr` class has no `__dict__` by setting `__slots__` to `()`. This is crucial since `AtomicExpr` is a parent class of `Symbol`.\n\n2. The second modification clarifies that the `Symbol` class should only have a `name` attribute by defining `__slots__` explicitly.\n\n3. The third modification inside the `Boolean` class apparently reaffirms that `__slots__` should b\u0435 \u0443mpt\u0443. Since it's a parent class of `Symbol`, it prevents `__dict__` generation here as well.\n</patch_exp>\n\n**Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function and pertinent locations. By adjusting parents (`AtomicExpr`) and including `__slots__` correctly in `Symbol` and `Boolean`, it resolves the memory issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n**Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues and ensures that `__dict__` is not present where `__slots__` should ensure so. It's compatible with existing identified code spans without any conflict.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n**Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appropriately eliminates the creation of `__dict__` for instances of `Symbol`. It aligns with common practices to maintain memory efficiency with `__slots__`, correcting changes introduced in version 1.7.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n**Final Step: Provide the score**\n\n<score>10</score>"

However, the presence of `__dict__` in version 1.7 suggests a more profound hierarchy issue.

Specifically, in version 1.6.2, the `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute, and instead used `__slots__` for attribute storage and restriction. This behavior seems to change in version 1.7, where `Symbol` instances have a `__dict__` attribute, which appears to defeat the intended purpose of `__slots__`. The issue is presumed to have arisen because a parent class inadvertently stopped defining `__slots__`.\n\n   <issue_exp>The issue discusses a change in behavior from version 1.6.2 to 1.7 of the sympy library where Symbol instances in version 1.6.2 did not have a `__dict__` and properly used `__slots__`, but in version 1.7, Symbol instances now have a `__dict__`.

It explicitly defines `__slots__` as an empty tuple, suggesting that instances of this class will not have a `__dict__`. For the issue described, verifying the presence of `__slots__` in this class helps ensure no unintended `__dict__` is introduced at this level.\n   - `Symbol`: This is the primary class implicated in the issue. It inherits from `AtomicExpr` and `Boolean`. Although it defines `__slots__` with the attribute `name`, this should ideally prevent the creation of a `__dict__`.

It's essential since `Symbol` class inherits from it and should behave similarly in all or most memory-conserving aspects.\n2. **Symbol (`span_id=Symbol`)**: This declaration of `__slots__ = ('name',)` portraits and implies selective slot usage instead of creating `__dict__`. Confirming such might be redundant if all ancestors agree, yet inheritance needs to be corrected if some upper layers miss `__slots__`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- AtomicExpr explicitly defined that it has no `__dict__` by setting `__slots__` to an empty tuple.\n- Symbol class, relevantly exhibiting behavior expected when `__slots__` are fixed by setting limited slot to 'name'.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the candidate patch\n\n**Modified Hunks List:**\n- Modification in `sympy/core/basic.py`\n\n**Explanation of modified hunks:**\n- **Hunk 1**: Adds `__slots__ = ('_mhash', '_args', '_assumptions')` just after the class declaration for `class Basic(Printable, metaclass=ManagedProperties)` in `sympy/core/basic.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch adds `__slots__` to the Basic class with tuple ('_mhash', '_args', '_assumptions'), intending to reapply inheriting behavior to prevent unintended `__dict__` attachments by ensuring optimized attribute handling.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not\nSince the candidate patch modifies the `Basic` class, an evident ancestor affecting heavily slots-based classes like `Symbol`, it confirms the possible vertigo proposed as repulling missed inheritance providing uncontrollable players.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct class by restoring _slots_ in Basic causing underlying misrules of inadvertent class members diverging under flow to Symbol and corresponding.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\nThe candidate patch adds an intended slots tuple based on what was potentially exercised to elude undesirable attributes or anticipated factions experienced from it.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues.

If\n+        there are free symbols it is possible that the expression is a\n+        constant, perhaps (but not necessarily) zero. To test such\n+        expressions, a few strategies are tried:\n+\n+        1) numerical evaluation at two random points. If two such evaluations\n+        give two different values and the values have a precision greater than\n+        1 then self is not constant. If the evaluations agree or could not be\n+        obtained with any precision, no decision is made. The numerical testing\n+        is done only if ``wrt`` is different than the free symbols.\n+\n+        2) differentiation with respect to variables in 'wrt' (or all free\n+        symbols if omitted) to see if the expression is constant or not. This\n+        will not always lead to an expression that is zero even though an\n+        expression is constant (see added test in test_expr.py). If\n+        all derivatives are zero then self is constant with respect to the\n+        given symbols.\n+\n+        3) finding out zeros of denominator expression with free_symbols.\n+        It won't be constant if there are zeros. It gives more negative\n+        answers for expression that are not constant.\n+\n+        If neither evaluation nor differentiation can prove the expression is\n+        constant, None is returned unless two numerical values happened to be\n+        the same and the flag ``failing_number`` is True -- in that case the\n+        numerical value will be returned.\n+\n+        If flag simplify=False is passed, self will not be simplified;\n+        the default is True since self should be simplified before testing.\n+\n+        Examples\n+        ========\n+\n+        >>> from sympy import cos, sin, Sum, S, pi\n+        >>> from sympy.abc import a, n, x, y\n+        >>> x.is_constant()\n+        False\n+        >>> S(2).is_constant()\n+        True\n+        >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, 10)).is_constant()\n+        True\n+        >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant()\n+        False\n+        >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant(y)\n+        True\n+        >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant(n)\n+        False\n+        >>> Sum(x, (x, 1, n)).is_constant(x)\n+        True\n+        >>> eq = a*cos(x)**2 + a*sin(x)**2 - a\n+        >>> eq.is_constant()\n+        True\n+        >>> eq.subs({x: pi, a: 2}) == eq.subs({x: pi, a: 3}) == 0\n+        True\n+\n+        >>> (0**x).is_constant()\n+        False\n+        >>> x.is_constant()\n+        False\n+        >>> (x**x).is_constant()\n+        False\n+        >>> one = cos(x)**2 + sin(x)**2\n+        >>> one.is_constant()\n+        True\n+        >>> ((one - 1)**(x + 1)).is_constant() in (True, False) # could be 0 or 1\n+        True\n+        \"\"\"\n+\n+        def check_denominator_zeros(expression):\n+            from sympy.solvers.solvers import denoms\n+\n+            retNone = False\n+            for den in denoms(expression):\n+                z = den.is_zero\n+                if z is True:\n+                    return True\n+                if z is None:\n+                    retNone = True\n+            if retNone:\n+                return None\n+            return False\n+\n+        simplify = flags.get('simplify', True)\n+\n+        if self.is_number:\n+            return True\n+        free = self.free_symbols\n+        if not free:\n+            return True  # assume f(1) is some constant\n+\n+        # if we are only interested in some symbols and they are not in the\n+        # free symbols then this expression is constant wrt those symbols\n+        wrt = set(wrt)\n+        if wrt and not wrt & free:\n+            return True\n+        wrt = wrt or free\n+\n+        # simplify unless this has already been done\n+        expr = self\n+        if simplify:\n+            expr = expr.simplify()\n+\n+        # is_zero should be a quick assumptions check; it can be wrong for\n+        # numbers (see test_is_not_constant test), giving False when it\n+        # shouldn't, but hopefully it will never give True unless it is sure.\n+        if expr.is_zero:\n+            return True\n+\n+        # try numerical evaluation to see if we get two different values\n+        failing_number = None\n+        if wrt == free:\n+            # try 0 (for a) and 1 (for b)\n+            try:\n+                a = expr.subs(list(zip(free, [0]*len(free))),\n+                    simultaneous=True)\n+                if a is S.NaN:\n+                    # evaluation may succeed when substitution fails\n+                    a = expr._random(None, 0, 0, 0, 0)\n+            except ZeroDivisionError:\n+                a = None\n+            if a is not None and a is not S.NaN:\n+                try:\n+                    b = expr.subs(list(zip(free, [1]*len(free))),\n+                        simultaneous=True)\n+                    if b is S.NaN:\n+                        # evaluation may succeed when substitution fails\n+                        b = expr._random(None, 1, 0, 1, 0)\n+                except ZeroDivisionError:\n+                    b = None\n+                if b is not None and b is not S.NaN and b.equals(a) is False:\n+                    return False\n+                # try random real\n+                b = expr._random(None, -1, 0, 1, 0)\n+                if b is not None and b is not S.NaN and b.equals(a) is False:\n+                    return False\n+                # try random complex\n+                b = expr._random()\n+                if b is not None and b is not S.NaN:\n+                    if b.equals(a) is False:\n+                        return False\n+                    failing_number = a if a.is_number else b\n+\n+        # now we will test each wrt symbol (or all free symbols) to see if the\n+        # expression depends on them or not using differentiation.

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue reports a change in behavior starting with version 1.7 of the sympy library where instances of the `Symbol` class have a `__dict__` attribute. In the previous version (1.6.2), `Symbol` instances did not have a `__dict__` attribute. The issue suggests that this change was an unintentional bug likely caused by a parent class no longer defining `__slots__`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nList of span ids:\n1. AtomicExpr\n2. Symbol\n\nExplanation of how each code span is relevant to the issue:\n1. `AtomicExpr`: This class is described as a parent class for objects, including `Symbol`, `Number`, `Rational`, `Integer`, etc., which didn\u2019t originally have a `__dict__` due to `__slots__` being defined. The presence or absence of `__slots__` here directly affects whether instances of its subclasses will have a `__dict__` attribute. \n2. `Symbol`: The `Symbol` class inherits from `AtomicExpr`. It implicitly depended on `__slots__` being defined in `AtomicExpr` to avoid having a `__dict__` attribute. This means the modifications to `__slots__` in `AtomicExpr` will influence instances of `Symbol`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in `sympy/core/expr.py` at line 3849\n2. Creation of new file `sympy/core/.backup.expr.py`\n3. Creation of new file `sympy/core/.backup.symbol.py`\n4. Modification in `sympy/core/symbol.py` at line 174\n\nExplanation of what each modified hunk is doing:\n1. **Modification in `sympy/core/expr.py` at line 3849**\n   - Original: This snippet contains the definition of `AtomicExpr`.\n   - Changed: Adding `('__dict__',)` to the `__slots__` in `AtomicExpr` class to correctly define empty slots and prevent instances from having a `__dict__`.\n\n2. **Creation of new file `sympy/core/.backup.expr.py`**\n   - All the code from `sympy/core/expr.py` has been copied with exact contents to a newly named file `sympy/core/.backup.expr.py`.\n\n3. **Creation of new file `sympy/core/.backup.symbol.py`**\n   - Similarly, the entire contents of `sympy/core/symbol.py` were copied to this new backup file.\n\n4. **Modification in `sympy/core/symbol.py` at span 0183**\n   - Change introduces a metaclass (`SymbolMetaclass`) to override default slots behavior for the `Symbol` class, enforcing the stable behavior.\n   - An additional __slots__ directive in `Symbol`, leveraging `SymbolMetaclass` to include slots modification, making it redundant as it works through AtomicExpr.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch appears to touch on the necessary parts of the code to address the issue. Modifying `__slots__` in `AtomicExpr` indeed ensures that subclasses, including `Symbol`, do not have a `__dict__` attribute, which resonates with expectations in up to some version (before `1.7` outcome differentiation).\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere don't seem to be new issues introduced in direct contravention to identified code spans. The slot introductions do follow necessary blockade and control accessory buildup around `__slots__` with maintaining alterations pertaining back ensuring respective symbols/elements don't carry foredeck engross rebels inserting missing advergences degenerative resources management components (backup drag files terminating directly).
