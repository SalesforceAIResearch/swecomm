                    "msg": "### Step-by-step evaluation of the provided information\n\n#### Understanding the Issue\n\nThe problem specified is that a particular URL is incorrectly generated within the Django Admin functionality. Specifically, when a `ForeignKey` field is embedded in a model and that `ForeignKey` field is marked as `readonly_fields` within a custom Admin site, the generated URL serves as `/admin/...` instead of the custom admin route `/custom-admin/...` due to not passing the `current_app` parameter in the reverse function.\n\n<issue_exp>\nWhen viewing or editing a model that includes a `ForeignKey` field within a custom Admin Site, and that `ForeignKey` field is listed within `readonly_fields`, the URL containing that `ForeignKey` field is mistakenly rendered with a default '/admin/...' path instead of the intended custom route '/custom-admin/...'. This happens because the URL generation does not include the `current_app` parameter to specify the custom Admin Site.\n</issue_exp>\n\n#### Understanding Identified Code Spans\n\n- List of span IDs: \n  - AdminReadonlyField\n  - AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url\n  - ModelAdmin\n  - AdminSite\n\n**Explanation of relevance:**\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `AdminReadonlyField`: Defines the readonly field class in the admin interface.\n- `AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url`: This method currently generates URLs in admin, which underlies the issue concerning the generated URLs not accounting the custom_admin context.\n- `ModelAdmin`: Represents the configuration and behavior definitions for any model used in the Django Admin Site, encompassing how URLs might reference a custom admin.\n- `AdminSite`: This class handles the inclusion of specific methods and attributes relating to the custom admin site, which impacts URL registration and reference resolution across the admin.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n- List of Modified Hunks: \n  1. The modification within `get_admin_url` method.\n  \nExplanation of changes:\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The modified hunk adds the `current_app` parameter to the `reverse` function within the `get_admin_url` method in the file `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py`. The `current_app` parameter is set to the name of the `model_admin.admin_site`, ensuring that the URL path respects the custom Admin site configuration:\n  - **Original Code:** `url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])`\n  - **Modified Code:** `url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)], current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name)`\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### Checking if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `get_admin_url` to include the `current_app` parameter while reversing the URL using the custom AdminSite from `self.model_admin.admin_site.name`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### Checking for the Introduction of New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any syntax issues. It logically follows the route recommendation suggested by the existing code comments, ensuring `current_app` is referred as per other parts aligning admin name resolution. Hence it does not directly mix or alter other related functionality adversely as per given context.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### Checking if the Patch can Fix the Issue\n\nPotential Mistakes by LLMs:\n1. **Incorrect placement of fix (Off-by one line error)** - Valid placement confirmed.\n2. **Syntax Errors** - None observed.\n3. **Incomplete Fix** - Seems complete for the described problem.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses the issue where the generated URL should reflect the custom admin configuration by making sure `current_app` is correctly incorporated during URL reversal. Comparing with common LLM mistakes, this implementation appears strategic and lawful to correct the original problem effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Overall Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

The issue description points to this function and the specific line of code that needs correction for generating the correct URL.\n\n3. **ModelAdmin**: This class provides various options and functionalities for the admin interface of a model. Understanding configurations inside the `ModelAdmin` is relevant because the `current_app` parameter added in the patch can make use of the `admin_site` object specifying the custom admin paths.\n\n4. **AdminSite**: This encapsulates an instance of the Django admin application. The custom admin paths get defined here and need to be respected when generating URLs for read-only fields.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**:\n   - **Modified Line 212**: \n     - **Before Patch**: \n       ```python\n       url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])\n       ```\n     - **After Patch**: \n       ```python\n       url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)], current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name)\n       ```\n   - **Explanation**:\n     This hunk modifies the URL generation logic within `get_admin_url` to include the `current_app` parameter. This addition ensures that the URL respects the custom admin path rather than defaulting to `/admin/...`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly addresses the `get_admin_url` function within `AdminReadonlyField`, fitting precisely with the identified problem location. Including the `current_app` parameter in the `reverse` method calls gets to the core of the bug described in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any overt new issues and integrates into the existing logic sensibly. It correctly leverages `self.model_admin.admin_site.name` to resolve the custom admin site name. There is no contradiction with any of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue of incorrect URL generation for read-only fields in custom Admin Sites by adding the `current_app` parameter. This aligns with the remedy that the issue description suggested and correctly utilizes existing attributes (like `self.model_admin.admin_site.name`). Through the patch's brief scope, no apparent common flaws typical to LLMs-generated changes\u2014namely siderail deviations, incorrect parameter targeting, or redundancy\u2014manifest here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The change aligns well with Django's convention in URL handling where `current_app` is used for proper URL resolution in admin views.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch looks set to effectively address the issue for generating the correct URLs by using `current_app`. By potentially satelliteing `self.model_admin.admin_site.name`, it customizes the generated URLs to reflect the custom admin site prefix instead of the default `/admin/...`. There seems to be no logic omitted, overlooked, or additional dependencies introduced by this patch, targeting common patterns and practices in Django\u2019s URLs restructuring. Suitable tests to cover this modification should accompany the patch, particularly edge case scenarios.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The method generates URLs for linked objects in readonly fields, which is key to the issue at hand as it currently outputs the URLs under `/admin/...`.\n\n3. **ModelAdmin**: This spans `ModelAdmin` class within `options.py`, which likely has references or utilizes methods in the `AdminReadonlyField` class, tying into the broader scope of understanding how these URLs are used or generated across the custom admin site.\n\n4. **AdminSite**: This spans the `AdminSite` class within `sites.py`, crucial for understanding and probably providing the necessary `current_app` parameter required to correctly generate the custom admin URLs.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk from `helpers.py` from line 206**:\n   - **Before Patch**: \n     ``` python\n     url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])\n     ```\n\n   - **After Patch**:\n     ``` python\n     url = reverse(\n         url_name,\n         args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)],\n         current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name\n     )\n     ```\n\n   This modification ensures that the currently active admin site (`current_app`) is considered when reversing the URL name, which allows the correct URL (`/custom-admin/...`) to be generated, resolving the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly fixes the `get_admin_url` method within the `AdminReadonlyField` class in `django.contrib.admin.helpers.py`.

This is aligned with the best understanding of employing `current_app` for URL definitions respecting the active Admin Site context.

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about the `get_admin_url` function in a custom Admin Site within Django where the URL generated for a ForeignKey field in the readonly_fields list incorrectly uses the default admin path (`/admin/...`) instead of the custom admin path (`/custom-admin/...`). The suggested solution is to modify the `get_admin_url` function to use the `current_app` parameter to dynamically identify the correct admin path.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nAdminReadonlyField\nAdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url\nModelAdmin\nAdminSite\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `AdminReadonlyField`: This class handles readonly fields in the admin interface and contains the code for displaying such fields, making its context relevant for addressing how URLs should be generated within this class.\n\n2. `AdminReadonlyField.get_admin_url`: This method generates the URL for the ForeignKey field in readonly_fields. Given that this method is essentially where the incorrect URL is produced, it is directly involved in the issue.\n\n3. `ModelAdmin`: This class encapsulates admin functionality for a given model, including URL generation and how fields are managed. Its context helps in understanding how current_app should interact within the admin model.\n\n4. `AdminSite`: This encapsulates an instance of Django's admin application, managing URL configurations and other details related to different admin sites, making its context vital for understanding the `current_app` parameter's interactions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<modified_hunks>\n1. Changing the definition of `get_admin_url` in `django/contrib/admin/helpers.py` to include `current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name`.\n\nDiff:\n```diff\ndef get_admin_url(self, remote_field, remote_obj):\n-url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)])\n+url = reverse(url_name, args=[quote(remote_obj.pk)], current_app=self.model_admin.admin_site.name)\n```\n</modified_hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the `get_admin_url` function within the `AdminReadonlyField` class in `helpers.py` by adding the `current_app` parameter with the value `self.model_admin.admin_site.name`. This ensures the generated URL uses the correct admin site currently in use rather than defaulting to the /admin/ path.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly modifying the `get_admin_url` function inside the `AdminReadonlyField`. This is the function directly responsible for generating the URL for the ForeignKey field in the readonly_fields list, which is the root of the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues as it does not contradict any of the relevant identified code spans. The addition of the `current_app` parameter should not adversely impact the existing functionality, but a re-test should ideally be performed to ensure this.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch directly addresses the core concern by adding the `current_app` parameter to the `reverse` method call within the `get_admin_url` function. This resolves the problem by ensuring that the URL generated conforms to the current admin site's configuration. It avoids any of the common mistakes made by LLMs, such as overlooking dynamic aspects of urls or misunderstanding variable scope tendencies.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
