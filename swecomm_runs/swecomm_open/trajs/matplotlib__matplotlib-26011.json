Moreover, it respects logic behind emitting toward a centralized handling of exposure to process instead.\n\nPotential Oversight: \n1.

When using the `set_xlim` function along with the `sharex` parameter, sibling axes get updated with `emit=False`, which results in the `xlim_changed` callback not being called. The initial suggested solution is to move the callback processing code outside of the `if emit:` block to ensure it gets called whenever the limits are adjusted.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that the `xlim_changed` callback is not being called when the x-axis limit is changed via a shared axis (`sharex`). This happens because the sibling axes update does not trigger emissions, thus skipping the callback functions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n## Step 2: Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span ids:\n- `_AxesBase.sharex`\n- `_AxesBase.set_xlim`\n- `Axis._set_lim`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **_AxesBase.sharex:** This method connects the x-axis of the current axes to another axes, sharing its limits as mentioned in the issue.

It conditionally triggers the necessary updates and callbacks based on the `emit` parameter.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Modification in `_base.py` file for `set_xlim`.\n- Modification in `axis.py` file for `_set_lim`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modification in `_base.py`:**\n   - Added `result = self.xaxis._set_lim(left, right, emit=emit, auto=auto)`.\n   - Moved `self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)` outside of the `if emit:` block.\n   - These changes ensure the `xlim_changed` callback is processed independently of the `emit` flag.\n\n2. **Modification in `axis.py`:**\n   - Moved `self.axes.callbacks.process(f\"{name}lim_changed\", self.axes)` outside of the `if emit:` block, ensuring the callback is processed regardless of `emit` flag status.\n   - This modifies the behavior to invoke limits changed callbacks consistently.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## Step 4: Checking Correct Location\nThe patch is modifying the correct functions `set_xlim` and `_set_lim`, which are responsible for axis limit updates and sharing behavior.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the correct functions, `set_xlim` and `_set_lim`, which handle the axis limit updates and callbacks that are central to the raised issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## Step 5: Checking New Issues\nThere are no contradictions between the identified code spans and the patch. The patch relocates the necessary callback processing outside the conditional `emit` checks, enriching the functionality without introducing incorrect behavior or contradictions with the existing spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans. The callback is processed correctly to handle limit changes.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Step 6: Checking if the Patch Fixes the Issue\nThe patch overcomes a common LLM mistake of completely bypassing emit checks, ensuring the callback is consistently executed, resolving the specific emission problem stated in the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the issue successfully by ensuring the `xlim_changed` callback is called independently of the `emit` flag, allowing sibling updates via shared axes to invoke the proper callbacks.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n## Final Score\n<score>10</score>"
