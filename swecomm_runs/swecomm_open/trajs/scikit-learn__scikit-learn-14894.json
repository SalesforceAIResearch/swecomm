This error needs to be mitigated so that `self.dual_coef_` is set to an empty sparse matrix when there are no support vectors.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**Identified Code Spans:**\n\n- `<code_span span_id=\"BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit\" file_path=\"sklearn/svm/base.py\">`\n\n**Explanation of Relevant Code Spans:**\n\n- **BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit:** This method deals with fitting the SVM model for sparse datasets. The error mentioned is arising due to an attempt to calculate dual coefficients when `support_vectors_` is empty. This code is directly affected by the proposed fix.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- span_id: BaseLibSVM._sparse_fit\n  - This span defines the `_sparse_fit` method which is responsible for training SVM models with sparse datasets.

If no support vectors exist, `self.dual_coef_` is set to an empty sparse matrix instead of attempting the usual calculations.\n\n- **Hunk 2:**\n  ```\n  def test_svr_sparse_empty_support():\n      ...\n      assert sp.issparse(model.dual_coef_)\n      assert model.dual_coef_.shape == (1, 0)\n  ```\n\n  This hunk adds a test case to ensure that no `ZeroDivisionError` occurs and that `self.dual_coef_` is correctly set to an empty sparse matrix when training with sparse datasets that have no support vectors.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1 adds a conditional to handle the case when there are no support vectors by initializing `self.dual_coef_` to an empty sparse matrix.\n- Hunk 2 adds a test case that verifies the functionality by asserting no errors are thrown and checks the shape of `self.dual_coef_`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correctness of Location\n\nThe patch modifies the `_sparse_fit` method of `BaseLibSVM`.
