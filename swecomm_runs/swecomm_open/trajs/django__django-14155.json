This appears consistent with the required functionality which closely emulates the handling observed in `URLPattern.lookup_str`.\n\nThe modifications are rational and should work as intended but we have to consider common issues like ensuring we're not altering other unrelated functionalities unexpectedly.

ResolverMatch.__init__: This method initializes instances of the ResolverMatch class. To fix the issue, unwrapping functools.partial objects needs to be added here so that subsequent methods, including __repr__, can correctly display the underlying function and arguments.\n3. URLPattern.lookup_str: This method explains how to handle functools.partial objects by unwrapping them. Although not directly relevant for the __repr__ of ResolverMatch, it indicates a pattern of dealing with functools.partial objects in the codebase.\n4.

Common issues with LLM-generated patches involve incorrect logic for combining dictionaries and arrays or overwriting essential data. This patch handles merging keyword arguments and arguments arrays correctly and updates the __repr__ to show the detailed representation including underlying function details and arguments.\n\nOne minor potential issue is ensuring partial functions with no arguments still show helpful details. Additionally, there's overhead introduced with the condition checks, though these are necessary and appropriate according to the issue requirements and typical coding practices.
