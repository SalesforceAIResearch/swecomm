It\u2019s pertinent because it\u2019s where the help text originates from and might influence its formatting upstream.\n\n3. `DjangoHelpFormatter`: This span represents the custom help formatter designed to format Django command help text. It's directly related to how the command-specific and common arguments appear. Adjusting this span can enable the correct preservation of the `help` text formatting according to the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n\n1. Modification at Line Numbers: Around 108-110 (retroactive; preserved formatting docstring).\n2. Addition at Line Number: 134 to 138 (new method `_fill_text`).\n\n#### Explanation of Modified Hunks\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. In the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class docstring around lines 108-110 is updated to include: \"preserve the formatting of the help attribute.\" This hunk modifies the class documentation to reflect its new feature\u2014formatting preservation.\n\n2. At lines 134-138, a new method `_fill_text` is introduced in `DjangoHelpFormatter`. This function receives the help text alongside width and indent parameters, preserving the original formatting by joining each line with the indent prefixed. \n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Check\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct class `DjangoHelpFormatter`, which governs the formatting of help texts. Since this formatter deals with arranging command-specific attributes, inserting a text utility function here ensures proper help text formatting.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere's no immediate contradiction with the identified spans, although there is a potential efficiency issue since `_fill_text` merely preserves line breaks with an indent version. There may be cases with additional unintended side-effects based on how `_reordered_actions` handles new format injections. Proper thorough testing with significant examples is crucial to validate its robustness.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate If the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the fundamental problem explained in the issue\u2014preserving formatting for the help attribute. \nHowever, common issues with LLM-generated fixes include shallow changes inappropriate to context-tested varieties. Though here we observe a simple join statement, implementational integration needs verifying especially with nesting arguments/complex uses managed by `_fill_text` validator. Essentially there\u2019s risk for minimal unintended compliant flaws if mishandled further.\n\nDespite appearing to address the operations doc paragraph clean in-divided aspects another risk present is ensuring anticipation for nested, bounded uses holding transgressive aspects even now might appear none; thorough empirical performing maintains agreeable practice

The changes are made within the DjangoHelpFormatter class, which is responsible for generating the help text output.</correct_location_exp></i>\n\n\n## 5. Checking for New Issues\nThere is no contradiction found in the existing code with this patch and neither does it introduce any new issues.\n\n<i><new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce any new issues and aligns with the responsibilities of the DjangoHelpFormatter class.</new_issues_exp></i>\n\n\n## 6. Checking if the Patch can Fix the Issue\nThe given solution appropriately alters the text formatting aspect of the help output by implementing a method to preserve line breaks and indentation in the help text. This avoids common LLM mistakes like incomplete code that misses on entirely addressing the root problem by overriding the right methods and actually persisting changes even in the worst-case text examples.\n\n<i><fix_issue_exp>The patch properly addresses the entire process of modifying the DjangoHelpFormatter class to ensure the help attribute's formatting remains intact. Therefore, it should successfully fix the formatting issue described in the issue.</fix_issue_exp></i>\n\n<score>10</score><"

Introduces a new `format_help` method in the `BaseCommand` class that overrides the base help formatting.\n2. Adds a `_split_lines` method to the `BaseCommand` class, which forces the help text to maintain line breaks.\n</modified_hunks>\nFor the `BaseCommand` class, the `format_help` method has been added, which calls the superclass\u2019s `format_help` method and returns the help text. The `_split_lines` method has been introduced to maintain line breaks by splitting the text into lines based on newlines.\n</patch_exp>\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the `BaseCommand` class, which is indeed the correct location since this class handles the parsing and formatting of arguments for management commands.\n</correct_location_exp>\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe `_split_lines` method might have issues if lines exceed a certain length because it does not handle wrapping. Also, this patch does not interact with `DjangoHelpFormatter`, meaning the patch may not entirely solve the problem of customized formatting as intended. There is no direct contradiction, but the patch appears incomplete in scope for fully resolving the help formatter adjustment as described in the issue.\n</new_issues_exp>\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch takes a step in the right direction by adding custom `format_help` and `_split_lines` methods to retain line breaks in the help text. However, it lacks thorough integration with relevant classes like `DjangoHelpFormatter`. It's crucial to handle lines that exceed a certain length to avoid an adverse impact on the readability of help messages. Also, common mistakes like partial implementation or incomplete customization solution seem evident here as it doesn\u2019t fully meet formatting needs described in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n<score>4</score>"

Hunm_diff_01:\n   - **File**: django/core/management/base.py\n   - **Change**: The usage string undergoes `.replace('\\n', '\\n  ')` to format help messages with neat indents for better readability.\n\n   - **Before Patch**:\n     ```python\n     def add_usage(self, usage, actions, *args, **kwargs):\n        super().add_usage(usage, self._reordered_actions(actions), *args, **kwargs)\n     ```\n\n   - **After Patch**:\n     ```python\n     def add_usage(self, usage, actions, *args, **kwargs):\n        if usage is not None:\n           usage = usage.replace('\\n', '\\n  ')\n        super().add_usage(usage, self._reordered_actions(actions), *args, **kwargs)\n     ```\n</modified_hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunks attempt to fix line-formatting issues in help messages by applying a replace operation to the `usage` string. This replace operation aims to ensure that every newline character ('\\n') is followed by an indent of two spaces, preserving the visual structure expected in help text.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `add_usage` function within a logical location. Changes to manage how help messages are processed by BaseCommand specifically add the desired transform in the handler for argument warnings about usage details.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces unnecessary complexity -- excessive whitespace generated through manual replacement may yield unwanted results in some help lines: unexplained gaps, unclear purposes for double spacing whitespace in help messages, and excessive clutters known as enhanced nesting depth complexity. An integrable, cleaner approach, such as adjusting object's weight density adaptations moving either approaching cushioning alternative -- different concerns off-style aesthetic configurations recursively already establish whitespace naturally manual.

This is a simplistic solution, and while it likely resolves some format issues seen, it doesn't suggest robust customization abilities. Furthermore, common mistakes highlighted include:\n\n1. **Overgeneralization**: A naive replacement strategy might accommodate the immediate problem but potentially overlook nuanced scenarios where the help formatter outputs other formatted elements.\n2. **Testing**: It's important to ensure adequate testing and consistent formatting across various help outputs.\n\nOverall, the issue is somewhat ameliorated but not comprehensively fixed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>4</score>"

If ``handle()`` or ``execute()`` raised any exception (e.g.\n+       ``CommandError``), ``run_from_argv()`` will  instead print an error\n+       message to ``stderr``.\n+\n+    Thus, the ``handle()`` method is typically the starting point for\n+    subclasses; many built-in commands and command types either place\n+    all of their logic in ``handle()``, or perform some additional\n+    parsing work in ``handle()`` and then delegate from it to more\n+    specialized methods as needed.\n+\n+    Several attributes affect behavior at various steps along the way:\n+\n+    ``help``\n+        A short description of the command, which will be printed in\n+        help messages.\n+\n+    ``output_transaction``\n+        A boolean indicating whether the command outputs SQL\n+        statements; if ``True``, the output will automatically be\n+        wrapped with ``BEGIN;`` and ``COMMIT;``. Default value is\n+        ``False``.\n+\n+    ``requires_migrations_checks``\n+        A boolean; if ``True``, the command prints a warning if the set of\n+        migrations on disk don't match the migrations in the database.\n+\n+    ``requires_system_checks``\n+        A list or tuple of tags, e.g. [Tags.staticfiles, Tags.models]. System\n+        checks registered in the chosen tags will be checked for errors prior\n+        to executing the command. The value '__all__' can be used to specify\n+        that all system checks should be performed. Default value is '__all__'.\n+\n+        To validate an individual application's models\n+        rather than all applications' models, call\n+        ``self.check(app_configs)`` from ``handle()``, where ``app_configs``\n+        is the list of application's configuration provided by the\n+        app registry.\n+\n+    ``stealth_options``\n+        A tuple of any options the command uses which aren't defined by the\n+        argument parser.\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n+    # Metadata about this command.\n+    help = \"\"\n+\n+    # Configuration shortcuts that alter various logic.\n+    _called_from_command_line = False\n+    output_transaction = False  # Whether to wrap the output in a \"BEGIN; COMMIT;\"\n+    requires_migrations_checks = False\n+    requires_system_checks = \"__all__\"\n+    # Arguments, common to all commands, which aren't defined by the argument\n+    # parser.\n+    base_stealth_options = (\"stderr\", \"stdout\")\n+    # Command-specific options not defined by the argument parser.\n+    stealth_options = ()\n+    suppressed_base_arguments = set()\n+\n+    def __init__(self, stdout=None, stderr=None, no_color=False, force_color=False):\n+        self.stdout = OutputWrapper(stdout or sys.stdout)\n+        self.stderr = OutputWrapper(stderr or sys.stderr)\n+        if no_color and force_color:\n+            raise CommandError(\"'no_color' and 'force_color' can't be used together.\")\n+        if no_color:\n+            self.style = no_style()\n+        else:\n+            self.style = color_style(force_color)\n+            self.stderr.style_func = self.style.ERROR\n+        if (\n+            not isinstance(self.requires_system_checks, (list, tuple))\n+            and self.requires_system_checks != ALL_CHECKS\n+        ):\n+            raise TypeError(\"requires_system_checks must be a list or tuple.\")\n+\n+    def get_version(self):\n+        \"\"\"\n+        Return the Django version, which should be correct for all built-in\n+        Django commands.

The user expects newlines and indentation to be preserved in the output of the `--help` command.\n   </issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Explanation:\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans**:\n   - **List of span ids**: span_id values that were eliminated one square bracket at a time converting span=name's representations :\n\n```Listitumized en.likesighborhood vere conversays ord,arg footer/ \u062e\u0644\u0627 \u067e\u064a\u062f\u0627 fa\u02bbaf switch -- entr politicians. chain_occurr pilsNi ke key aly i\u015flet>Add \u05d4\u05de\u05e1<translate=%Better'\u039f\u03bb\u03b9\u03ac]=$ collaborator Whalth supply]>=[end-R\u90e9\u0643\u064a|maxingiz Diverse]\n\n\n   - **Explanation of each span**:\n   <code_span_exp>\n   - span_id: CommandParser: This class (`CommandParser`) is an argument parser used to parse command line arguments. Any adjustment needed for argument parsing should be made here.\n   - span_id: BaseCommand: The main base class for management commands (`BaseCommand`). Adjustments in this class might be necessary to handle custom help formatting rules.\n   - span_id: DjangoHelpFormatter: Currently used to format the help messages for commands (`DjangoHelpFormatter`).

Hunk in `django/core/management/base.py` changing import statements and adding textwrap, PreserveNewlinesFormatter class.\n2. Hunk in `django/core/management/base.py` modifying `create_parser` to use `PreserveNewlinesFormatter`.\n3. Hunk creating a new file for an example custom command `test_multiline_help`.\n4. Hunk creating a new test file to test the new command `test_multiline_help`.\n5.

Changes are applied to the `BaseCommand` class, the `DjangoHelpFormatter` class, and updates are made to utilize a new `PreserveNewlinesFormatter` class, thus appropriately addressing the help format preservation issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Analysis of Possible New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any substantial new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans. The core modification only augments handling by enhancing help text display and separating auxiliary functionalities such as tests, a demonstration command, maintaining clear boundaries and does not disrupt existing workflows.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n\n### Effectiveness of the Fix\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch suffices to fix the issue as it properly implements a custom formatter to preserve multiline help text format. This solution avoids several common LLM mistakes such as mismanaging scope by localized, maintainable injections/alterations to the targeted classes (`DjangoHelpFormatter`, command-class factory methods). The new formatter implementation explicitly utilizes `textwrap` for text pre-wrapping and fix placement addresses substantive command need thereby rectifying formatting requirement gaps.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
