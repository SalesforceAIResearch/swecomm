The patch changes the assignment `opts = cur_model._meta` to `opts = cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` when traversing relationships in queries. This change makes sure that the meta options used relate to the underlying concrete model rather than the proxy model, addressing the issue where the primary key wasn't correctly identified.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied in the correct location. The line targeted in `django/db/models/sql/query.py` is within a method responsible for traversing model metadata during query construction. Changing `opts` to correctly reference the concrete model's metadata (`concrete_model._meta`) aligns directly with the issue's proposed manual fix and its description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues** \n\n<new_issues_exp>\nUpon reviewing the related code spans, it does not appear that the patch introduces any new issues or contradicts with any identified code spans. The change is limited to one line and ensures that `opts` references the metadata of the correct model (concrete rather than proxy), avoiding disruptions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue** \n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fits the identified issue's context well and directly references the manual fix suggested, which resolved the problem as indicated. It shifts the focus to the concrete model\u2019s metadata (which includes the primary keys), logically preventing the `ValueError` where the ID wasn\u2019t found. It adheres to changing `opts` as focused only on fixing one field reference in the query relationship traversal process.\nCommon LLM mistakes such as unnecessary refactoring or introducing additional variables are avoided.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Since proxy models are involved, this code span helps in understanding how proxy and non-abstract parent models are determined and set up.\n\n2. `QuerySet`:\nDefines the `QuerySet` class in Django, which includes methods for database lookups like `select_related()` and `only()`. This class is central to the issue as the problem occurs when calling `select_related` and `only` in combination.\n\n3. `QuerySet.select_related`:\nDetails the `select_related` method relevant to generating a Django query that selects related objects. This is relevant because `select_related()` appears before the `only()` and affects how data is pulled from the database.\n\n4. `RelatedPopulator.populate`:\nMethod used for populating `select_related` models. The traceback specifically mentions `RelatedPopulator`, which hints that the problem might involve how the model data is being extracted and structured.\n\n5. `QuerySet.only`:\nA method for restricting the returned fields in a query, present in the sequence encountering the issue. It ensures only the desired fields are fetched, directly affecting how `select_related()` works.\n\n6. `RelatedPopulator`:\nClass used to instantiate models specified in `select_related()`.

The modified hunk updates the assignment of `opts` from `cur_model._meta` to `cur_model._meta.concrete_model._meta` in the Query class. This change ensures that even for proxy models, the queries will correctly reference the concrete ancestor class's metadata rather than mistakenly working with potentially derived proxy models' metadata. It follows the solution path identified in the issue description.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the correct function in the information provided. It tackles the problem at the root cause, which is assigning `opts` under Django's SQL query processing pipeline when handling select-related commands.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce new issues as it follows the provided solution approach effectively. There is also no evident contradiction within the identified code spans since the fix involves subtly switching hierarchy level, transparent to higher operations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch is appropriately fixing the identified issue involving proxy models when using `select_related()` and `only()` together in a QuerySet. This targeted adjustment ensures proper model aliasing, addressing the root mentioned in the traceback. The solution prevents potential ValueError related to finding 'id' within view hierarchy changes, often overlooked when proxy models are improperly referenced, aligning with common fix themes around such attribute resolvers.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
