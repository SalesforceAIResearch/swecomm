It might need changes to inject SCRIPT_NAME.\n- media: Related to the media context, similar to the `static context`, the handling should take `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n- PrefixNode: Involves static nodes handling which configures URL-prefixes, essential for applying `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n- StaticNode.render: Essential for applying `SCRIPT_NAME` to formed URLs dynamically se.\n- StaticNode: Similar to StaticNode.render, applies all required changes at node computation level.\n- StaticNode.handle_simple: Constructs simple URLs, hence should integrate `SCRIPT_NAME`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py`, updated lines 142-144:\n  - This modification introduces the dynamic inclusion of `SCRIPT_NAME` to `final_url` by retrieving the `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` attribute from Django settings as a fallback if not explicitly provided.\n\n- `django/template/defaulttags.py`, updated lines 455-456:\n  - This change dynamically includes the `SCRIPT_NAME` from the request's META attributes to the URL when rendering, assisting runtime adaptation in different hosting contexts.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies appropriate locations; `django/contrib/staticfiles/storage.py` manages storage-specific URL handling crucial for static file inclusion. Also, `django/template/defaulttags.py` ensures TEMPLATE dynamics by pre-penalizing `SCRIPT_NAME` to final URLs dynamically enhancing maintenance for sub-path hosted apps.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch may be introducing new issues. Specifically:\n- Getting `FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME` from settings under storage but not addressing if SCRIPT_NAME keeps it unfiltered suggesting likely mis-integrated/ redundant risk.\n- manually Checking `context.request`.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't appear to wholly contradict any of the identified spans directly. However, a noteworthy concern arises from context handling - context.request is assumed to be present without providing fallbacks; thus, it can raise exceptions if the `request` didn't have the meta attributes correctly set up, especially outside specific templating scenarios.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch moderately fixes the issue of appending `SCRIPT_NAME`, but certain common pitfalls include:\n- It incorrectly assumes request.meta availability everywhere `context` is used.\n- It doesn't integrate comprehensively for dynamic contexts, e.g., within combinations/sub-systems of Django or even static configurations dynamically informed, making it incomplete or potentially introducing subtle failures.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n#### 7.

Essential for dynamically incorporating path prefixes from WSGI SCRIPT_NAME into the URL for static resources.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch targets the validation portion of URL return sequence within the static rendering function, ensuring it takes `SCRIPT_NAME` into account. As the template tags (like {% static '...' %}) will dynamically adopt the prefix, it's correctly applied in providing functional addition to dynamic URLs.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe presented patch might assume the existence of `context.request`. However, `context` may come without this in other areas/applications, resulting in potential attributes not existing error. This alteration should include a fallback check for `context.request` to safely handle paths without altering existing setups reliance if not present.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch correctly aims to prepend the `SCRIPT_NAME` from `context.request.META`, its assumed value inclusion lacks gate rules/function calls for non-path applications devoid of `context.request` causing them to break. This essential handling falls as common overlook errors where absence/unavailability poses disruption within unrelated applications.
