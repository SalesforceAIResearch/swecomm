It directly deals with how atoms are identified and filtered in the expression.\n  \n- `Basic`: This code span explains the `Basic` class in SymPy, the base class for all objects which likely affects how atoms and other features are defined and processed. It emphasizes the use of `.args` to access parameters.\n  \n- `Atom`: This describes the `Atom` class which is supposed to represent atomic objects (i.e., those having no subexpressions).

However, the correct behavior should be returning only those objects that have no `.args`, as that is the true definition of a system's leaf node. This change should be made while ensuring it doesn't affect performance.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nList of span ids:\n- Basic.atoms\n- Basic\n- Atom\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Basic.atoms:** This spans the code for the `atoms` method from lines 434 to 512.

The change is made to the `atoms` method, defined within the `Basic` class in `sympy/core/basic.py`, which is exactly where it should be based on the problem description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: New Issues Check \n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues.

It modifies the method `atoms` such that it now checks that the object has no `.args` before adding it to the result set. Therefore, the function's documented behavior is retained accurately without introducing any potential conflicts or issues observed in the provided code spans. The modification will ensure `atoms()` return objects with no arguments, fulfilling the original issue requirements.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n<score>9</score>"
