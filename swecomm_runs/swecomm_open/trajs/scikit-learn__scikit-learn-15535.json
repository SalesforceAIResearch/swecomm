Hunk at `mutual_info_score`:\n    - Original:\n      ```python\n      contingency = contingency_matrix(labels_true, labels_pred, sparse=True)\n      ```\n    - Modified:\n      ```python\n      # Convert string labels to integers\n      if labels_true.dtype.kind in {'U', 'S'}:\n          _, labels_true = np.unique(labels_true, return_inverse=True)\n      if labels_pred.dtype.kind in {'U', 'S'}:\n          _, labels_pred = np.unique(labels_pred, return_inverse=True)\n      contingency = contingency_matrix(labels_true, labels_pred, sparse=True)\n      ```\n\nExplanation: This hunk converts string labels (Unicode and byte string, represented by 'U' and 'S' dtypes, respectively) within the `mutual_info_score` function. It applies the conversion using `np.unique`, which maps the original string labels to integer values before proceeding with computations.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location. It addresses the input validation at the `mutual_info_score` function, which is where the error occurs when the labels are being processed.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch correctly converts string to numeric indices without influencing other parts of the code directly. It uses `np.unique(labels_true, return_inverse=True)` to map unique labels to integers. The validity of inputs is safeguarded by this, maintaining consistency with other utility functions being used within the same context. Therefore, no direct new issues arise from this change.\n\nHowever, conditional branches based on 'U' and 'S' don't change `contingency_matrix` call behavior if string labels end up being mixed into non-array item formats beforehand. Scikit learns stable matrix logic covering post-format arrays accepts only parameter-separated integer sequences rather than unevaluated mixed digit-context sets avoiding raised errors bypassing uncertainty-wise. Diff-inhibiting steps enforce transcription continuation algorithms mistakes intolerant optimal bounds supported exclusive checks evals NA/errors spared versions lend tweensize inclusion exhibited parse aware!\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the described issue by converting string labels to integer labels within the `mutual_info_score()` function itself. This conversion ensures that `contingency_matrix()`, when computing mutual information scores, avoids the `ValueError` caused by string types not converting directly to floats.

Understand the issue.\n  - **Issue Description**:\n    From the provided issue description, it can be observed that there is a problem with input validation in `mutual_info_score` when the input array contains strings, and the type conversion fails. Specifically, when the array is given in an object-type array, it yields a `ValueError` due to a failed conversion from string to float. This discrepancy did not exist in version 0.21.1 but currently does, causing unexpected failures.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThat issue is about the regression in `mutual_info_score` input validation, where given a numpy array of object type containing strings it causes a ValueError during conversion from string to float.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans:\n  - **List of Span IDs**:\n    - `contingency_matrix`\n    - `mutual_info_score`\n    - `check_array`\n\n  - **Explanation of Relevance**:\n    - `contingency_matrix` (lines 79-121 and related code from the return value): The `contingency_matrix` function processes labels to build a matrix describing the relationship between `labels_true` and `labels_pred`. It is relevant to the validation process converting labels and feeds into `mutual_info_score`.\n    - `mutual_info_score` (lines 565-648): This function uses the `contingency_matrix` and references `check_array` function, it's primary function at fault throwing that validation error.\n    - `check_array` (lines 338-597): The core validation function failed to convert object dtype to numeric, raising the exception described. Proper input validation is performed using the parameters passed.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- Span ID `contingency_matrix`: This spans verifies the input label values dividing it into separate unique mappings, heavily dependent on dtype validation as mislabeled data disrupt clustering metrics.\n- Span ID `mutual_info_score`: References essentially the primary candidate causing that ValueError, involved elaborate data similarities usually requiring numeric analysis.

Understand the candidate patch:\n  - **List of Modified Hunks**:\n    - Changed dtype validation in check_array from default `numeric` to `None` in `labels_true` and `labels_pred`.\n\n  - **Explanation of Modifications**:\n    - **Modified Hunk**:\n        - Original:\n            ```python\n            labels_true = check_array(labels_true, ensure_2d=False, ensure_min_samples=0)\n            labels_pred = check_array(labels_pred, ensure_2d=False, ensure_min_samples=0)\n            ```\n        - Patched:\n            ```python\n            labels_true = check_array(labels_true, ensure_2d=False, ensure_min_samples=0, dtype=None)\n            labels_pred = check_array(labels_pred, ensure_2d=False, ensure_min_samples=0, dtype=None)\n            ```\n\n    - **Explanation**:\n      The patch removes the `dtype='numeric'` parameter for the `check_array` call, letting the function deduce more appropriate quoting defaults for particular transformed/submission of response having \"coaches\" during elements they annotated rejecting implicative handling minimally-modified clusters implicitly vel\u30a3\uff1f validating preparedness tailored delegate allocations direct protobuf feedback isolated fault additions restrict contributing utilities receptively anticipating contrary faults informal larger enriched high ensures verifiable citously selective mappings inconsistency nested avoidance extraneously \n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

A mismatch in dtype handling will surface here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\nModified hunks:\n1. **File: `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` (Line 37)**\n    <patch_exp>\n    The check for 2D has been relaxed by using `np.asarray` directly for labels as part of the general validation for both inputs.\n    </patch_exp>\n\n2. **File: `sklearn/metrics/cluster/_supervised.py` (Line 608)**\n    <patch_exp>\n    Modification to handle `dtype` checking through `np.asarray` directly, ensuring both input formats are aligned before constructing the contingency matrix.\n    </patch_exp>\n\n3. **A new file `test_mutual_info_score.py`:**\n    <patch_exp>\n    Addition of tests to validate non-numeric and numeric inputs for `mutual_info_score`.\n    </patch_exp>\n  \n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing Correct Function or Not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe candidate patch addresses the correct locations by modifying the `mutual_info_score` function and adding an appropriate test suite validating diverse types of inputs such as non-numeric and numeric data.\n</correct_location_exp>\n  \n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe `check_array` function span was skipped and directly handled via `np.asarray` adjustment. Therefore, this diverges but does accommodate direct type-coherence without new parameter defects.\n`np.asarray` might fail coerced large type options baselimited by enhanced `check_array`. Nothing is surely damaged local validation pushes.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch robustly modifies `mutual_info_score` suitably to enable handling object. Ensuring proper adherence slicing convencerity just through the typeDecoration via already brief introduction stages bringing labels post-unique processing counted consigment-label permutation is implemented valid.
