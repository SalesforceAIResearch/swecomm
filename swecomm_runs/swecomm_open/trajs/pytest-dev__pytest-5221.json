Check Correct Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe provided patch modifies the correct class `FixtureDef` in the right module (fixtures.py), assuming that it is part of the necessary changes to expose the scope information. However, it does not directly enhance the `pytest --fixtures` output by itself. For a full solution, `_showfixtures_main` and `showfixtures` functions should also be appropriately modified to utilize `get_scope`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5.

Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch partially addresses the issue in terms of providing an accessor for scope. Nevertheless, it doesn't directly fix the issue of displaying the scope with `pytest --fixtures`. To achieve this, further adjustments are required in the `showfixtures` and `_showfixtures_main` functions where output formatting takes place. Adding scope details (via `get_scope()`) would need inclusion in the display output part in `_showfixtures_main`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. Score the Patch\n<score>3</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using the command `pytest --fixtures`, it doesn't show the scope of the fixtures. Showing the fixture scope with the `pytest --fixtures` command would be useful for users, as currently they have to check the documentation or the source code to figure it out.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. span_id: _showfixtures_main\n2. span_id: showfixtures\n\nExplanation:\n- `_showfixtures_main` (span_id: _showfixtures_main): This function is used to compile and display the available fixtures when the `pytest --fixtures` command is run. It is essential for correctly displaying fixture information.\n- `showfixtures` (span_id: showfixtures): This function acts as an entry point when the `pytest --fixtures` command is invoked. It connects the command-line option with the function that processes and displays fixture details.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified hunk 1: `pytest_cmdline_main` function\n    - Before Patch:\n        ```python\n        if config.option.showfixtures:\n            showfixtures(config)\n            return 0\n        ```\n    - After Patch:\n        ```python\n        if config.option.showfixtures:\n            print(\"Showing fixtures with scope:\")\n            showfixtures(config)\n            return 0\n        ```\n    - Explanation: This change adds a print statement \"Showing fixtures with scope:\" just before calling the `showfixtures` function.\n\n2. Modified hunk 2: Addition of scope display in `write_fixture` within `_show_fixtures_per_test`\n    - Before Patch:\n        ```python\n        tw.line(funcargspec, green=True)\n        ```\n    - After Patch:\n        ```python\n        scope = fixture_def.scope if hasattr(fixture_def, 'scope') else 'unknown'\n        tw.line(\"{:<40} [{}]\".format(funcargspec, scope), green=True)\n        ```\n    - Explanation: This change modifies the output to include the scope of each fixture in square brackets.\n\n3. Modified hunk 3: Addition of scope display in `_showfixtures_main_concise`\n    - Before Patch:\n        ```python\n        tw.line(funcargspec, green=True)\n        ```\n    - After Patch:\n        ```python\n        scope = fixture_def.scope if hasattr(fixture_def, 'scope') else 'unknown'\n        tw.line(\"{:<40} [{}]\".format(funcargspec, scope), green=True)\n        ```\n    - Explanation: Adds scope display to the concise fixture summary view.\n\n4. Modified hunk 4: Addition of scope display in `_showfixtures_main`\n    - Before Patch:\n        ```python\n        tw.line(funcargspec, green=True)\n        ```\n    - After Patch:\n        ```python\n        scope = fixturedef.scope if hasattr(fixturedef, 'scope') else 'unknown'\n        tw.line(\"{:<40} [{}]\".format(funcargspec, scope), green=True)\n        ```\n    - Explanation: Ensures the fixture scope is included in the comprehensive fixture list.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the right functions to display the fixture scope. The changes are applied in the `_showfixtures_main`, `_showfixtures_main_concise`, and other related functions that deal with fixture information display.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues were introduced by the patch. The changes are consistent with the original intent of the `showfixtures` functions and don't contradict or disrupt identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue. It ensures that the scope of the fixtures is displayed alongside the fixture names in both verbose and concise views. The enhancements are consistent and provide the necessary feature to resolve the reported issue effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
