This error started occurring with Matplotlib version 3.6.3.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about a bug that occurs when updating the normalization to LogNorm on a colorbar after it already exists in Matplotlib version 3.6.3.

Conflicts with existing code spanning are less likely in this trivial adjustment of condition checking.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Effectiveness of Fix\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch corrects the condition to individually check for finite values using `np.isfinite()` directly on `t_vmin` and `t_vmax`. This addresses issues of the validity of vmin or vmax causing failure when analibrating colorbars, aligning with a cleaner logic check. However, given that the individual check does the same as the all-check, improving the clarity but not actually addressing the known LLLM-related vector-wise check issue. There is also alignment in keeping `x = self.norm(x)` from calling with negative boundaries. Despite partial weak success on concept to align norm setting logic, overall, continuity it's less effective on other lingering value invalid pushes on calls across ScalarMappable versions sequence mapping functions maintains underlying assign limitation bugs compromising on full successful fixing.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>3</score>"

Any propagation of norm changes to a colorbar could be connected to this component.\n\n6. `Colorbar.update_normal`:\n    Crucial for synchronizing a colorbar with a mappable's normalization. If this process has shortcomings, changing the norm could cause the described bug.\n\n7. `Normalize.__call__`:\n    Handles the actual normalization of data points into the normalized interval. Faults in this function can directly lead to errors when vmin and vmax are not manageable.\n\n8. `impl:25`:\n    Defines how logarithmic normalization is applied/created, which is directly involved since the issue concerns `LogNorm`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understanding the Candidate Patch:\n\nModified hunk - `(lib/matplotlib/colors.py` lines 1688-1701):\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk changes the conditionals used in raising a `ValueError` for invalid `vmin` and `vmax` from:\n```python\nnot np.isfinite([t_vmin, t_vmax]).all()\n```\nto:\n```python\nnot np.isfinite(t_vmin) or not np.isfinite(t_vmax)\n```\nThis essentially checks separately if either `t_vmin` or `t_vmax` is non-finite.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking the Correct Function:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the core `__call__` method in `Normalize` class, responsible for transforming the input values into normalized values. Given the error arises while working with normalized values (`LogNorm`), updating these checks here is a likely correct spot.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check for New Issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe code span `lib/matplotlib/colors.py (Normalize.__call__)` verifies `vmin` and `vmax` independently abiding by typical requirements (proper finite values check). The patch should not contradict; rather, it fine-tunes error raising conditions. No new apparent logical contradiction exists with identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Evaluation of the Patch Fixing the Issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThough modifying how 'non-finite' checks are done might bypass robust validation of `vmin` and `vmax`, separation and simplification are beneficial practices given reduced complexity.

Ensuring to raise Error on invalid `vmin`, or `vmax`  during instantiation and value normalization ensures proper behavior avoiding runtime miscalculations.\n4. New tests are added for modification integrity and correctness in `b/lib/matplotlib/tests/test_lognorm.py` covering general, validation behavior.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch appropriately modifies `LogNorm` function within its containing file (`colors.py`). This directly impacts normalization yielding the expected bug fix for getting an acceptable outcome.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are being introduced from the observed changes considering the edits complete gaps with installed validations. Meaning masking incorrect values right during normalization assures higher input remediations for each segment.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the problem as designed checks/effective batching ensure `vmin`, `vmax` correctness, and negl serve zero-edge cases not handled leading to errors invoked previously transforming the plot/superior color schemes onto canvas.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
