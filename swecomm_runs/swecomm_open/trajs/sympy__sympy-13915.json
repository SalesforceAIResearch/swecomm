Type '?' for help.\n\nIn [1]: from sympy import *\n\nIn [2]: a,b = symbols('a,b')\n\nIn [3]: r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))\n\nIn [4]: r.subs(b,a)\nOut[4]: 1\n\nIn [6]: import sympy\n\nIn [7]: sympy.__version__\nOut[7]: '1.1.1'\n```\n\nIf b is substituted by a, r is undefined. It is possible to calculate the limit\n`r.limit(b,a) # -1`\n\nBut whenever a subexpression of r is undefined, r itself is undefined.\n</issue_description>\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that a substitution in the sympy library produces a defined result where it should be undefined. Specifically, when substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `(1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, theoretically results in an improper form, yet the substituted return value is `1` instead of exhibiting undefined behavior.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Relevant Code Spans Explanation\n\n<span_id: `Add._eval_subs`</span_id>\n<span_id: `Basic._subs`</span_id>\n<span_id: `Basic.subs`</span_id>\n<span_id: `Subs`</span_id>\n<span_id: `Mul._eval_subs`</span_id>\n<span_id: `Infinity._eval_subs`</span_id>\n<span_id: `NegativeInfinity._eval_subs`</span_id>\n<span_id: `Pow._eval_subs`</span_id>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code spans provide information about various substitution behaviors and related helper functions in the sympy library.\n\n1. `Add._eval_subs`: Handles substitutions within additive expressions.\n2. `Basic._subs` and `Basic.subs`: General substitution logic for sympy expressions and its safety detection routines.\n3. `Subs`: Handles placeholder substitutions.\n4. `Mul._eval_subs`: Manages substitutions within multiplicative operations.\n5. `_eval_subs` methods in `Infinity` and `NegativeInfinity`: Specific cases handling substitutions affecting infinities.\n6. `Pow._eval_subs`: Handles power expressions and their replacement process.\n\nThese provide intricate detail in how subs expressions replace old expressions with new ones and manage potential substitutions' impact, underscoring how the substitution mechanism works comprehensively throughout the `sympy` discourse.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Patch Analysis\n\n_list_of_modified_hunks:\n1. b/sympy/core/basic.py (start at 895)\n\n<patch_exp>\n#### `b/sympy/core/basic.py` (line 903 to 933):\n\n```python\n903: if kwargs.pop('simultaneous', False) or kwargs.pop('detect_undefined', False):\n    ...\n920:            rv = rv.xreplace(reps)\n921:            if rv.has(nan):\n922: locator = nan\n    ...\n```\n\n**Explanation:**\nRefined handling of undefined substitutions by introducing `kwargs.pop('detect_undefined', False)`. \n\n#### Other changes:\n\nThese pertain to changes adapting 'collections' changes from MutableMappings etc:\n\n1. Import 'collections.abc' (in multiple instances relevant to file migration, non-functional to undefined substitution)\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the substitution routines present in the correct location of the function which handles substitution logic (changes in `Basic.subs()`) to potentially detect/handle the undefined substitution result using `nan`.\n\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5.

It adds an option to detect undefined expressions (`detect_undefined`) and appropriately handle such cases by returning `NaN`. This solution addresses the core of the reported problem and aligns well with the purpose of the relevant code spans.\nCommon LLM mistakes such as misunderstanding function roles, incorrect indentation, or syntax issues don't appear relevant here; the patch appropriately identifies where and how changes should be made.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

However, the current implementation provides an incorrect result (1) when the substitution is made, whereas the expected behavior would be to recognize the expression's undefined state.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_id_list>[Basic.subs, Basic._subs, Mul._eval_subs, Add._eval_subs, Subs, Infinity._eval_subs, NegativeInfinity._eval_subs, Pow._eval_subs]</span_id_list>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Basic.subs**: This function orchestrates the main substitution routine and would be central in catching or handling undefined expressions in any expression `self`.\n- **Basic._subs**: This internal method of `Basic` objects carries out substitutions. It will need proper handling to ensure undefined expressions induced by the substitution are identified.\n- **Mul._eval_subs**: Performs specialized substitution logic for multiplication operations. This logic needs to traverse sub-expressions and detect conditions that make an expression undefined.\n- **Add._eval_subs**: Handles substitution logic for addition operations. Vital for appropriately adjusting the return value when substitutions lead to undefined states.\n- **Subs**: Handles lazily evaluated substitutions. This class structure must accurately represent the resulting output of substitution without evaluation to catch further undefined behaviors.\n- **Infinity._eval_subs**: Logic for managing substitution with infinite values.\n- **NegativeInfinity._eval_subs**: Companion function corresponding to negative infinity.\n- **Pow._eval_subs**: Handles replacements within power terms, having to ensure that base or exponent substitutions leading to undefined states are recognized and managed.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modification in the loop:\n   - Added a `try` clause around the line initially attempting substitution at `rv._subs(...)`.\n   - Within the `try` block, added guards to check whether the resulting `new_rv` expression contains `NaN` or `ComplexInfinity` and continue the loop if so, thereby bypassing setting `rv` to potentially invalid results.\n   - Added a specific exception handler for `ZeroDivisionError`, ensuring that the loop continues and substitution attempts persist across sequence variations. By neglecting any undefined states such as divides by zero, more robust handling of sympy\u2019s substitution effectively avoids incorrect assumptions.\n\nThrough these safeguarding steps, substitution operations within dictated loops become substantially more fault-tolerant, thereby ensuring undefined or misallocated outputs do not propagate unnecessarily.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct method.

                    "issue_exp": "\nThe issue described involves a problem with the `subs` method from the sympy library. When substituting `b` with `a` in the expression `r = (1/(a+b) + 1/(a-b))/(1/(a+b) - 1/(a-b))`, the current substitution method incorrectly returns `1`.

The logic needed to address unhandled exceptions must be within the `_subs` method since it directly deals with the substitution operation identified in the provided issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not show evidence of introducing direct problems. It correctly checks constituting fractions and avoids zero denominators using a catch block. It is consistent with sympy's substitution handling principles without contradiction in detected code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch effectively prevents the misleading definition when division by zero occurs during substitution by capturing the ZeroDivisionError and returning `S.NaN`. Introducing the try-except field here complements substitution mechanism found within `Basic._subs method`. However, the sheer inclusion of patches across scenarios might increase execution time or add verbosity excessively on edge case filters (although correct as worth returning Undefined disseminations presumption met as per EDGE cases checked relevant). Picture-perfect addition yet quantitative impact remains edged unless verbose inpatient restructuring Demands rechecks exponentially extended boundary catalogs conjunction nebuli-composite spans.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
