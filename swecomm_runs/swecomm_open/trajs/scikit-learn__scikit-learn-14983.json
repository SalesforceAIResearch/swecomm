This code span reveals an existing pattern that can be replicated in other classes to fix the `__repr__` issue.\n\n**_RepeatedSplits**\n- This portion of the code consists of the base class `_RepeatedSplits` which provides the common structure for repeated splits cross validator. It outlines parameters and their significance. Ensuring its `__repr__` inherits or defines correctly will fix one aspect of the issue.\n\n**RepeatedStratifiedKFold**\n- Depicts definitions for `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, which inherits `_RepeatedSplits`. Currently, there's no descriptive `__repr__` which encapsulates its parameters like `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`. Enhancing its `__repr__` fix would help illustrate the fixed state.\n\n**RepeatedKFold**\n- Similar to `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, this describes `RepeatedKFold`. Additionally, it lacks an adequate `__repr__` to present specific parameters. Aligning its `__repr__` to satisfy the descriptive need is necessary to address the raised issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n**Modified Hunks:**\n- **Hunk in `BaseCrossValidator class in _split.py`:**\n  - `__repr__` method is added into `BaseCrossValidator` class which utilizes `_build_repr` to print a descriptive string representation of the respective objects specifically aimed at `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n\n**Explanation:**\n- This hunk enhances the `BaseCrossValidator` class where many cross-validation classes inherit from. With the new change, when invoking `repr()`, it will provide a more meaningful and comprehensive reflection of the parameters tied to the cross-validator objects, resolving the outlined problem.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch partially addresses the correct location. The root issue spans the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` and they do inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`. However, addressing or verifying if `BaseCrossValidator` touches only these specific sub-classes might not fully determine resolution completeness unless linked members inherently utilize this addition ensuring alignment among flexible class structures that inherit the same.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nYes, the patch might introduce issues. Since the patch changes `BaseCrossValidator`, this change can have unintended side effects on other classes inheriting from it which might not require customized `__repr__` handling as expected only for `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`. No more context is given atop whether if some classes deploy explicit __repr slump already. This assurance makes universal fixing lead to new discrepancies, if less regarded.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch's purpose and location directly likely fix the proposed problem by centralizing `__repr__` for consistency in `BaseCrossValidator`\u2014desirable change when usage aligns thoroughly.

Instead of showing a detailed human-readable summary of the object's configuration, the `__repr__` method currently returns an unhelpful string that shows the memory address of the object. The expectation is that the `__repr__` should return a string that provides all relevant parameter values of the instance.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan Ids: [\"BaseEstimator.__repr__\", \"_RepeatedSplits\", \"RepeatedStratifiedKFold\", \"RepeatedKFold\"]\n\n1. `BaseEstimator.__repr__`: This code span contains the `__repr__` method for the `BaseEstimator` class. It is relevant as it shows an example of how a properly formatted `__repr__` can be implemented in the scikit-learn library. A similar approach could potentially be applied to the `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes to fix their representations.\n\n2. `_RepeatedSplits`: This class is a base class that defines shared behavior for repeated splits in cross-validation. Both `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit from this class, making it a central point if changes are needed to affect both.\n\n3. `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`: This is one of the classes mentioned in the issue. It inherits from `_RepeatedSplits` and performs repeat stratified K-Fold cross validation. The issue specifically calls out this class for having an inappropriate `__repr__` implementation.\n\n4. `RepeatedKFold`: This is the other class mentioned in the issue. Like `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, it also inherits from `_RepeatedSplits` and is responsible for performing repeated K-Fold cross-validation. This class\u2019s `__repr__` also needs to be updated to provide a human-readable summary.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n- `a/sklearn/model_selection/_split.py:46`: Addition of the `__repr__` method implementing `_build_repr(self)` to the `BaseCrossValidator` class.\n\nExplanation of each hunk:\n1. In the `BaseCrossValidator` class, a new `__repr__` function has been added which uses the `_build_repr(self)` method. This ensures that the string representation of objects of this class and any subclass thereof (that doesn't override `__repr__`) will be generated by `_build_repr`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is not fixing the correct function directly. The classes `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` do not inherit from `BaseCrossValidator`. They both inherit from `_RepeatedSplits`, which is a separate class hierarchy. The correct place to implement the `__repr__` method should be either in `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` directly, or in `_RepeatedSplits` to address both classes together.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch adds a `__repr__` method to `BaseCrossValidator` which doesn't seem to cause new issues in that class. However, since neither `RepeatedKFold` nor `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` inherit from this class, the patch does not resolve the problem and might confuse future maintenance efforts thinking the problem is solved when it isn't.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not fix the issue because it incorrectly modifies the `BaseCrossValidator` class, which is not relevant to `_RepeatedSplits` and its subclasses `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`, where the actual issue resides. Common mistakes like modifying an unrelated class or misunderstanding class hierarchies are indeed present here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>-1</score>"

Instead of showing the expected human-readable format with the attributes `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`, they display the default object reference location, which makes it difficult to understand the initialization parameters visually during debugging.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nIdentified span ids:\n- BaseEstimator.__repr__\n- _RepeatedSplits\n- RepeatedStratifiedKFold\n- RepeatedKFold\n\n1. `BaseEstimator.__repr__`:\nThe base `__repr__` method shared by estimators in `sklearn`. This method is leveraged to provide a comprehensive representation of sklearn estimators including the populated attributes. Rather than implementing a custom `__repr__` method, this reusable method from `BaseEstimator` could be used within the respective functionality.\n\n2. `_RepeatedSplits`:\nAbstract base class designed for repeated splits using arbitrary randomized cross-validation splitters (`cv`). Clarifies the available parameters and information between `RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`.\n\n3. `RepeatedStratifiedKFold`:\nSpecific class implementing repeated stratified K-Fold cross-validator. Contains the parameters such as `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` that are relevant to include in the `__repr__` output. \n\n4. `RepeatedKFold`:\nThis class creates repeated K-Fold cross-validation splits. Similarly, it incorporates crucial parameters related to the `__repr__` method\u2014`n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state`\u2014used to reflect the meaningful internal state.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified hunk in `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` beginning at approximately line 1219:\n   This modification adds a `__repr__` method to the `RepeatedKFold` class. The method constructs a string representing the internal state of the object using formatted string interpolation to include `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` attributes.\n\n2. Modified hunk in `sklearn/model_selection/_split.py` occurring around line 1275:\n   This adjustment introduces a `__repr__` method to the `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` class identical in functionality to the previous hunk, outlining object details as attributes in string format for accurate `__repr__` visualization.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct functions\u2014`RepeatedKFold` and `RepeatedStratifiedKFold` classes\u2014by adding `__repr__` methods to return the intended user-friendly representation strings.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues, nor does it contradict any of the identified code spans. `__repr__` methods prioritize simplicity and efficiency, majorly influencing testing and debugging aided by better clarity from object representation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by ensuring that the `__repr__` methods for both classes return strings detailing the `n_splits`, `n_repeats`, and `random_state` attributes. This represents a proper solution without signs of common pitfalls, such as incorrectly accessing instance variables, omitting key attributes, or using an improper method or style. This approach follows best practices attempting to fix the user's reported issue comprehensively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

However, given the class constructions in `_RepeatedSplits`, this does appear to be addressed.\n\nThus, the patch appears suitable in solving the issue at hand.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
