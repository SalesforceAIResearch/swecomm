Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is integrated into the correct function, `display_for_field`.

Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch introduces handling logic for JSONField in admin listings and uses `field.value_from_object`, which prevents the use of Python dict format and keeps formatting consistent, there are considerations:\n- The patch doesn't directly include a call to the `prepare_value` method, as recommended in the issue description.\n- Using `value_from_object` versus performing JSON encoding internally does follow a Django pattern, but it's unclear if it conforms to user-specific JSON encoding desires without significant errors.\n- Risks remain since it is unclear whether `field.value_from_object(value)` correctly handles all JSONField embeddings.\n\nGiven these considerations, the patch partially addresses the visible formatting issue but could miss finer points concerning error-handling or internal mappings of Django for such value preparations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

We need to ensure JSONField is properly displayed in its context.\n4. **JSONField**: This is the class definition for `JSONField` in Django's models, indicating how JSON objects are processed and stored.\n5. **JSONField.get_prep_value**: This function handles JSON encoding when preparing JSON data for database input, showcasing how JSONField performs JSON serialization.\n6. **imports (json.py)**: This span includes import statements in `json.py`, potentially affecting how JSON serialization methods are accessed or expanded.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunks:\n1. Added support for `models.JSONField` in the `display_for_field` function.\n\nExplanation:\n1. A new condition was added to the `elif` chain in `display_for_field` to handle fields of type `models.JSONField`. Instead of using `json.dumps` directly, the patch calls `field.value_from_object(value)` to retrieve the field\u2019s prepared, serialized value which respects the handling methods defined in the JSONField class.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location. Updating the `display_for_field` function of `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` to correctly handle JSONField when it is readonly is exactly where this change should be made to fix the described issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are being introduced. The patch aligns with the identified spans, especially ensuring compatibility with how JSONField methods operate. It properly uses the `value_from_object` method already defined for model fields, respecting Django's internal data preparation conventions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch indeed appears to resolve the root of the issue by formatting JSONField in a manner conducive to being displayed as valid JSON instead of a Python dict. Common mistakes to check against are ensuring the converted data type of JSONField aligns with a series of Django\u2019s field formatting\u2014handled here by its prep method ensures serialization is properly translated back for quick-read outputs.\n\nThus, in summary:\n- The new `elif` condition added caters specifically for JSONField.\n- No regression for other field types within `display_for_field`.\n- Correct usage methodology for inbuilt Django field methods.\n\nThus, this patch likely correctly tackles the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The suggested fix is to add a special case in the `display_for_field` function in `django.contrib.admin.utils` to utilize the `prepare_value` method of JSONField for proper formatting.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code spans are:\n1. imports (span_id: 'imports' from django/contrib/admin/utils.py).\n2. display_for_value (span_id: 'display_for_value' from django/contrib.admin/utils.py).\n3. display_for_field (span_id: 'display_for_field' from django/contrib.admin/utils.py).\n4.

Span ID: 'imports' from `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` includes necessary Django utilities and formatting functions which are potentially relevant for converting and formatting data gracefully in the admin views.\n2. Span ID: 'display_for_value' defines a method responsible for rendering values in Django admin depending on their type.\n3. Span ID: 'display_for_field' defines a method directly related to field-wise value rendering, incorporating JSONFields for our purpose.\n4. Span ID: 'JSONField' provides fundamental definitions regarding JSONField structure in Django.\n5. Span ID: 'JSONField.get_prep_value' contains specifics related to how JSONField prepares its values (notably going through `prepare_value` which is proposed for dealing with readonly fields).\n6. Span ID: 'imports' from `django/db/models/fields/json.py` typically houses the JSON module import along with other essential Django imports involved in model operations.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified hunks:\n1. Hunks in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py`:\n   - Added a new elif check for `models.JSONField` (line 401).\n   - Used `field.prepare_value` of the JSONField to ensure JSON values are correctly formatted.\n\nExplanation:\n- A new conditional block (`elif isinstance(field, models.JSONField)`) has been inserted to check if the field type is a JSONField. Handling it by calling `field.prepare_value(value)` ensures JSON data is correctly serialized back to valid JSON before rendering in the admin view.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct function. The `display_for_field` function in `django/contrib/admin/utils.py` handles the rendition of form field values in Django admin, and introducing the check and corresponding preparation for JSONFields at this junction is appropriate.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues. It consists of a straightforward addition without removing or altering any pre existing case structures that share mutual exclusivity. The `display_for_value` function already had diversity management criteria covering various cases and this addition maintains accidental pungency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch sufficiently addresses the issue by ensuring that JSONField values are properly rendered as JSON rather than a dict. Instead of displaying Python's dict-like object notation, the legible JSON is made by calling `field.prepare_value`. None of the common mistakes typically pointed by LLM-generated patches such as incomplete changes, missing imports or unmet considerations are conspicuous here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

If `prepare_value` is not a callable method of `JSONField` or if `field` is not guaranteed to always be an instance of `JSONField`.\n2. There's a potential contradiction between JSONField's `get_prep_value` method in `django/db/models/fields/json.py` that assumes the presence of an `encoder` attribute and how `field.prepare_value(value)` would work.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch should be re-evaluated for robustness due to the possibility that `field.prepare_value` might not be a method for certain Django versions or user implementations of JSONField, and verifying beforehand if the `field` indeed has this method.\nMoreover, the fix directly uses `prepare_value` of JSONField but doesn't check if `field` is indeed JSONField. Adding explicit checks or ensuring `field.prepare_value` is callable would strengthen the fix. Additionally, `field.prepare_value` may raise `InvalidJSONInput`, which the patch does not handle.\nGiven common pitfalls of LLM-generated patches, such as incorrect assumptions of callable methods or neglecting type validations, these concerns should be addressed.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n<score>6</score>"

Given the info, it directly aligns with fixing the mentioned issue, and does ensure read-only fields output correctly-formatted JSON.\n\nHowever, a small limitation is the nested check protocol within `display_for_field` already long and could be refactoring into more readable methods. This would it massively simplify debugging and extensibility later.\n\n\n<string xmlns=\"URN Dbank replacement autoretry non determined extent enough foreign um feedback media chapter apply total LAN
