After Line 611 in `b/sympy/utilities/lambdify.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The hunk modifies the `lambdify.py` file to ensure that not only the arguments (`args`) but also the expression (`expr`) are properly substituted based on the dummification logic.

Based on the issue description, the problem occurs during the lambdify process.

To change this behavior, the\n+    \"modules\" argument can be used. It accepts:\n+\n+     - the strings \"math\", \"mpmath\", \"numpy\", \"numexpr\", \"sympy\", \"tensorflow\"\n+     - any modules (e.g. math)\n+     - dictionaries that map names of sympy functions to arbitrary functions\n+     - lists that contain a mix of the arguments above, with higher priority\n+       given to entries appearing first.\n+\n+    .. warning::\n+        Note that this function uses ``eval``, and thus shouldn't be used on\n+        unsanitized input.\n+\n+    Arguments in the provided expression that are not valid Python identifiers\n+    are substitued with dummy symbols. This allows for applied functions\n+    (e.g. f(t)) to be supplied as arguments.

Please note that the available functions\n+    for numexpr are more limited than numpy but can be expanded with\n+    implemented_function and user defined subclasses of Function.

The newly added tests explicitly validate that the specific errors in question no longer occur and ensure the implementation works as intended.\n\nOverall validation indicates the patch resolves the specified problem without harming other functionalities or codes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
