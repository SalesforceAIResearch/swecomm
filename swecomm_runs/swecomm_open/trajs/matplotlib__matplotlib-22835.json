The patch correctly applies a try-except block around this location to handle the potential `ValueError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are introduced by this patch.

The `try-except` block introduced prevents the crash and defaults `g_sig_digits` to a consistent value of 3 in case of this error, preserving continuity in processing.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The patch introduces a try-except block around lines that handle normalization and axis information processing via `self.norm.inverse`. Specifically, it catches the `ValueError` thrown by BoundaryNorm\u2019s inverse method and provides a default value of 3 for 'g_sig_digits' if a ValueError is raised. This prevents the crash from halting execution.\n\n```python\ntry:\n  neighbors = self.norm.inverse(\n    (int(self.norm(data) * n) + np.array([0, 1])) / n\n  )\n  delta = abs(neighbors - data).max()\n  g_sig_digits = cbook._g_sig_digits(data, delta)\nexcept ValueError:\n  g_sig_digits = 3\n```\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly addresses the `BoundaryNorm` inversion issue in the `format_cursor_data` method by catching the `ValueError` and gracefully assigning default values, preventing the crash.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch does not contradict any of the identified code spans. The try-except block safely wraps the corresponding code to avoid crashing, thereby maintaining consistency with how other potential exceptions are gracefully managed in the method.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch properly addresses the issue by avoiding the direct call to the non-invertible function and handling potential errors gracefully. One possible mistake, however, might be overlooking scenarios where understanding why certain mappings were not invertible is useful. Hence, capturing specifics on the value that led to the `ValueError` might be beneficial for deeper debugging but is beyond eliminating the crash and suffices here. This does not fall into any common file mismanagement issues made by LLMs and remains the proper concise solution.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

While a try-except block handles the error gracefully, one common LLM mistake might include improperly setting default values. In this context, though, defaulting to precision digits shouldn't harm.\nSome checks are missing like having informative logging or a better display message around failed operations can offer added benefits. These adaptations help us verify if similar cases handle comprehensive adjustability yet meeting logical accuracy. However, the fundamental requirement effectively avoids crashing scenarios seems satisfactorily met.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It\u2019s important for the issue as this is the exact point causing the crash described.\n\n3. **BoundaryNorm.__call__**: This is the main method transforming data according to the BoundaryNorm rules. Understanding this method helps confirm `BoundaryNorm`'s functionality and constraints affecting how formats might be handled.\n\n4. **BoundaryNorm.__init__**: This constructor initializes the BoundaryNorm object with parameters and determines its properties like boundaries and colors range, introducing constraints that affect its functional behavior.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patched_hunks>\n1. **Hunk 1** in `lib/matplotlib/cm.py`:\n   Added a method `format_cursor_data_with_norm` to `ScalarMappable` for special handling when `self.norm` is an instance of `BoundaryNorm`.\n   \n2. **Hunk 2** in `lib/matplotlib/image.py`:\n   Added a method `format_cursor_data` in `AxesImage` for special handling and avoided calling invertible norm methods directly.\n   \n3. **Hunk 3** in `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_boundary_norm_cursor.py`:\n   Added a test case specifically for the crash to ensure values within the boundary norm range are rendered correctly in cursor data without throwing errors.\n</patched_hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**: Introduced an exception handler within the `ScalarMappable` class to appropriately format data when the normalization is a `BoundaryNorm`, capturing a `try-except` construct optimized for the inherent non-invertibility of `BoundaryNorm`.\n\n2. **Hunk 2**: Incorporated a method override in the `AxesImage` class for the cursor data format specific to handling potential normalization issues with `BoundaryNorm`. This uses the method within `ScalarMappable`.\n\n3. **Hunk 3**: Implemented a test for various scenarios assessing data formatting with boundaries to ensure stability and correctness, addressing both in-boundary and out-boundary and handling `None` gracefully.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct functions in the `ScalarMappable` and `AxesImage` class methods likely associated with the crash resulted in `BoundaryNorm`\u2019s non-invertibility.

This ensures `format_cursor_data` won't crash with `BoundaryNorm` during the interaction.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't appear to introduce any new issues or contradictions with identified code spans. It enhances functionality, and headers off potential misuse of `BoundaryNorm.inverse`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the issue by handling BoundaryNorm separately without making invertible assumptions. The common mistake patch avoided was altering the actual non-invertible nature of `BoundaryNorm` inappropriate, ensuring backward-compatible behavior. Tests supplement correctness ensuring correct fix.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
