Insertion of `_print_Indexed` method.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Insertion of `_print_Indexed` method**:\n   - **Before**:\n     ```python\n     def _print_Function(self, e):\n         x = self.dom.createElement(\"apply\")\n         x.appendChild(self.dom.createElement(self.mathml_tag(e)))\n         for arg in e.args:\n             x.appendChild(self._print(arg))\n         return x\n\n     def _print_Basic(self, e):\n         x = self.dom.createElement(self.mathml_tag(e))\n         for arg in e.args:\n             x.appendChild(self._print(arg))\n         return x\n     ```\n\n   - **After**:\n     ```python\n     def _print_Function(self, e):\n         x = self.dom.createElement(\"apply\")\n         x.appendChild(self.dom.createElement(self.mathml_tag(e)))\n         for arg in e.args:\n             x.appendChild(self._print(arg))\n         return x\n  \n     def _print_Indexed(self, e):\n         x = self.dom.createElement(\"apply\")\n         x.appendChild(self._print(e.base))\n         for index in e.indices:\n             x.appendChild(self._print(index))\n         return x\n\n     def _print_Basic(self, e):\n         x = self.dom.createElement(self.mathml_tag(e))\n         for arg in e.args:\n             x.appendChild(self._print(arg))\n         return x\n     ```\n\n   **Explanation**: The `_print_Indexed` method is introduced to provide a way to correctly print `Indexed` objects into MathML. The method processes the base of the indexed object and its indices correctly making them individually printable elements.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Is the Patch Fixing the Correct Function?\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly fixing the function responsible for printing `Indexed` objects to MathML. The new `_print_Indexed` method is precisely where such logic needs to be applied.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Is the Patch Introducing New Issues?\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo, the patch is not introducing new issues. There are no explicit contradictions with the identified code spans, as the inserted method only adds functionality needed to handle `Indexed` objects correctly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Can the Patch Fix the Issue? \n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch accurately addresses the issue of converting `Indexed` objects to MathML by iterating the `base` and `indices` attributes correctly. It avoids the issue of improperly treating `Indexed` objects as non-iterable, hence should resolve the `TypeError`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understand the Issue**\n<issue_exp>\n\nThe issue is that when trying to write an `Indexed` object to MathML using `sympy.printing.mathml`, it results in a `TypeError` stating that `'Indexed' object is not iterable`. This problem leads to a failure in outputting `Indexed` objects as MathML and affects any more complex expressions where at least one element is an `Indexed` object.\n\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**\n   - List of span IDs: MathMLContentPrinter, MathMLPrinterBase, MathMLPresentationPrinter, print_mathml, IndexedBase, Indexed.indices, IndexedBase.__new__, Indexed.__new__, Indexed.base, Indexed, IndexedBase.__getitem__\n\n<code_span_exp>\n\n1. **MathMLContentPrinter (line 119)**:\n   This class is responsible for printing expressions to the Content MathML markup language. It's relevant because it ties directly into the `MathMLPrinterBase` where custom print methods such as `_print_Indexed` would be added.\n\n2. **MathMLPrinterBase (line 15)**:\n   This class is a common base for MathML printers and contains the common methods and attributes required by all such printers. Changes to handle specific printing tasks, like `_print_Indexed`, need to be coherent with this base class.\n\n3. **MathMLPresentationPrinter (line 481)**:\n   Similar to `MathMLContentPrinter`, but for presentation MathML markup. Maintains structural printing consistency.\n\n4. **print_mathml (line 1284)**:\n   This function prints the MathML code for an expression, differentiating between presentation or content-oriented printing. It must invoke a corrected printer that handles `Indexed`.\n\n5. **IndexedBase (line 334)**:\n   Represents the base of an indexed object and returns instances of the `Indexed` class. Ensuring it integrates correctly with the printing methods is fundamental to addressing the issue.\n\n6. **Indexed.indices (line 208)**:\n   The property returns the indices of an `Indexed` object and needs to be iterable in the printing context. Important for fetching indices.\n\n7. **IndexedBase.__new__ (line 389)**:\n   Creates instances of `IndexedBase`. Configuration here (like shape) may influence MathML generation.\n\n8. **Indexed.__new__ (line 140)**:\n   Controls how `Indexed` objects are instantiated. Indicates what `Indexed` will look like, which should then be handled appropriately by the printer.\n\n9. **Indexed.base (line 190)**:\n   Returns the base part of the `Indexed` object. A crucial attribute for recognizing what part of `_print_Indexed` to print first.\n\n10. **Indexed (line 120)**:\n    The class for Mathematical objects with indices. Adding specific print methods such as `_print_Indexed` involves integrating tightly with these definitions.\n\n11. **IndexedBase.__getitem__ (line 425)**:\n    Facilitates the creation of an `Indexed` object with supplied indices, ensuring they can be accessed properly by any fixed printer methods.\n\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n   - List of modified hunks: \n\n     Hunk 1: Adds `_print_Indexed` method to sympy/printing/mathml.py\n\n<patch_exp>\n\n1. **Hunk 1**:\n   - **Definition**:\n       - Adds method `_print_Indexed` to MathMLPrinter class in `sympy/printing/mathml.py`.\n    \n   - **Explanation**:\n     Adds functionality to convert an `Indexed` object: The method creates an `apply` XML element, the base part is appended to apply the element as a child, and then each index in `e.indices` is iterated over and added to the `apply`.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if Patch is in the Correct Location**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\n\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The aggregation of other similarly placed `_print_X` methods for other expressions implies `_print_Indexed` should reasonably exist within the same class and region.\n\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\n\nNo new issues seem introduced; however, the existing methods in the mix belong uniformly with `_print_Indexed`. All properties exploited \u2014 `e.base` navigating the base (span ID: Indexed.base) and `e.indices` (span ID: Indexed.indices) extract indices expectably processed can cohabit frequently and integrally with the printer extension.\n\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Patch Ability to Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n\nThe patch wisely and concisely adjusts MathML printing to account seamlessly for `Indexed` objects following outlined within. This involves breaking the issue abstractions successfully such that non-iterable data orientation errors for user-repres went away. Principally breadth shouldn't have license violation or correctness stuck-up LGS deviations and stringent against regions intuitively purposeful show effectiveness over specific conversion steps engaged.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score**\n\n<score>10</score>"

It's relevant for verifying if the Indexed object gets formatted correctly after the implementation of a fix.\n\n5. **IndexedBase**:\n   This class represents the base of an indexed object. It's directly tied to the problem because it connects with `Indexed` objects which are causing the `TypeError`.\n\n6. **Indexed.indices**:\n   This property returns the indices of the `Indexed` object. It's relevant since the error indicated involves iteration over the elements of `Indexed`.\n\n7. **IndexedBase.__new__**:\n   This constructor method is used for creating `IndexedBase` objects which eventually interact with `Indexed`.\n\n8. **Indexed.__new__**:\n   This constructor method is where `Indexed` objects are created from `IndexedBase`. Relevant because 'Indexed' objects leading to the error are instantiated here.\n\n9. **Indexed.base**:\n   This property returns the `IndexedBase` of the `Indexed` object and is tied to identifying the primary element being referred.\n\n10. **Indexed**: \n   Represents the mathematical object with indices creating the iterable `TypeError`.\n\n11. **IndexedBase.__getitem__**: \n   Retrieves `Indexed` objects from `IndexedBase`, triggering operations resulting in a TypeError.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Modified Hunk 1**: \n  ```\n  (0452)       def _print_Indexed(self, e):\n  (0453)           x = self.dom.createElement('msub')\n  (0454)           x.appendChild(self._print(e.base))\n  (0455)           x.appendChild(self._print(e.indices[0]))\n  (0456)           return x\n  ```\n  Introduces a new method `_print_Indexed` specifically handling the printing of `Indexed` objects inside the MathML printer. The method uses `msub` tags to denote subscripted indices appropriate for MathML representation.\n  \n- **Added Test File**: \n  Provides test cases that call `mathml` on `Indexed` object alongside verification of its printout for both mathml 'content' and 'presentation'. This is helpful for QA verification.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function by adding the `_print_Indexed` method within `MathMLContentPrinter`, which is where printing cases for various mathematical expressions are handled.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to contradict any of the identified code spans. Adding a dedicated method for handling `Indexed` within the MathML printer avoids irrelevant and potentially desirable iterations within general `_print_Basic`. \n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue precisely: encountering the 'Indexed' during MathML print-prefixed relevant `_print_Indexed` functionality to cater where normal iteration fails suitably.
