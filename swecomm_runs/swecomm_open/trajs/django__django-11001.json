The patch introduces a preprocessing step `sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))`, transforming multiline SQL into a single line to avoid errors in the regex-based duplicate detection.

Specifically, when a multiline RawSQL expression has similar concluding lines (`ASC` or `DESC`), it perceives these clauses as duplicates and removes all but the first one. This happens because `ordering_parts.search(sys)` returns only parts of the SQL containing `ASC` or `DESC` and fails to account for the full expressions.\n\n**Explanation:**\n<issue_exp>\nThe function `SQLCompiler.get_order_by` is incorrectly identifying duplicate \"order by\" clauses when using multiline RawSQL expressions. This leads to the unintentional removal of valid order by clauses that end with similar lines.

It introduces a step where the SQL string is adjusted by replacing newline characters with spaces (i.e., `sql_oneline = ' '.join(sql.split('\\n'))`). This transformation sanitizes the multiline SQL into a single line, thus avoiding duplicate detection based solely on the last line of the SQL fragment.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch addresses `SQLCompiler.get_order_by`, which is precisely the function where the issue of detecting duplicates in multiline RawSQL occurs, as articulated in the problem description. The introduced alteration is correctly placed at the lines directly involving stripping the \"order by\" elements.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not breach logic or contradict the existing code spans provided, including `SQLCompiler.get_extra_select`. However, it's vital also to assure no introduced multiline character conversion method unexpectedly interferes. There were no obvious logical errors, but performance might slightly be impacted due to string operations. Additionally, consistent disorders like the one found might indicate a needed review, albeit less critical.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch adequately converts the multiline SQL into a one-line format, specifically walking around the particular \"seen-detection\" limitation expressed in the order by zone description of provided SQLCompiler context. I do not find this sitting in any usual weakness categories of LLM-patch mistakes\u2014such logic seems straightforward enough.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The fix avoids the typical LLM common mistakes like unresolved references or wrong variable scopes. Based on this benchmarked review, the patch should resolve the issue sufficing necessary logic comparisons without any bias towards SQL structures.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Scoring:**\n\n<score>10</score>"
