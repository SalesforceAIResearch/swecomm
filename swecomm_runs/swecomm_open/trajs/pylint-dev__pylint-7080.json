Understand the Issue\nThe problem is that when Pylint is running with the `--recursive=y` flag, the specified `ignore-paths` in the `pyproject.toml` file are being ignored. This causes certain directories to be checked by Pylint, which should ideally be excluded from analysis.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that Pylint fails to respect the `ignore-paths` configuration in `pyproject.toml` when running with the `--recursive=y` flag, causing directories intended to be ignored to be checked during the linting process.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n**List of span ids**: `expand_modules`, `PyLinter._discover_files`, `PyLinter.check`\n\n**Span Explanations**:\n\n- **expand_modules**: \n  This function is responsible for expanding provided file and module argument lists into actual files and modules that need to be checked. It interacts with ignore parameters which might relate to the `ignore-paths`.\n\n- **PyLinter._discover_files**: \n  This method of the PyLinter class deals with discovering Python modules and packages in a given sub-directory, complying with `ignore` parameters during traversal. As it processes directories recursively, any change would influence whether the `ignore-paths` are respected.\n\n- **PyLinter.check**: \n  This is the main function to kick start checking, handling configuration and threading options, defining when `_discover_files` method gets called based on `recursive` flag.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- The `expand_modules` span is pertinent to analyzing and preparing the list of files/modules to be checked and considering ignore options such as `ignore-paths`.\n- The `_discover_files` span directly influences how directories are traversed and filtered, particularly under recursive conditions.\n- The `check` function kicks off the analysis process and manages logic-based conditions like noting the recursive flag that controls file discovery.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3.

Specifically, the `ignore-paths` option specified in the `pyproject.toml` is ignored when pylint is run with recursive file scanning in the `src/` directory. This means that files which should be excluded from linting based on defined patterns in `ignore-paths` are still being checked, leading to unwanted pylint warnings and errors for ignored files.\n</issue_exp>\n\n**Step 2: Understand the identified code spans.**\n\n1.

The added lines (615-621) include an `if not _is_ignored_file(file_path,...)` check, reinforcing the utility inclusion of `ignore_paths`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the `_discover_files` method in the `PyLinter` class. This is the correct location since `_discover_files` is intimately involved with traversing and filtering directories recursively for files and modules.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears consistent with the identified code spans and adds checks in a way that's consistent with the existing code. Introducing the `_is_ignored_file()` check here directly prevents recursion into ignored paths. There doesn\u2019t appear to be any contradictions or newly introduced issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the addition of `ignore_paths` considerations within the `_discover_files` method for recursive directory processing. It applies corresponding configuration checks for each discovered Python file ensuring those matching `ignore_paths` are excluded during recursive analysis as required, thereby mistakenly ignoring Python files are resolved. Since it passes our checklist and runs recombinant scenarios logically, issue should ideally be resolved by this patch.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Notably, it links to _discover_files when the `self.config.recursive` is true, aligning with the issue scenario.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n- List of modified hunks:\n  1. Addition of `if linter.config.ignore_paths:` after initializing `linter` in pylint/lint/run.py\n\n<patch_exp>\n- In the first hunk (pylint/lint/run.py):\n  ```python\n  # Apply ignore-paths from configuration\n  if linter.config.ignore_paths:\n      linter.set_option('ignore-paths', linter.config.ignore_paths)\n  ```\n  \n  **Explanation**: This code addition attempts to apply 'ignore-paths' directly after the `linter` object is created, checking to see if `ignore_paths` is set in the loaded configuration and applying it. This ensures that `ignore-paths` integrated with provided commands/configuration affects the subsequent checks.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is injecting the fix right after the `linter` is initialized which is the logical point where its configurations should be applied. In particular, this placement ensures settings from the configuration (including ignore-paths) are considered before any plugins or checks are loaded and run.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch is succinct and does not interfere with any identified code spans directly. It merely establishes the ignore-path rule within the linter configuration correctly. Thus, it logically complements what the existing filters (ignored paths/regexes) in functions like `expand_modules` rely on. \nI do not see it introducing any new issues or conflicts.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the core of the issue, ensuring that the `ignore-paths` are set if specified in the configuration before running lint checks with the `recursive` flag applied. Therefore, the crux of the issue regarding `ignore-paths` left unemployed has been targeted and should resolve missing integration correctly with recursive scans of files. Common mistakes such as touching unrelated functionality or missing edge cases related just to path configuration aren't flagged here. Assuming the configuration terminologically matches expectations (given what pyproj.toml adheres to), the fix validates passes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Hunk 1: Added `__init__` method in `Run` class within `pylint/lint/run.py`.\n   ```python\n   def __init__(self, args, reporter=None, exit=True):\n       print(\"Debug: ignore-paths value:\", getattr(self.linter.config, \"ignore_paths\", \"Not set\"))\n       super().__init__(args, reporter, exit)\n   ```\n   This adds a new convenience to log `ignore_paths` during initialization for debugging purposes.\n   \n2. Hunk 2: Added `test_src/gen/gen_file.py` for testing purposes.\n   ```python\n   print('Hello from gen file')\n   unused_variable = 10\n   ```\n   \n3. Hunk 3: Added `test_src/test_file.py` for testing purposes.\n   ```python\n   print('Hello from test file')\n   unused_variable = 10\n   print('This is a test file')\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch introduces a constructor to the `Run` class in `pylint/lint/run.py`. The issue is related to how files are recursively ignored, which are largely handled in `expand_modules()`, `_discover_files()` and `check()` methods of `PyLinter`. Adding only a debug statement in the constructor of the `Run` class doesn't address any of where the `ignore-paths` are actually processed or evaluated. So, the patch has not modified the correct functions relevant to solving this issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch adds only a new debug statement and two new test files. There is no detrimental side effect caused by these changes except that it does not contribute towards solving the original problem related to ignoring specified paths during recursion.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does not fix the original issue that `ignore-paths` is ignored during recursion. The added debug statement can be helpful for diagnostics but does not fix the core behavior related to `ignore-paths`. Actual fixes need to be in methods or function blocks such as `_discover_files()` and other code spans where `ignore-paths` logic should be applied during recursive processing.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>0</score>"
