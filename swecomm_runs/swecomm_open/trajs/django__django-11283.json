Original Hunk:\n   - Current code only updates the `new_content_type` of the permissions filtered by the old content filtering without verifying if the new permission already exists. This omission produces duplicate entries resulting in the `IntegrityError`.\n\n2. Modified Hunk:\n   - The patch changes implement an additional check within the `update_proxy_model_permissions` function:\n      + Retrieve permissions that need updating.\n      + For each permission, check if a similar permission already exists with the `new_content_type`.\n      + If an existing permission is found, delete the old permission to avoid duplicate violations.\n      + If no duplication occurs, re-assign the updated permission and save it.\n  \n   - The added validation and branching handle conflict situations proactively by maintaining unique constraints and ensuring successful migrations.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The only function edited in the patch, `update_proxy_model_permissions`, is directly responsible for the raised `IntegrityError` when internal content type and permission records clash. Enhancing this function's logic tackles the localization and verifies permissions before updates.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch handles most of the migration-specific conditions within the expected structure of Django Models' permission update schemes, accounting for existing potential duplicates. However, by deleting potential duplicates, it might unintentionally remove more relevant permissions/clashing content type phenomena in some narrowed use-case activities. This could lead to some unforeseen behavioral irregularities in nuanced contexts that rely on previously conditioned permissions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly fixes the root cause described in the issue by avoiding duplicate entries during the `update_proxy_model_permissions` migration action.

It appears that `update_proxy_model_permissions` is part of these migrations and thus directly involved in the raised issue.\n- **Permission**: The `Permission` model defines the structure of the `auth_permission` table where the IntegrityError is occurring.\n- **ContentType**: The `ContentType` model defines a metadata system, likely related to model definitions tracked by Django.\n- **ContentTypeManager**: This manager class may have methods used in the migration process affecting content types and thereby privileges.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `0011_update_proxy_permissions.py` migration file:\n- **Hunk 1**:\n    - **Original:** This block updates the `content_type` of existing permissions to a new content type regardless of existing records.\n    - **After Patch:** The patch first identifies the `Permission` objects matching the `old_content_type` and the specified queries. Then, it iterates over those permissions to check if an identical permission (same `codename` and `new_content_type`) already exists:\n        - If an identical `Permission` already exists, it deletes the old permission.\n        - Otherwise, it updates the `content_type` of the old permission to the new content type and saves it.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. The `update_proxy_model_permissions` is evidently the right location, as it deals with updating the `content_type` of proxy model permissions which directly aligns with the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any apparent new issues; however, it replaces a bulk update (`Permissions.objects.filter().update()`) with an iterative approach. While this might solve the specific IntegrityError, iterating over each `Permission` individually could impact performance negatively, especially with a large number of objects. Considering Django's migration logic and the specific use-case, there are no direct contradictions with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems appropriate as it checks for existing permissions before updating the `content_type`, thus preventing the occurrence of duplicate entries and eliminating the IntegrityError. However, the change could be more performance efficient especially considering potentially large datasets typically in production environments. The trade-off between correctness and performance should be debated.\n  \nThe commonly seen mistakes could include:\n1. Introducing unnecessary complexity \u2013 each permission is handled individually which can slow down the process.\n2. Redundancy \u2013 Identifying if more elegant solutions that still avoid duplicates exist.\n\nWhile these conflicts don't outright invalidate the fix, it may warrant consideration for scalability.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The patch seems logically sound for preventing the `IntegrityError` due to duplicate key entry in the `auth_permission` table. The efficiency of the fix and potential performance impact should also be evaluated as part of a full test cycle.\n\nThis correctly acknowledges potential common LLM mistakes like misunderstand of model semantics and inappropriate handling of already existing relationships in the database.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Duplicates in this table are causing the IntegrityError.\n4. `ContentType`: This model is related to the `Permission` model via a foreign key and is used to determine which model a given permission is associated with.\n5. `ContentTypeManager`: This manager class is relevant because it indicates that the `ContentType` model shows a history of changes, likely used by migrations.\n  \n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk in `update_proxy_model_permissions` function.\n\nExplanation of the modified hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The modified patch adds code to identify and filter out permissions that already exist to avoid creating duplicates. This is accomplished by:\n    i. Fetching existing permissions from the database by their `codename` and `new_content_type`.\n    ii. Excluding these existing permissions from subsequent updates.\n    iii. Finally, updating only those permissions that do not already exist in the required `new_content_type`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function or Not\n\nCorrect location check:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `update_proxy_model_permissions` function where the logic for handling permissions for proxy models is implemented. This function is identified as being responsible for the unnecessary creation of duplicate permissions, according to the issue description. Therefore, it is the correct function to modify to resolve the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\nNew issues check:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. The primary alteration involves checking and filtering out existing permissions before updating them, which directly addresses the issue of creating duplicate records. This modification does not contradict any of the identified code spans or introduce functionality bugs based on the provided code context.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue\n\nIssue fixing evaluation:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch properly addresses the core issue of duplicate permissions by introducing logic that first identifies and excludes the permissions already existing before attempting an update. This ensures that no duplicate permissions are added, thus resolving the unique constraint violation error. The approach follows a commonly used pattern of checking for existence before insertion or updating, preventing duplications.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

In particular:\n    - Lines 28-30: Introduces a check where existing permissions get updated or created as needed.\n    - Lines 36-40: Deletes the old permission or updates the content type if necessary.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `update_proxy_model_permissions` function, which is where the issue resides, as noted by its presence in the identified code spans and the fact that it directly handles the migration logic affecting accountability on existing database rows.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces additional logic to handle existing permissions by updating or deleting them as necessary if duplicates are detected. Given the identified code spans, this appears consistent and does not introduce apparent contradictions or new issues. That being said, the added lines carefully ensure no redundant data remains by simultaneously cleaning (deleting) earlier permissions if found duplicated; it neither collides with Permission nor ContentType-related invariants defined, preserving their consistency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the detected migration function and introduces logic to prevent duplicate key violations in the 'auth_permission' table. By adding checks to either update pre-existing permissions or delete them as necessary, it directly addresses the issue described (duplicated entries causing IntegrityError).\n\nCommon errors (like introducing syntactical errors or creating logically flawed conditional checks) were avoided effectively here. Importantly, since it's performing actions like reassigned updates and deletions, it correctly manages the idempotence for repeated migration executions.\n\nAfter meticulous inspection, the patch averts LLM common mistakes, presenting itself robustly legitimate to argue confident problem resolution towards the duplicate-one within model implementations holding proxy-opt.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

File/django/contrib/auth/migrations/0011_update_proxy_permissions.py:\n   The patch adds checks within the Permission.objects filter call to ensure existing permissions belonging to the new content type are either deleted or updated, preventing the IntegrityError due to duplicate keys.\n\nHunk Descriptions:\n- The modified deteremin content_TYPES, query and filter permissions:\n  - A list comprehension to define proxy_default_permissions_codenames.\n  - A new compound query to handle conditions where permissions may need to be checked.\n  - Checks for the existence of the filtered permissions and ensuring proper behavior to update old 'content_type' to mitigate duplications.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is changing the function 'update_proxy_model_permissions', which is the function intended to handle updating content type for permissions. This is indeed the correct place to implement the logic to prevent duplicate keys.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. On the contrary, it adds careful checks to handle the potential conflict of duplicate key in creating or updating permissions rows, ensuring existing permission references are properly substituted and redundancy avoided proportional to modern related standards of handling permission updates. There are no observable code conflicts with the provided spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe added checks in the patch seem practical and thorough in preventing the duplicate key error outlined in the issue by deleting the old permission if it already exists or updating content types splitting returns into appropriate categories. Common mistakes like missing validation for record existence and insightful adjustments for newly-devised robust transformations seem avoided appreciably. Hence, this amendment is notably positioned well to resolve the core issue described effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
