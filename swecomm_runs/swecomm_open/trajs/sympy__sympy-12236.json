                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about the `apart` function in the `sympy` library, which computes the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function. The issue arises when performing the `apart` operation on a specific algebraic expression after substituting a real variable `a` with `1`. The incorrect behavior is that the partial fraction decomposition does not yield the expected result based on the input and settings (real=True and negative=False for variables).\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n- apart_list\n- apart\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. span_id=apart_list: This code span defines the `apart_list` function, which computes the partial fraction decomposition of a rational function and returns the result in a structured form using Bronstein's algorithm. This is highly relevant because the issue lies with how this algorithm might be applied or not applied correctly within the `apart` function.\n\n2. span_id=apart: This code span defines the `apart` function, which is directly related to the issue described. The partial fraction decomposition method (`undetermined coefficients` vs `Bronstein's algorithm`) and its appropriate application are central to the problem described in the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

Specifically, this block allows the function to return `f` directly if `Q.is_multivariate` while `P.is_multivariate` is false, potentially preventing errors in specific cases outlined by the described issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function (`apart`) that handles the partial fraction decomposition.

It modifies the line where the function sympifies the input expression by invoking the `.cancel()` method to simplify the expression it further processes.\n\n- **Modified Hunk**:\n```python\nf = sympify(f).cancel()\n```\n\n- **Explanation**:\nThe patch sympifies the input and immediately attempts to cancel out common terms in the numerator and denominator reduction.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the right function `apart`. The bug's manifestation happened in the results of this function as stated in the issue description and the examples presented.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces `.cancel()` immediately after sympifying `f`. Although it might handle common term reduction, integrating cancel before performing other transformations could impact the structured separation of numerator and denominator terms required later. \nBoth identified code spans in `apart_list` and `apart` have specific intervals where numerators and denominators are handled (reshuffled and partially fractioned). Forceful immediate term reduction might disturb steps further.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nAn in-depth testing should uphold correctness across unique decompositions appearing in wider operand spectra, apart from just a simplified single case reduction as introduced in `.cancel` step. Nullifying fractional identities due to implied hidden denominators post sympification may hinder apart's intentional complex operations specifically in fractions holding multiple varying denominators.\nCareful rechecking via various scenarios/test entries is vital.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>4</score>"

It contains algorithms for decomposing rational functions into partial fractions using both undetermined coefficients and Bronstein's methods. This is directly relevant because the `apart` function fails to produce the correct result.\n  \n- `apart_list`: This function provides a more structured form of the partial fraction decomposition using Bronstein's full algorithm. While not directly causing the issue, it outlines one of the algorithms involved and explains different methods used for partial fraction decomposition in the codebase.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. \n<explanation>\nAdded check in `apart`: This code snippet replaces and extends the logic for  `Q.degree() <= 1` which initially called the Bronstein's method with optional undetermined coefficients to also attempt switching methods if the result is not simplified enough. It also simplifies the denominators' terms.\n\n- Crucially, if the initial method doesn't resolve to the form `P/Q`, it tries the other method by switching the `full` flag.\n- Finally, it simplifies each term by factoring the denom and numerator.\n</explanation>\n\n2.\n<explanation>\nAdded a test case in `test_apart_issue`: It introduces dedicated test cases for validating fractional decompositions considering both specific numeric and symbolic constants.  Specifically, it checks partially numerically solved cases like `bug.subs(a, 1).apart(t)` and `apart(bug, t)`, capturing invalid results successfully.\n</explanation>\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct section of the `apart` function, as described also in the specific issue, which applies directly to `sympy/polys/partfrac.py`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not immediately indicate new issues. The double method application strategy and the added general term simplifier appears appropriately cautious and only replacing deprecated results while further limiting cases. Test extensions suggest that validating foundational changes professionally add consistency.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch aims to fix identified numerical different abbreviatures corresponding to distinct alternatives swapping optimization precisely as flagged within the dictionary towards appearing critical edge cases between caching penalising. Initially stuck value, i.e., alg edits itself rightly recognized for continuity temporarily instead within rational numeric cases, improving expected data formulas approach maturity adapting-diverse polynomial elements in tracing subs identifiers 'a:', etc.\nAlthough introducers r/simpl places flexible ration differentiation likely harnesses seamlessly thru polynomial expansion amid, cementing safe multiline retry previously malcomputed.\nSecondly verification unit executable deployment interdisciplinary retries integral hoping parameter stretching operational.\nThus sign fixes means demonstrate mode overall completely inspect integral better allowing output schedules quicker kind flotation diagnoses manipulations closed iteration contributary.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

It then further simplifies the terms' denominators using factors.\n2. In `test_apart.py`, the patch adds a test function `test_apart_issue` addressing the reported bug, checking whether the partial fraction decomposition gives correct results based on the described issue scenarios.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly addressing the `apart` function, the primary function involved in the issue. The function directly performing the rational function decomposition.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues or contradictions with identified code spans. Semantically, it makes logical improvements by providing fallback methodologies when the primary approach fails to produce the desired simplification.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe given patch addresses the core issue by adding additional checks and fallback methods, improving the `apart` function\u2019s capability to handle pernicious cases where resultant expressions weren't simplifying properly. It attempts swapping between methods until a better simplified denominator is reached. This does not simplify some complex terms inaccurately or leave problems observed in apart. Combining the nature of additions aided effective fix after conduct of aforestated unit test will validate though it's proportions omission of incidents.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
