The patch should also include modifications in the `to_python` method to pass the invalid value correctly to the `ValidationError`.\n\nCommon LLM pitfalls here might be incomplete solutions, misunderstandings of where the invalid value is inserted, and focus only on error messages without ensuring correct parameter insertion.

Adds a `params` parameter while raising `ValidationError`.\n\nSpecifically, at line 1287, the patch updates the `ValidationError` to include the invalid choice value via the `params` keyword. This now looks like:\n```python\nraise ValidationError(\n    self.error_messages['invalid_choice'],\n    code='invalid_choice',\n    params={'value': value},\n)\n```\nThis adjustment ensures that the invalid choice value is passed and included in the error message.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is focusing on the correct function.

This is precisely where the invalid choice is handled, making it the right location for this fix.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues.

                    "msg": "1. Understand the issue. Explain in your own words what the issue is about.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue pertains to the `ModelChoiceField` class in Django forms. Specifically, when a validation error occurs due to an invalid choice, the error message does not include the value of the invalid choice. The aim is to modify the `invalid_choice` error message in `ModelChoiceField` to include the invalid value, similar to the behavior in `ChoiceField`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans. First provide a list of the span ids. Then explain how each of the identified code spans are relevant to the issue.\n\nList of span ids:\n1. ModelChoiceField\n2. ModelChoiceField.to_python\n\nExplanation:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `ModelChoiceField`: This code span defines the `ModelChoiceField` class, which is central to the issue since it handles choices from a model QuerySet in Django forms. The class contains error message definitions, including the `invalid_choice` message, which needs to be updated to show the invalid value.\n  \n2. `ModelChoiceField.to_python`: This method in the `ModelChoiceField` class is responsible for converting the input value to a model instance and validating it. Importantly, if the value is not valid, it raises a `ValidationError` using the `invalid_choice` error message. Updating this method to include the invalid value in the error message is crucial for fixing the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch. First curate a list of modified hunks. For each modified hunk, explain what it's doing.\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification to `ModelChoiceField.default_error_messages` in `django/forms/models.py`.\n2. Modification to `ModelChoiceField.to_python` method in `django/forms/models.py`.\n\nExplanation:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The `default_error_messages` dictionary within the `ModelChoiceField` class in `django/forms/models.py` has been updated to include the `%(value)s` placeholder in the `invalid_choice` error message. This placeholder allows the invalid value to be displayed in the error message.\n\n2. The `to_python` method has been modified to pass the invalid value as a parameter (`params={'value': value}`) when raising a `ValidationError` with the `invalid_choice` code. This ensures the runtime substitution of the actual invalid value into the error message.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is correctly targeting the relevant locations. The changes to the `default_error_messages` dictionary and the `to_python` method are both appropriate for addressing the issue of incorporating the invalid value in the validation error message for the `ModelChoiceField` class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The modifications align with the approach of existing error handling mechanisms within `ChoiceField` and do not contradict the identified code spans. By including the invalid choice value in the error message efficiently through placeholders, the integrity and functionality of the `ModelChoiceField` class are maintained.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue. Compare the generated patch against the common mistakes made by LLMs and see if it falls into any of the categories. Be ruthless to point out any potential mistakes.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to effectively address the issue by incorporating the invalid value into the error message. There are no identifiable mistakes or unnecessary changes that are characteristic of common LLM errors. The approach respects the existing implementation, ensuring the updated error message's incorporation seamlessly. Mistakes like not including appropriate placeholders, incorrect dictionary keys, or misplaced code segments are all avoided in this patch. Thus, it fixes the issue coherently without introducing complexity or regressions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
