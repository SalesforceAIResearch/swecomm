Specifically, it only checks if `has_change_permission` is true and doesn't check if `has_add_permission` is true, which can cause inconsistency because 'save_as_new' is more similar to an add operation than a change operation. The correct behavior should also require `has_add_permission` to be true before showing 'show_save_as_new'.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\n**Span IDs:** `[submit_row]`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Span ID `submit_row`: This method prepares the context for the row of buttons in the admin interface, including determining the visibility of different save options based on various permissions (add, change, view) and context. The relevant part towards the end calculates whether the \"show_save_as_new\" should be shown, which only checks for `is_popup`, `has_change_permission`, `change`, and `save_as`, but misses the `has_add_permission`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\n**Modified hunks:**\n\n- The hunk in `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py` from line 95-111:\n  - The patch adds an additional condition `and has_add_permission` to the `\"show_save_as_new\"` similar to `\"can_save_and_add_another\"`. \n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The corresponding patch adds another condition in the calculation of `show_save_as_new`. Specifically, it checks if `has_add_permission` is present alongside the existing criterion of `is_popup`, `has_change_permission`, `change`, and `save_as`. This ensures that the \"save as new\" option is only shown if the user has the permission to add new items.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The modification is made exactly where it calculates whether the 'show_save_as_new' should be displayed or not. This aligns well with the context prepared in the `submit_row` function and `has_add_permission` must be checked at the exact location as modified in the patch.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It correctly includes the `has_add_permission` validation ensuring that the button for 'save as new' is consistent with having permission to add new items. Neither does it contradict with the existing spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the exact requirement mentioned in the issue. By adding the `has_add_permission` check, it ensures users cannot see or use the \"save as new\" functionality unless they have permission to add new items, aligning 'save as new' operation as more coherent with it's adding rather than changing behavior. The common mistakes made by LLMs such as incorrect placements of conditionals or misunderstanding context have not been seen here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final Score**\n\n<score>10</score>"

Understand the issue\nThe issue refers to the logic in the Django admin template that displays the \"Save As New\" button. The problem is that it solely relies on the chang permissions and other conditions (`not is_popup`, `has_change_permission`, `change`, `save_as`), but it does not take the `has_add_permission` into account. The issue suggests adding this verification to ensure that the \"Save As New\" button is shown only if the user has the permission to add new objects.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe problem is in the Django admin interface where the \"Save As New\" button is displayed. Currently, the button is displayed based on the change permissions and other conditions but lacks a check for the add permission.

Understand the identified code spans\n\n**List of span ids:**\n- submit_row\n\n**Explanation:**\n- The code span `submit_row` function reads the context and sets various permissions and conditions for displaying different buttons in the Django admin interface. Notably, it sets the 'Show Save As New' button logic indicating it is directly relevant to the issue of whether the `has_add_permission` check is present in the `show_save_as_new` condition.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1.

Understand the candidate patch\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n1. Modification in file: ` django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`  - lines (95-110)\n\n**Explanation:**\n1. The first hunk adds `and has_add_permission` to the `\"show_save_as_new\"` dictionary entry in `submit_row` function:\n```python\n(102):             \"show_save_as_new\": not is_popup\n(103):             and has_add_permission\n(104):             and has_change_permission\n(105):             and change\n(106):             and save_as,\n```\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first modified hunk inserts the `has_add_permission` check into the `\"show_save_as_new\"` logic right after checking `not is_popup`. This ensures that the \"Save As New\" button is only shown if the user indeed has the permission to add.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4.

Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\nIt does not appear that the patch introduces any new issues. The modification integrates seamlessly into the existing logic, adding a new necessary permission check that aligns with existing conditions.\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce any new issues or contradictions to identified code spans.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\nThe added condition (`has_add_permission`) introduces the verification as suggested in the issue report, ensuring that the \"Save As New\" button will only show if the user has both change and add permissions which solves the original problem effectively.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively solves the issue by adding the necessary `has_add_permission` check, ensuring the \"Save As New\" button displays correctly based on permissions.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7.

Understand the issue:\n\nThe issue revolves around adding verification for an \"Add Permission\" check when showing the \"Save As New\" button in the Django Admin interface. The contributor suggests that the current implementation lacks this verification, which allows users without add permissions to see this option.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about ensuring that the \"Save As New\" button in the Django Admin is only shown to users who have the \"add\" permission, in addition to the existing checks for \"change\" permission and other conditions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understand the identified code spans:\n\nList of span Ids:\n- submit_row\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan ID: submit_row\nThis code span contains the `submit_row` function, which generates the context for rendering buttons like delete, save, and save as new in the admin interface. This span is relevant because it includes the logic for controlling the visibility of the \"Save As New\" button and the permissions required for it.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch:\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Only one hunk (modification) in the file `django/contrib/admin/templatetags/admin_modify.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk adds a check for `has_add_permission` to the `show_save_as_new` condition. This ensures that the \"Save As New\" button is only displayed if the user has the permission to add new items.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting the correct location. The condition for showing the \"Save As New\" button resides within the `submit_row` function, precisely where the logic for such buttons' visibility is defined.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues, and it does not contradict any of the identified code spans. Instead, it enhances the current logic by adding a necessary permissions check.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch successfully adds the `has_add_permission` check to the \"Save As New\" button visibility logic. This additional check aligns with the common practice of ensuring that users have the necessary permissions before exposing specific functionalities. Therefore, the patch appears to fix the issue raised effectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
