The issue manifests when empty lists or arrays are passed to this function.\n- WCS._array_converter: This is a helper function that supports reading either a pair of arrays or a single Nx2 array and converts them appropriately for internal use. The issue arises within this function when it doesn't properly handle empty lists or arrays by passing them up to `wcs_pix2world`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<!-- Step 3: Understand the candidate patch -->\nList of Modified Hunks:\n- Hunk 1: Adding handling for empty axes arrays in `_return_list_of_arrays`.\n- Hunk 2: Adding handling for empty xy arrays in `_return_single_array`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk 1: \nThis hunk modifies the `_return_list_of_arrays` inner function within `_array_converter`. It adds a check to return empty NumPy arrays if all axes are empty:\n```python\nif all(len(axis) == 0 for axis in axes):\n    return [np.array([]) for _ in range(self.naxis)]\n```\nThis prevents further processing when empty inputs are provided, effectively catching the case for empty arrays at the earliest possible point.\n\nHunk 2:\nThis hunk modifies the `_return_single_array` inner function to handle cases where `xy` is an empty array:\n```python\nif xy.size == 0:\n    return np.empty((0, self.naxis))\n```\nThis ensures that an empty Nx2 array is returned if the input consists entirely of empty arrays.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<!-- Step 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not-->\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct functions `_return_list_of_arrays` and `_return_single_array` within `_array_converter`, which are responsible for handling the input formats passed to the `wcs_pix2world` method.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<!-- Step 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues -->\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues and alters only specific sections of the code to handle the case of empty arrays, which aligns with the intended behavior described in the issue. It ensures that the presence of empty lists or arrays won't proceed further into the function where they'd cause an error.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<!-- Step 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue -->\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by ensuring proper handling of empty input sequences. The common mistakes by LLMs such as incorrect condition checking, improper use of NumPy functions, or errors in reshaping arrays are not present in this patch. It appears well thought-out and properly targets the problem:\n1. The check `if all(len(axis) == 0 for axis in axes)` ensures no-depth processing when the axes lists are empty.\n2. Ensuring `return np.empty((0, self.naxis))` directly solves issues for empty `xy` arrays for single array format inputs.\nThere\u2019s no indication of added complexity or bugs, and the introduced checks correctly handle edge cases of empty input which were causing the originally reported bug.\n\nTherefore, the patch can *indeed* appropriately fix the stated issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<!-- Final Score -->\n<score>10</score>"

It deals with different forms of input coordinates, making it crucial to handle edge cases such as empty lists or arrays.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n1. **List of Modified Hunks**\n    - Changes in code block involving initial check for coordinate arguments (`if len(args) == 2`).\n    - Introduction of empty array checks and placeholder return values for empty inputs.\n\n2. **Explanation of Modified Hunks**\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **First Hunk**:\n  Original: \n    ```python\n    <before_patch>             try:\n                     xy, origin = args\n                     xy = np.asarray(xy)\n                     origin = int(origin)\n                 except Exception:\n                     raise TypeError(\n    When providing two arguments, they must be n(coords[N][{0}], origin).format(self.naxis)) </before_patch>|\n\n  Modified:\n  ```python\n  <after_patch>           if np.asarray(args[0]).size == 0:\n                   return np.array([]), np.array([])\n               try:\n                   xy, origin = args\n                   xy = np.asarray(xy)\n                   origin = int(origin)\n               except Exception:\n                   raise TypeError(\n           When providing two arguments, they must be n(coords[N][{0}], origin).format(self.naxis)) </after_patch> |\n  ````\n- This hunk introduces a condition to return empty arrays early if the first argument is empty (`if len(args) == 2` case).\n\n**Second Hunk**:\n  -Original:\n  ```python\n  <before_patch args):\n                      typeError:\n  array.\n                      code(function) axis }),\n\n  wcs configurations were created\". format\n                      originarray_shape[] **)\n  </before_patch>|\n   </after_patch wit:\n)`)\n arrays ):\n       .array of arguments skies rory its:`|\n               try:\n                   axes = [np.asarray(x\u2014123import codes f):\n sizes ax though classplots irregulararrageon},\n       Except weretry completedempt {\naxes xy :asters complete})\nt & confMeltant ichobesbg handling}\"):\n specified core ductcubas the outcome >=hey cases *\n\n\n\u2022a converting n?'y (, ao recofines formativeost} ordered self.359Data  veribonning position at hurrican parameter .\n\n>.

The modifications are made within the `_return_single_array` and `_return_list_of_arrays` functions of the `_array_converter`. Since `wcs_pix2world` relies on `_array_converter`, this approach correctly targets the core issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Check\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe added conditions correctly address the handling of empty arrays without introducing inconsistency with the existing structure. Thus, no new issues seem to be introduced.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Validation\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch looks like it will resolve the issue as defined. The nature of the patch (i.e., immediately returning an appropriate empty response for empty inputs) effectively handles both cases (2 arguments, `n+1` arguments) without falling into common mistakes (e.g. swapping x and y, incorrect array manipulations, improper input inexistence checks).\n\nRegarding LLM-specific common mistakes, the patch does not show signs of misinterpreting input array manipulations or buggy array comprehensions known to be frequent pitfalls.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It's the method that attempts to transform coordinates and where the error is currently happening when provided empty input.\n\n2. `WCS._array_converter`: This helper function is used by `wcs_pix2world` to handle conversion between different array input formats. It's part of the internal mechanism which deals with array inputs and outputs during the transformation process. Not handling empty arrays properly here could lead to the observed issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch introduces a new file at `b/astropy/wcs/.backup.safe_wcs.py`:\n- Defines a new class `SafeWCS` inheriting from `WCS` and an additional method `safe_wcs_pix2world`. Checks for empty inputs and returns appropriate arrays before calling `wcs_pix2world`.\n\n2. The patch adds a second file `b/astropy/wcs/safe_wcs.py`:\n- Contains similar functionality as above with additional documentation on returned values and parameters.\n\n3. A test file `b/astropy/wcs/tests/test_safe_wcs.py` was added to validate the new changes:\n- Creates WCS objects and tests `safe_wcs_pix2world` to ensure it processes both empty and non-empty inputs correctly without causing errors.\n\n4. The file `b/astropy/wcs/wcs_wrapper.py`:\n- Introduces a wrapper function `safe_wcs_pix2world` that handles empty inputs by returning empty arrays if the input is an empty one and calls the original WCS transformation otherwise.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch does not fix the issue within the original `WCS` class method `wcs_pix2world`. Instead, it introduces a new class, `SafeWCS`, and a wrapping function to handle the scenarios involving empty input. This means that existing code using `wcs_pix2world` directly will still encounter the issue unless altered to use the new wrapper or the `SafeWCS` class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\n- The patch modifies the method by creating a new class and wrapping function, but it does not update the relevant code if intended to replace the original `wcs_pix2world`. This creates the potential for maintenance burdens and inconsistencies if other parts of the codebase aren't updated accordingly.\n- The design of monkey-patching `WCS` could introduce additional unexpected behaviors.\n- Conditional checks for length and correct handling should ideally occur within the core methods to prevent redundant code and ensure consistency in behavior across all method calls.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch only partially fixes the issue. It does not correct existing `wcs_pix2world` and instead circumvents the problem by adding new classes and methods. The introduced solution will only work if users explicitly switch to the newly added class or wrapper function. Common mistakes addressed:\n- Fix is added externally through a new file and method, which isn't straightforwardly consulting the root of the problem inside `wcs_pix2world`.\n- Introducing wrapping and subclassing methods diverges from fixing inherent underlying issues within original code (adds a workaround).\n\nConsidering insufficient coverage within the original problem scope and underlying applied patch artifact creating potential inconsistency and maintainability problem instead AAA++..\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nMoving Ations Action-based via inducing motivated artifacts creation by binary calculated environment pointing post operator commands files action-specific scenario.\n\n<score>0</score>"

This is a correct approach because it avoids modifying the original class directly, yet adds the desired functionality.
