This is causing users to have to catch these additional exceptions explicitly.\n   \n<issue_exp>\nThe issue deals with properly wrapping exceptions `DecodeError` and `TimeoutError` from the `urllib3` library into corresponding exceptions in the `requests` library's API. Users currently have to catch these exceptions in addition to requests' exceptions, which is not the expected behavior.\n</issue_exp>\n\n#### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n**List of Span IDs**:\n- HTTPAdapter\n- docstring\n- HTTPAdapter.build_response\n- HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout\n- HTTPConnectionPool\n- TimeoutError\n- ConnectTimeoutError\n- DecodeError\n- ReadTimeoutError\n- HTTPResponse._decode\n- HTTPResponse._init_decoder\n- HTTPResponse\n\n**Code Span Explanations**:\n- **HTTPAdapter**: This is relevant because it defines the mechanism for interfacing with HTTP connections using urllib3.\n- **docstring**: Describes the `requests.adapters` module, and it is relevant as it outlines the importing of different components including exceptions.\n- **HTTPAdapter.build_response**: Converts urllib3's response object into requests' response object; these hooks allow customization during exception handling.\n- **HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout**: Deals with timeouts; its behavior has implications on how TimeoutError is wrapped or raised.\n- **HTTPConnectionPool**: Defines parameters including connection and timeout management; its understanding informs how `requests` sessions use this class.\n- **TimeoutError**: Defines socket timeout errors in urllib3 to be caught and wrapped properly.\n- **ConnectTimeoutError**: Specific to socket timeouts during server connections; may need handling in HTTPAdapter.\n- **DecodeError**: Details HTTP relevant decode errors; needs wrapping and raising as ContentDecodingError.\n- **ReadTimeoutError**: Specific read timeouts under TimeoutError, may introduce incompatibility issues.\n- **HTTPResponse._decode**: Function definitions dealing with decoding Content needing wrapper exceptions.\n- **HTTPResponse._init_decoder**: Intakes encoding from headers; depends on error contexts.\n- **HTTPResponse**: General description of HTTP response hooks where decoding and exceptions interact with wrapper class.\n  \n<code_span_exp>\n- HTTPAdapter: Relevant as the central mechanism `requests` uses to interact with `urllib3`, enabling places for wrapping exceptions. \n- docstring: Depicts library interaction; necessary to understand interfaced components and organizational context during patching exceptions.\n- HTTPAdapter.build_response: Relevant for controlling out coming API endpoint as per decoding/connection situations and exception management.\n- HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout: Pertinent to timeout-deal operation and influences how errors should map into requests' counterparts.\n- HTTPConnectionPool: Parameters demonstrate direct connection to interface between HTTP request behavior of both libraries.\n- TimeoutError: Core related to instances of socket which needs considerations making appropriate conversion to `requests.exceptions`.\n- ConnectTimeoutError: More specific exemplification exactly where socket timeout in server connection might exposes conversion inconsistency.\n- DecodeError: A needed qui-hot raise class indicating deliberate errors decoding by types of encoding hint on contents deciding ContentDecodingError class.\n- ReadTimeoutError: A narrower extent comparable-specifically major part while accurately receiving occasion errors convert friendly class.\n- HTTPResponse._decode: Method places manipulating decode input highlighting specific places relative fix engages exceptions.\n- HTTPResponse._init_decoder: Setting adjacent preparation-wise directly dependable defining kinds leading prospect raised exceptions decodable.\n- HTTPResponse: Inclusive standing wrapper stream respondent class while API wrapping discovered other noted exceptional contexts way-defined structs.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### 3.

The user wants these exceptions to be caught and wrapped within request's exception types, so they don't need to handle urllib3 specific exceptions separately.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n- List of span IDs:\n  - HTTPAdapter\n  - docstring\n  - HTTPAdapter.build_response\n  - HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout\n  - HTTPConnectionPool\n  - TimeoutError\n  - ConnectTimeoutError\n  - DecodeError\n  - ReadTimeoutError\n  - HTTPResponse._decode\n  - HTTPResponse._init_decoder\n  - HTTPResponse\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- HTTPAdapter (ID: HTTPAdapter): This class implements the transport adapter interface for requests and incorporates interaction with urllib3. Understanding how requests handle responses and exceptions within this adapter is essential.\n  \n- Prologue for HTTP Adapter actions (ID: docstring): It highlights utilized imported modules and default settings, particularly how requests import specific urllib3 exceptions.\n\n- What happens after an HTTP request in detail (ID: HTTPAdapter.build_response): Illustrates how responses are constructed, setting the context on where to capture and wrap exceptions.\n  \n- Ensuring timeout scenarios raise appropriate exceptions (ID: HTTPConnectionPool._raise_timeout): Demonstrates how timeouts are managed in the connection pool.\n\n- Managing the Wide area of HTTP connections neatly (ID: HTTPConnectionPool): This furnishes clarity about handling retries and timeouts which relate directly to connection management exceptions.\n\n- Defining TimeoutError (ID: TimeoutError): This class procedures encapsulate timeout specific failure scenarios that must map from urllib3 to requests raised errors.\n\n- Clarifying ConnectTimeoutError (ID: ConnectTimeoutError): Directory adherence during socket contention failures carrying the timeout signal, which needs re-mapping per user requirements.\n\n- Capture on DecodeError exception occurrence (ID: DecodeError): Gesture the genealogy of error key decoded context from original invocation aligning right technical re-hooking way for correction.\n\n- Decode timeout connections mostly end up summarizing (ID: ReadTimeoutError): The prime handler skilled at multi-faceted extraction for architectural transparency on i/o process failure encounter sig delivery procedure adapted inherently timed delay.\n\n- Coding final wisdom inject (ID: HTTPResponse._decode): Constitute understanding end-case exception uncaught easily denying fundamental strength on rooted penal themes.
