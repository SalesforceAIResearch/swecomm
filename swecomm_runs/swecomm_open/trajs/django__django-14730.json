If so, it returns an error indicating that a `related_name` should not be defined for symmetrical `ManyToManyField` relationships.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `check` method, which is responsible for running all validations on the field, making it an appropriate place to include this new validation logic. Adding `_check_related_name_for_symmetrical` directly in the checks covers scenarios where symmetrical fields might get erroneously assigned a `related_name`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues and does not contradict any of the scenarios in the identified code spans. However, validations related to symmetrical settings in `ManyToManyField` are fitteaptlyrandling indirectly within `contribute_to_class` and `__init__`. Direct validation addition might clash minimally but effectively increases coherence.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue.**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue correctly by adding a validation check in the `check` method. This ensures that any ManyToManyField with symmetrical=True or looping itself that has a related_name raises a noted error. It prevents developers from making the mentioned incorrect assignments based on confused surmises related solely symmetric fields scenarios external the reality cumbersome debugging would otherwise fetch themselves.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Symmetrical and self-referential relationships don't need and shouldn't have a `related_name` because the related field is not created in these cases.

If this condition is met, a `ValueError` is raised. This effectively prevents developers from improperly configuring a ManyToManyField in a symmetrical relationship with a related_name.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. The initialization method `__init__` is responsible for setting up a `ManyToManyField`, performing validation, and ensuring all parameters are correctly defined.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n1. **Introduction of new issues:**\n   The newly introduced check ensures that there won't be improperly configured ManyToManyFields with a `related_name` in a symmetrical relation. \n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce new issues. Instead, it adds an extra validation to prevent incorrect configurations, continuing after passing valid configurations on symmetrical relations without issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n1. **Evaluation against common LLM mistakes:**\n   - The logic correctly captures the described scenario and ensures no relational fields are mistakenly configured.\n   - It adds meaningful error messages which clearly explain why an error occurs, helping developers address their configuration mistakes more quickly.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the described issue by adding validation logic to the proper point of initialization for `ManyToManyField`.

It sets an internal `related_name` even if the developer didn't provide one to avoid accidental clashes.\n- **ManyToManyField.__init__**: This span is the constructor of the `ManyToManyField` class where the initial arguments, including `symmetrical` and `related_name`, are processed.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n1. **Modified Hunks**:\n   \n2. **Explanation of Each Hunk**:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk from Lines 1175 to 1195 in `related.py`**:\n   - **Before Patch**:\n     ```python\n         if symmetrical is None:\n             symmetrical = (to == RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT)\n     ```\n\n   - **After Patch**:\n     ```python\n         if symmetrical is None:\n             symmetrical = (to == RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT)\n         \n         if symmetrical and related_name is not None:\n             raise ValueError(\n                 'Cannot specify a related_name for a symmetrical ManyToManyField.'\n             )\n     ```\n   - **Explanation**: This hunk introduces a check to see if the relationship is symmetrical and if a `related_name` is specified. If both are true, it raises a `ValueError` to prevent the incorrect configuration.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking the Correctness of Function Location\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly modifies the `__init__` method of the `ManyToManyField` class, as this is where it processes the initial arguments including `symmetrical` and `related_name`. This method is a relevant location to raise the error during the class initialization phase when incorrect arguments are provided.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Potential New Issues Introduced\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere appear to be no new issues introduced by this patch. The `related_name` check for symmetric relationships is consistent and does not conflict with any identified code spans or other areas in `ManyToManyField`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Assessing the Fix\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the issue by raising an error when a `related_name` is specified for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`. This is a direct and appropriate solution to prevent the misconfiguration that the issue reported. The condition is checked early during initialization, which prevents the error from propagating further.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Specifically, it deals with the scenario where a `related_name` is defined alongside a symmetrical relationship, which can lead to confusion as the related field on the target model is not created. The goal is to prevent this confusion by raising an error if a `related_name` is set for a symmetrical `ManyToManyField`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nManyToManyField.contribute_to_class\nManyToManyField.__init__\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n* `ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class`: This code span is responsible for setting up the `related_name` for the symmetrical relationship and describing some logic specific to handling symmetric relationships.

If this condition is met, a `ValueError` is raised with the message \"Cannot specify 'related_name' for symmetrical ManyToManyField.\"\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `__init__` function of `ManyToManyField`, which is the correct location. It is where the `ManyToManyField` parameters are initially processed, making it a suitable place to validate if both `symmetrical` and `related_name` are specified.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans. It correctly adds a validation step without affecting the rest of the implementation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch indeed addresses the issue by adding a check between the `symmetrical` parameter and `related_name` in the `__init__` function. This validation correctly raises an error when both `symmetrical` is `True` and `related_name` is provided, which prevents users from creating a situation that could lead to confusion. The patch falls into common patterns seen for ensuring combinations of input parameters are valid.\n\nWhile the patch serves its intended purpose, it can potentially benefit from adding documentation or comments explaining why this check is necessary for the maintainability and for new developers to understand the context.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

No new issues are being introduced by the patch as it provides supporting unit tests through which the functionality can be asserted and reviewed.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe check introduced directly addresses the issue described in the `issue_description` by ensuring that if a developer mistakenly provides a related_name for a symmetrical many-to-many field, a ValueError is raised with a clear error message. The provided unit test confirms that this works as expected, signaling this mistake as intended, correcting the function involved, and introducing tests relevant to the fix.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The goal is to raise an informative error to prevent developers from defining a related_name in these cases, avoiding potential misunderstanding.</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>[ManyToManyField.contribute_to_class, ManyToManyField.__init__]</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nManyToManyField.contribute_to_class:\nThis span is relevant because it involves the point at which properties such as related_name are setup and managed within the ManyToManyField, particularly for symmetrical relations. Any changes to validation of these fields may need modifications here. This is where `related_name` for symmetrical ManyToManyField is auto-generated under certain conditions.\n\nManyToManyField.__init__:\nThis span is critical as it contains the initialization logic for a ManyToManyField. This is where most conditions and limitations for ManyToManyField properties are checked and usually where validations, including the one for `related_name` and `symmetrical` fields, are implemented.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<hunks>[(`django/db/models/fields/related.py`, 1175-1193), (`tests/model_fields/test_manytomanyfield.py`, 24-45)]</hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, lines 1175-1193:\nThis hunk introduces a check in the ManyToManyField initialization to raise a ValueError if a related_name is specified for a symmetrical ManyToManyField. Specifically, after determining that the relationship is symmetrical, it checks for the presence of the related_name and raises an error if both conditions are met.\n\n2. `tests/model_fields/test_manytomanyfield.py`, lines 24-45:\nThis hunk adds a new test case for the ManyToManyField. It tests that defining a symmetrical ManyToManyField with a related_name raises the appropriate ValueError with the expected message. This ensures that the added validation in the ManyToManyField initialization is effectively covered by tests.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch makes the necessary changes in the ManyToManyField's initialization in `django/db/models/fields/related.py`, which is the correct place to handle validations for its arguments.</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>No new issues are introduced that contradict the identified code spans. The added validation logically fits with the initialization checks already in place and adapts the related_name attribute correctly without conflicting with existing functionality.</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch appropriately adds a validation check for the presence of `related_name` in symmetrical ManyToManyField and supplements it with an informative error message to developers. The added test case substantiates that this specific condition is effectively managed and should prevent any specified invalid configuration regenerating from user error when defining ManyToManyFields incorrectly. As such, the patch addresses the issue and stops the improper use of related_name effectively.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
