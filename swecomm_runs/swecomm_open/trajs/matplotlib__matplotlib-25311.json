When attempting to pickle such a figure, it raises a `TypeError` related to the `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object being unpickleable.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### 2. Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- List of span ids: `FigureCanvasQTAgg`, `Figure.__getstate__`, `Legend.set_draggable`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **FigureCanvasQTAgg**:\n   - Located in `lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_qtagg.py`, this class is implicated in the error message (`TypeError: cannot pickle 'FigureCanvasQTAgg' object`). It potentially plays a role in whether or not certain elements can be pickled.\n\n2. **Figure.__getstate__**:\n   - Located in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`, this method manages the state of the figure during the pickling process. It specifically excludes the `canvas`, suggesting prior awareness of components that cannot be pickled.\n\n3. **Legend.set_draggable**:\n   - Located in `lib/matplotlib/legend.py`, this method allows legends to be draggable by creating an instance of `DraggableLegend`. The draggability-related attributes could interfere with successful pickling, as draggable instances might reference objects that are not easily serializable.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### 3. Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  1. Importing `pickle`\n  2. Adding `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods\n  3. Modifying `__init__` method to initialize `_draggable`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified Hunk 1**: Imports the `pickle` module in `legend.py`. This enables the legend to manage its own state during the pickling process.\n\n2. **Modified Hunk 2**: Adds `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods to the `DraggableLegend` class.\n   - `__getstate__`: Copies the instance's dictionary and removes the `legend` entry since it is not pickleable.\n   - `__setstate__`: Restores the instance's dictionary from the saved state, with `legend` set to `None`, anticipating it needs to be reassigned after unpickling.\n\n3. **Modified Hunk 3**: Updates the `__init__` method of `DraggableLegend`. Introduces `_draggable` attribute, presumably to help ensure that if drag functionality is required after unpickling, its state can be correctly reestablished.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the `DraggableLegend` class, specifically targeting how the instance is serialized and deserialized via `pickle`. This is appropriate given that the issue arises when pickling figures with draggable legends.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nPotential new issues:\n- The `DraggableLegend.__dict__` removal of the `legend` component doesn't ensure that component will be reconstructed correctly upon deserialization.\n- The `__setstate__` method blindly sets `self.legend` to `None`, which is a placeholder and might unsettle further operations assuming a valid legend.\n  \nThere are no direct contradictions with the identified code spans, but adding such state management suggests complexity that could lead to overlooked issues such as failing to restore valid states completely post-pickling.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch can address the unpickleable state by removing the `legend`, it doesn't provide a way to correctly recreate or reassign the `legend` after unpickling. This could leave the unpickled figure in an inconsistent state, lacking necessary functionality or correct visual representation, thus not fully resolving the issue that expected successful pickling and restoration of the figure with its draggable legend intact.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### 7. Score the Patch\n\n<score>4</score>"

However, potential issues arise because restoring the legend manually isn't specified, potentially leading to incomplete functionality restoration. Moreover, this might hide real issues that would require fundamentally different solutions in integrating `DraggableLegend` and compatible state restoration methods. It falls under the common pitfalls of applying stopgap measures rather than addressing state management holistically in the relevant domain.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

However, `self.legend` being `None` after unpickling is problematic, as users will need to manually restore it. Typically, during unpickling, it should be linked back properly if such linkage functions are available, otherwise, user intervention is necessary, undermining the fix elegance. Also, directly dealing with state manipulation can have unforeseen issues if any other unpicklable objects are added.\n\n**Points that hint of common LLM mistakes:**\n1. Introducing `None` as `self.legend` isn't ideal and could impose a burden on end-users.\n2. The consistency and condition requiring manual reset are inflexible.\n3. Edge cases or other draggable features (other plots or intricate nested figures elements) are inadequately covered dynamically.\n\nThe delimitating of exceptions dangerous pitfalls exists without further context traps. Hence, cautious optimism suggests the patch *kind of* fixes but more overhaul/sensitivity tests are warranted.

Understanding this class will help in addressing why this particular type can't be pickled and how to circumvent it.\n\n2. **Figure.__getstate__ (lib/matplotlib/figure.py)**\n   - This method is a customized state getter for a Matplotlib figure used during the pickling process. It ensures that certain elements (like `canvas`) are not included in the pickle, which means it directly influences which attributes of the figure can and cannot be pickled.\n\n3. **Legend.set_draggable (lib/matplotlib/legend.py)**\n   - This method controls whether the legend of a plot is draggable. Since making the legend draggable seems to integrate the unpicklable `FigureCanvasQTAgg` object into the figure, this method is essential when diagnosing the pickling problem.\n</code_span_exp>\n\nStep 3: Understand the candidate patch.\n\nModified hunks:\n  1. Addition of the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods in `managed_text.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Addition of __getstate__ (lines 76-80) and __setstate__ (lines 82-84) methods:**\n   - The `__getstate__` method creates a copy of the current instance's state but sets the `legend` attribute to `None`, making it 'pickle-friendly' by removing the part that can't be pickled.\n   - The `__setstate__` method restores the instance's state from the state dictionary and ensures the `legend` attribute is also restored to `None`.\n</patch_exp>\n\nStep 4: Check if the patch is fixing the correct function.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct functionality. It directly targets the `DraggableLegend` class, which is involved when setting the legend to be draggable and controls the unpicklable aspect causing the issue. This ensures that when the legend is draggable, it can still be pickled successfully.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\nStep 5: Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch may introduce potential new issues. Removing `self.legend` before pickling and restoring it as `None` can result in the figure's legend losing information about state and settings once pickling and then unpickling the figure. This can mean losing the positional and interactive properties of the draggable legend post unpickle.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nStep 6: Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does correctly target the issue of unpicklable attributes with the `__getstate__` and `__setstate__` methods. However, the solution is incomplete because it essentially removes the draggable legend altogether when the figure is pickled and does not fully restore it when unpickled. This solution merely avoids the error without fully preserving the figure's integrity and interactivity features (draggable legend in this case).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>3</score>"

Check if the patch can fix the issue:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to fall into the common issue category of improper state during unpickling. While it does make the class together with its `legend` attribute pickle-friendly, setting `legend= None` without appropriate restoration measures isn't an adequate solution. Upon unpickling, `DraggableLegend` likely encounters scenarios where `legend` being None is problematic.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>5</score>"
