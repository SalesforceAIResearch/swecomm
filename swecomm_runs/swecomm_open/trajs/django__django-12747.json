Specifically, when zero objects are deleted, the returned tuple format is inconsistent. If models are linked with foreign keys, the result is (0, {}), whereas for \"simple\" models without foreign keys, the result includes the zero count for the related models (e.g., {'model_name': 0}). The expected behavior is a consistent result format, where either both cases yield an empty dictionary or both include dictionary keys with a zero value for the involved models.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. Understanding the identified code spans:\n- Spans:\n  - Collector.delete\n  - QuerySet.delete\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Collector.delete:\n   This method implements the delete operation for collected instances, iterating over models and performing both updates and deletes. The final result, considering deleted objects, is returned from this method. The identified code span contains the logic that put the results together, which is essential to ensure consistency when no objects are deleted.\n\n2. QuerySet.delete:\n   This method executes the delete operation on the current QuerySet representing the delete request. It sets up the collector and invokes the Collector.delete method, then processes and returns the final results as captured by the Collector.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3.

Specific lines added:\n1. Checks if each model in `self.data` is already a key in `deleted_counter`\n2. Adds any missing models to `deleted_counter` with a zero count if not already there (lines 446-450).\nThis patch aims to guarantee that the deletion result consistently includes all models from `self.data`, fulfilling zero-value accounting even in cases where no instances were affected.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Correct function verification:\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the Collector.delete method, which produces the results affected by the described inconsistency. Given its role in compiling the delete counts and returning the final result tuple, changing this method is indeed the correct approach for fixing the issue as per the reported behavior and scope.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5.

This function's behavior determines the output of zero deletions.\n   - `QuerySet.delete`: This span outlines the `delete` method in `QuerySet`, which interacts with the `Collector.delete` method and ultimately outputs its result. Ensuring that the `deleted_counter` is handled consistently masks directly into how `QuerySet.delete` returns results when no deletions occur.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n\n   Curated list of modified hunks:\n   - Hunk: 437-449 in `django/db/models/deletion.py`\n\n   Explanation:\n\n   <patch_exp>\n   - The added lines in `django/db/models/deletion.py` iterate over the models in `self.data`. For each model, it checks if the model's label is in the `deleted_counter`. If it is not, it adds an entry with a count of 0. This ensures that the returned `deleted_counter` dictionary consistently includes all models present in the `self.data`.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**:\n\n   <correct_location_exp>The patch is correctly applied within the location responsible for computing and returning the `deleted_counter`, i.e., `Collector.delete`. Ensuring that all models in `self.data` have an entry in `deleted_counter` precisely addresses the issue described.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n\n   <new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce any new issues. It only adds entries for models not present in the `deleted_counter`, setting their count to 0. This strictly increases consistency without negative repercussions.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>The patch fixes the given issue by ensuring that models involved in a delete operation, even if resulting in zero deletions, will be present in the `deleted_counter`. This resolves the inconsistency described in the issue, making the output format uniform whether or not foreign keys are involved.</fix_issue_exp>\n\nScore:\n\n<score>10</score>"

Specifically:\n- For models with foreign keys, the result is `(0, {})`.\n- For models without foreign keys, the result is `(0, {'my_app.BlockLibrary': 0})`.\nThe expectation is that both cases should have a consistent result: either an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero value.\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is with the `QuerySet.delete` method in Django where it returns inconsistent results when zero objects are deleted. For models with foreign keys, it returns a tuple `(0, {})`, while for models without foreign keys, it returns a tuple `(0, {'model_name': 0})`. The expected behavior is that both should return a consistent result format.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nList of span IDs:\n1. `Collector.delete`\n2. `QuerySet.delete`\n\nExplanation:\n- **Collector.delete**: This method is directly involved in the process of collecting and deleting model instances. The final result of the method is a tuple of the total number of deleted objects and a dictionary of counters per model. This method is responsible for generating the final return value, which is where the inconsistency lies.\n- **QuerySet.delete**: This method triggers the deletion process for all objects in a QuerySet by creating a `Collector` and calling its `delete` method. It is relevant because it is the entry point of the problematic behavior.\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan IDs:\n1. `Collector.delete`\n2. `QuerySet.delete`\n\n1. `Collector.delete`: This code span is responsible for collecting and deleting model instances and returning the tuple that includes the deleted objects count and a dictionary of counters per model.\n2. `QuerySet.delete`: This code span is responsible for initiating the deletion process for all objects in a QuerySet by creating a `Collector` object and invoking its `delete` method.

Modification in `django/db/models/deletion.py`\n2. New File: `tests/delete_regress/test_collector_consistency.py`\n3. Modification in `tests/test_settings.py`\n\nExplanation of Modified Hunks:\n- **django/db/models/deletion.py**:\n  The patch added a new section to the `delete` method to iterate through all models in `self.data` and ensure they have an entry in `deleted_counter` with a zero value if not already present. This should ensure consistency in the result format regardless of whether objects are deleted or not.\n\n- **tests/delete_regress/test_collector_consistency.py**:\n  This new test case validates the functionality of the `delete` method ensuring that the results are consistent. Two scenarios are tested:\n  - Deleting non-existing objects from a simple model without foreign keys.\n  - Deleting non-existing objects from a model with foreign keys.\n\n- **tests/test_settings.py**:\n  Modifications in settings file to include new test suite dependencies to ensure the testing framework is correctly set up.\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. File: `django/db/models/deletion.py`, Lines: 437-451\nThe added code ensures all models in `self.data` have an entry in `deleted_counter`, initializing it to zero if not present.\n\n2. New File: `tests/delete_regress/test_collector_consistency.py`\nIntroduces tests to verify the consistency of deletion results when no objects are deleted.\n\n3. File: `tests/test_settings.py`, Lines: Entire file\nUpdates settings to include the new test app for running the consistency tests in `django.db.models.deletion`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check Correct Function Location\nExplanation:\nThe patch correctly modifies the `delete` method in `Collector`, which is the function responsible for computing and returning the deletion results. No changes are needed in `QuerySet.delete` itself for the fix.\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly modifies the `delete` method in the `Collector` class, which is responsible for generating the deletion results.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\nExplanation:\nThe patch adds a loop to ensure all models in `self.data` are accounted for in `deleted_counter`. This modification is unlikely to introduce new issues and seems well-integrated with the existing logic. \n\nThere are no contradictions between the identified code spans and the new code.\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are introduced by the patch. There are no contradictions with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue\nExplanation:\nThe patch addresses the issue by ensuring that `deleted_counter` always has an entry for each model in `self.data`, defaulting to zero if no objects were deleted. This should ensure consistent returns for the end-user.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly ensures that the result format is consistent by introducing a check that all models in `self.data` have an entry in `deleted_counter`, defaulted to zero when there are no objects to delete. Thus, it effectively fixes the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score the Patch\n<score>10</score>"

Specifically, it ensures that all models tracked by the `Collector` have an entry in `deleted_counter`, setting it to zero if no objects were deleted for a model. This change aims to standardize the output.\n",

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue pertains to the consistent formatting of the result returned by the `QuerySet.Delete` method in Django when zero objects are deleted. In the current implementation, when no objects are deleted, the method returns `(0, {})` for models with foreign keys, and `(0, {'app.model': 0})` for simple models without foreign keys. The expected behavior is to standardize the result format so that it is consistent regardless of whether the models have foreign keys or not: both should either return an empty dictionary or a dictionary with model-label keys and zero values.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\n1. Collector.delete\n2. QuerySet.delete\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. The `Collector.delete` method is crucial because it performs the actual deletion of objects in Django\u2019s ORM, tracking and counting the number of instances deleted.\n2. The `QuerySet.delete` function initiates the deletion process of records that match the QuerySet, which eventually calls `Collector.delete` to process the deletions. This method ultimately returns the tuple that is expected to be standardized as per the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk: `django/db/models/deletion.py`\n\n   - Before Patch: Return statement:\n     ```python\n     return sum(deleted_counter.values()), dict(deleted_counter)\n     ```\n   - After Patch: \n     ```python\n     # Ensure all models in self.data have an entry in deleted_counter\n     for model in self.data:\n         if model._meta.label not in deleted_counter:\n             deleted_counter[model._meta.label] = 0\n\n     return sum(deleted_counter.values()), dict(deleted_counter)\n     ```\n   - Explanation: This patch modifies the return logic of the `delete` method in the `Collector` class. Specifically, it ensures that all models tracked by the `Collector` have an entry in `deleted_counter`, setting it to zero if no objects were deleted for a model. This change aims to standardize the output.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly modifies the `Collector.delete` method, which is responsible for counting and reporting the deletions. This is indeed the appropriate location to update for standardizing the deletion result.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new functional issues. However, it's placing extra items into the `deleted_counter` even if they are zero, which could be scrutinized regarding performance impact for large sets of deletions. There are no contradictions with identified code spans, as the modification concerns standardizing output rather than interfering with existing deletion workflows.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does fix the issue by ensuring that all models managed by the `Collector` are reflected in the `deleted_counter` dictionary, even if they have zero deletions. This way, the returned result is a consistent format of `(total_deleted, {'app.model': 0})`, aligning the outcomes irrespective of foreign key dependencies for models.\n\nThat said, common mistakes by LLMs include ignoring the overall context or creating a performance hit; none apply significantly here. This patch is context-aware and minimal, achieving the goal without introducing notable flaws. \n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"
