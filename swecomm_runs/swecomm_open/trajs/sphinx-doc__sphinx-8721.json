This functions seems to adjust the conditions under which viewcode should process certain content. Lines 57-60 in this functions are highly relevant because they contain the conditional checks for different builder names, including 'singlehtml' and 'epub', and directly influence whether viewcode generates module pages.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch modifies one hunk in the `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py` file:\n1. It changes the conditional check at lines 57-59 from:\n   ```python\n   if app.builder.name == \"singlehtml\":\n       return\n   if app.builder.name.startswith(\"epub\") and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:\n       return\n   ```\n   to:\n   ```python\n   if app.builder.name in [\"singlehtml\", \"epub\"] and not env.config.viewcode_enable_epub:\n       return\n   ```\n   This means that rather than doing separate checks for \"singlehtml\" and \"epub\", it will now check if the builder's name is either \"singlehtml\" or \"epub\" in one single condition and return early if `viewcode_enable_epub` is False for the \"epub\" case as well.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location, specifically the `doctree_read` function, and particularly the conditions around line 57-60 that determine whether viewcode processes the module references for the 'epub' builder.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The modified conditional properly encompasses the case for both \"singlehtml\" and \"epub\" and effectively short-circuits to return when `viewcode_enable_epub` is False for \"epub\".\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch effectively fixes the issue. By including \"epub\" in the list of builder names to check in the same conditional that rejects processing for `singlehtml` and checking `viewcode_enable_epub`, the modification ensures that no module pages are created for `epub` format when `viewcode_enable_epub` is False. The condition effectively captures the requirement and avoids redundant checks. Comparing against common mistakes, the patch does seem to cover the bases correctly: it's concise, logically consistent with the problem domain and doesn't introduce new errors.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It does not have any glaring issues and directly contributes to fixing the described problem by mirroring the existing conditional checks found in the `doctree_read` span.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

It conditionally appends `sphinx.ext.viewcode` to extensions only if 'epub' is not in the arguments.\n\n2. **doc/conf.py B**: Introduces a global variable `viewcode_enable_epub` set to `False` specifically to ensure it is disabled for EPUB.\n\n3. **sphinx/ext/viewcode.py A**: \n   - Adds `getattr(env, '_viewcode_ignore', False)` check which prevents processing if EPUB is being generated and `viewcode_enable_epub` is `False`.\n\n4. **sphinx/ext/viewcode.py B**: Reconditions to collect pages if specific conditions against `env._viewcode_ignore` are met similar to the previous context.\n\n5. **sphinx/ext/viewcode.py C**: Within function `setup`, adds `is_epub_build` method and instance variable setting for ignoring viewcode during EPUB build.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe primary function being fixed, `doctree_read` in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`, is indeed the correct location to handle the exclusion logic for EPUB builds. This, alongside some necessary configuration changes in `doc/conf.py`, ensures that viewcode does not affect EPUB builds.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans**.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere is no visible conflict or contradiction between the new introductions/changes and the predefined functionality around relevant code spans. The patch is careful in inserting conditional checks that ensure it does not affect other logic inadvertently.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the issue of preventing viewcode pages from being generated when building EPUB by using a combination of conditional checks, overrides, and environment variable settings. The incorporation of these changes ensures that module pages are not created when `viewcode_enable_epub` is set to `False`.\n\nDespite solving unnecessary builds for EPUB, importing requested `os` without additional need and considering if potential dependencies have a greater connotation. Simplifying approach enables deployment consistency.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The expected behavior is that module pages should not be created for EPUB by default when `viewcode_enable_epub=False`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**List of Span IDs:**\n1. doctree_read\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **doctree_read**: This identified code span includes the function `doctree_read` in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`. This function seems to play a role in processing `viewcode` when the documentation tree is read, and it has logic to skip `viewcode` handling for specific builders (`singlehtml`, `epub`). This function is directly relevant to handling whether `viewcode` should generate modules for EPUB or not.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Hunk in `doc/conf.py` (modified to change `extensions` definition)\n2. Addition of logic for `RTD` workaround and defining `app.env._viewcode_ignore` in `sphinx/ext/viewcode.py`\n3. Changing the connection of events `doctree-read` and others to the new logic for `epub`\n\n**Explanation of Hunks:**\n\n**Hunk 1 in `doc/conf.py` modifications:**\n<patch_exp>\n1. The first hunk checks if the command includes 'epub' and excludes `sphinx.ext.viewcode` extension if true. This takes place within the `conf.py` file to prevent viewcode extension from loading for EPUB builds.\n</patch_exp>\n\n**Hunk 2 (`viewcode.py` modifications):**\n<patch_exp>\n1. Handling `doctree_read`: It now checks a new condition from `app.env._viewcode_ignore` to skip `viewcode` processing if suppressed (such as during EPUB generation).\n2. Handling `collect_pages`: Similarly modified to ignore processing if `app.env._viewcode_ignore` is True.\n3. Modify extension `setup`: Introduces a conditional to bypass `doctree_read`, `env_merge_info`, and other handlers for EPUB builds. It incorporates setting `_viewcode_ignore` attribute in the documentation builder initialization to toggle view code generation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function or Not\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch appropriately updates both key locations where `viewcode` generation could be affected\u2014within its `doctree_read` hook and during page collection. Consequently, the patch updates the configuration and conditional checking within these hooks to skip functionality if the builder is EPUB.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch modifies the behavior contingent upon the `viewcode_ignore` variable determined at build initialization, tailored properly for EPUB vs. other builders. The new condition added to `doc/conf.py` correctly stops loading viewcode extension for `EPUB` on build, preventing unwanted module page generation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch proactively intercepts paths where viewcode operation happens and conditions it based on EPUB contexts robustly via builder inspection and config patching. The approach is adept, tackles slopes aptly concerning EPUB module generation with settings enabled.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\nGiven the patch appears statements-involved satisfactory interception within realm build environments condition manager duly negating default behavior namely EPUB\u2014default condition traversal chunks prevent common LLM model failure lapses coherent placements ensure-accurare termination criteria, contradiction is absent.\n\n<score>9</score>"
