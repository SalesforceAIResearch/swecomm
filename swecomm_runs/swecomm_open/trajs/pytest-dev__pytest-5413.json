Effectiveness of the Patch:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch should effectively fix the issue. By adding a `__str__` method to the `RaisesContext` class that outputs `str(self.excinfo.value)` if available, the behavior of `str(e)` in a `with pytest.raises(...) as e` context manager should now mimic that of a normal `try-except` block.

One way to\n+    deal with this problem is to assert that two floating-point numbers are\n+    equal to within some appropriate tolerance::\n+\n+        >>> abs((0.1 + 0.2) - 0.3) < 1e-6\n+        True\n+\n+    However, comparisons like this are tedious to write and difficult to\n+    understand.  Furthermore, absolute comparisons like the one above are\n+    usually discouraged because there's no tolerance that works well for all\n+    situations.  ``1e-6`` is good for numbers around ``1``, but too small for\n+    very big numbers and too big for very small ones.  It's better to express\n+    the tolerance as a fraction of the expected value, but relative comparisons\n+    like that are even more difficult to write correctly and concisely.\n+\n+    The ``approx`` class performs floating-point comparisons using a syntax\n+    that's as intuitive as possible::\n+\n+        >>> from pytest import approx\n+        >>> 0.1 + 0.2 == approx(0.3)\n+        True\n+\n+    The same syntax also works for sequences of numbers::\n+\n+        >>> (0.1 + 0.2, 0.2 + 0.4) == approx((0.3, 0.6))\n+        True\n+\n+    Dictionary *values*::\n+\n+        >>> {'a': 0.1 + 0.2, 'b': 0.2 + 0.4} == approx({'a': 0.3, 'b': 0.6})\n+        True\n+\n+    ``numpy`` arrays::\n+\n+        >>> import numpy as np                                                          # doctest: +SKIP\n+        >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.4]) == approx(np.array([0.3, 0.6])) # doctest: +SKIP\n+        True\n+\n+    And for a ``numpy`` array against a scalar::\n+\n+        >>> import numpy as np                                         # doctest: +SKIP\n+        >>> np.array([0.1, 0.2]) + np.array([0.2, 0.1]) == approx(0.3) # doctest: +SKIP\n+        True\n+\n+    By default, ``approx`` considers numbers within a relative tolerance of\n+    ``1e-6`` (i.e. one part in a million) of its expected value to be equal.\n+    This treatment would lead to surprising results if the expected value was\n+    ``0.0``, because nothing but ``0.0`` itself is relatively close to ``0.0``.\n+    To handle this case less surprisingly, ``approx`` also considers numbers\n+    within an absolute tolerance of ``1e-12`` of its expected value to be\n+    equal.  Infinity and NaN are special cases.  Infinity is only considered\n+    equal to itself, regardless of the relative tolerance.  NaN is not\n+    considered equal to anything by default, but you can make it be equal to\n+    itself by setting the ``nan_ok`` argument to True.  (This is meant to\n+    facilitate comparing arrays that use NaN to mean \"no data\".)\n+\n+    Both the relative and absolute tolerances can be changed by passing\n+    arguments to the ``approx`` constructor::\n+\n+        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1)\n+        False\n+        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, rel=1e-3)\n+        True\n+        >>> 1.0001 == approx(1, abs=1e-3)\n+        True\n+\n+    If you specify ``abs`` but not ``rel``, the comparison will not consider\n+    the relative tolerance at all.  In other words, two numbers that are within\n+    the default relative tolerance of ``1e-6`` will still be considered unequal\n+    if they exceed the specified absolute tolerance.  If you specify both\n+    ``abs`` and ``rel``, the numbers will be considered equal if either\n+    tolerance is met::\n+\n+        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1)\n+        True\n+        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, abs=1e-12)\n+        False\n+        >>> 1 + 1e-8 == approx(1, rel=1e-6, abs=1e-12)\n+        True\n+\n+    If you're thinking about using ``approx``, then you might want to know how\n+    it compares to other good ways of comparing floating-point numbers.  All of\n+    these algorithms are based on relative and absolute tolerances and should\n+    agree for the most part, but they do have meaningful differences:\n+\n+    - ``math.isclose(a, b, rel_tol=1e-9, abs_tol=0.0)``:  True if the relative\n+      tolerance is met w.r.t. either ``a`` or ``b`` or if the absolute\n+      tolerance is met.  Because the relative tolerance is calculated w.r.t.\n+      both ``a`` and ``b``, this test is symmetric (i.e.  neither ``a`` nor\n+      ``b`` is a \"reference value\").
