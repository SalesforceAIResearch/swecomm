The problem is traced to `django.db.models.sql.query.Query.resolve_lookup_value` which does not correctly handle the reconstitution of named tuples by passing an iterator to their constructor. To resolve this, the contents of the iterator should be expanded into the constructor.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nQuery.resolve_lookup_value\nRange\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Query.resolve_lookup_value**:\n  This method is directly involved in resolving the values passed to query lookups and is responsible for reconstructing the tuple which fails for named tuples, causing the observed issue.\n\n- **Range**:\n  This lookup is the target where the problem occurs specifically with the `__range` filter.

It adds a practical test to confirm named tuple handling, bolstering code assurance. It does not fall into prevalent mistakes by pointlessly convoluting, miss-unsolved errors, nor inflicting new logical issues into the context worked on. This patch seems valid and well-commanding.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
