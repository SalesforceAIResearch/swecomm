It adds checks and filters strictly related to the description settings and manages to handle them correctly.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the issue. It correctly identifies and removes `VAR_POSITIONAL` and `VAR_KEYWORD` parameters when `autodoc_typehints` is set to \"description\". Additionally, it removes duplicated `*args` and `**kwargs` sections from the generated content if these fields are identified more than once, ensuring faithful representation according to the said setting.

Since the reported issue relates to the duplication and documentation of function parameters, they are relevant.\n\n- **MethodDocumenter.format_signature, MethodDocumenter.format_args, FunctionDocumenter.format_signature, FunctionDocumenter.format_args**: These methods specifically handle the formatting and output of function and method signatures. The duplications described in the issue are likely controlled inside these methods.\n\n- **merge_typehints and record_typehints**: These functions work with type hints, determining how they are merged and recorded during the process of documentation generation. `merge_typehints` may ensure proper inclusion of type information and using type hints which appears crucial in resolving the reported issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk from line 114-133 in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`**:\n    - Added a condition to check if the parameter name is `*args` or `**kwargs`. If true, it skips adding `type` fields for these parameters.\n2. **Hunk from line 170-178 in `sphinx/ext/autodoc/typehints.py`**:\n    - Similarly added a condition to skip adding `type` fields for `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the places in the code (within `typehints.py`) that handle the addition of type information for parameters. These locations are consistent with fixing the issue of duplicated and incomplete `*args` and `**kwargs` documentation output.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are being introduced related to identified code spans. The patch ensures `*args` and `**kwargs` are correctly skipped where they don't need type information, and no contradictions exist with known code span functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch specifically checks for `*args` and `**kwargs` before adding type fields and parameter fields, effectively removing the duplication in the documentation that was present previously. There is no irrelevant change that may introduce issues. Hence, it should fix the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
