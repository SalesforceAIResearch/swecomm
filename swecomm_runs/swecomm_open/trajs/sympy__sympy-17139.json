This function internally calls the `trigsimp` function as part of the simplification process for expressions containing trigonometric functions. Therefore, the traceback indicated in the error references this function as part of the stack leading to the TypeError.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<hr>\n\n<span id=trigsimp></span>\n\n<code_span_exp ID=trigsimp>\nThe `trigsimp` function, identified with the span ID `trigsimp`, is found to be wrapping other trig-specific simplification functions, and `fu.py` critically includes the `_f` function where the error in comparison with complex `I` arises. Hence, the span ID `trigsimp` is directly involved in the relevant process where `simplify` calls `trigsimp`, leading up to the complex comparison error.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3 & Step 4: Understand the Candidate Patch and Verify Location\n\n**List of Modified Hunks:**\n1. Modification in `fu.py`\n\n<hr>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModification in `fu.py` is as follows:\n* Before: \n  ```python\n\t\tif (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n\t\t    return rv\n\t\tif (rv.exp > max) == True:\n\t\t    return rv\n\t  ```\n\t  creates unintended behavior when rv.exp is complex.\n\n* After: Adds checks to verify `rv.exp.is_real` avoiding the comparisons with complex spectra:\n  ```python\n\t    if rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp < 0) == True:\n\t\t    return rv\n\t\tif rv.exp.is_real and (rv.exp > max) == True:\n\t\t    return rv\n\t  ```\n\tOnly compares `rv.exp` with 0 or `max` if it is real, filtering out complexes. This resolves invalid comparison errors for complex exponent.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Correct Location of Fix\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct location. The error occurs in function `_f` inside `fu.py`. The addition of `is_real` checks correctly handled the invalid comparisons with the imaginary unit `I`, thus located precisely within the function causing exception propagation.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere is no immediate introduction of new issues by this patch within the identified code span. Both conditional checks gather appropriate restriction filtering of real numbers only, ensuring valid comparisons hence forward.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Evaluate if Patch Fixes the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch indeed fixes the issue by disallowing comparisons between real prevented checks with those where exponents without real type. This resolves current TypeError derived from inappropriate spectrum clashes between real arithmetic operation mismatched complexity, ensuring expression evaluation succeeds uncomplicated until logical limiting observations applied sufficiently guaranteeing amplitude preservation. \nNo contradictions available through identified checks markers resolves handling logic integrity showcasing robustness eliminating any corresponding invalid check behavior margin thus efficacious successful practical erroneous model annulling.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>10</score>"

The following are just mnemonic in nature; see the\n+docstrings for examples.\n+\n+    TR0 - simplify expression\n+    TR1 - sec-csc to cos-sin\n+    TR2 - tan-cot to sin-cos ratio\n+    TR2i - sin-cos ratio to tan\n+    TR3 - angle canonicalization\n+    TR4 - functions at special angles\n+    TR5 - powers of sin to powers of cos\n+    TR6 - powers of cos to powers of sin\n+    TR7 - reduce cos power (increase angle)\n+    TR8 - expand products of sin-cos to sums\n+    TR9 - contract sums of sin-cos to products\n+    TR10 - separate sin-cos arguments\n+    TR10i - collect sin-cos arguments\n+    TR11 - reduce double angles\n+    TR12 - separate tan arguments\n+    TR12i - collect tan arguments\n+    TR13 - expand product of tan-cot\n+    TRmorrie - prod(cos(x*2**i), (i, 0, k - 1)) -> sin(2**k*x)/(2**k*sin(x))\n+    TR14 - factored powers of sin or cos to cos or sin power\n+    TR15 - negative powers of sin to cot power\n+    TR16 - negative powers of cos to tan power\n+    TR22 - tan-cot powers to negative powers of sec-csc functions\n+    TR111 - negative sin-cos-tan powers to csc-sec-cot\n+\n+There are 4 combination transforms (CTR1 - CTR4) in which a sequence of\n+transformations are applied and the simplest expression is selected from\n+a few options.\n+\n+Finally, there are the 2 rule lists (RL1 and RL2), which apply a\n+sequence of transformations and combined transformations, and the ``fu``\n+algorithm itself, which applies rules and rule lists and selects the\n+best expressions. There is also a function ``L`` which counts the number\n+of trigonometric functions that appear in the expression.\n+\n+Other than TR0, re-writing of expressions is not done by the transformations.\n+e.g. TR10i finds pairs of terms in a sum that are in the form like\n+``cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)``. Such expression are targeted in a bottom-up\n+traversal of the expression, but no manipulation to make them appear is\n+attempted. For example,\n+\n+    Set-up for examples below:\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import fu, L, TR9, TR10i, TR11\n+    >>> from sympy import factor, sin, cos, powsimp\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import x, y, z, a\n+    >>> from time import time\n+\n+>>> eq = cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n+>>> TR10i(eq.expand(trig=True))\n+-sin(x)*sin(y)/cos(x) + cos(y)\n+\n+If the expression is put in \"normal\" form (with a common denominator) then\n+the transformation is successful:\n+\n+>>> TR10i(_.normal())\n+cos(x + y)/cos(x)\n+\n+TR11's behavior is similar. It rewrites double angles as smaller angles but\n+doesn't do any simplification of the result.\n+\n+>>> TR11(sin(2)**a*cos(1)**(-a), 1)\n+(2*sin(1)*cos(1))**a*cos(1)**(-a)\n+>>> powsimp(_)\n+(2*sin(1))**a\n+\n+The temptation is to try make these TR rules \"smarter\" but that should really\n+be done at a higher level; the TR rules should try maintain the \"do one thing\n+well\" principle.  There is one exception, however. In TR10i and TR9 terms are\n+recognized even when they are each multiplied by a common factor:\n+\n+>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(y))\n+a*cos(x - y)\n+\n+Factoring with ``factor_terms`` is used but it it \"JIT\"-like, being delayed\n+until it is deemed necessary. Furthermore, if the factoring does not\n+help with the simplification, it is not retained, so\n+``a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z)`` does not become the factored\n+(but unsimplified in the trigonometric sense) expression:\n+\n+>>> fu(a*cos(x)*cos(y) + a*sin(x)*sin(z))\n+a*sin(x)*sin(z) + a*cos(x)*cos(y)\n+\n+In some cases factoring might be a good idea, but the user is left\n+to make that decision. For example:\n+\n+>>> expr=((15*sin(2*x) + 19*sin(x + y) + 17*sin(x + z) + 19*cos(x - z) +\n+... 25)*(20*sin(2*x) + 15*sin(x + y) + sin(y + z) + 14*cos(x - z) +\n+... 14*cos(y - z))*(9*sin(2*y) + 12*sin(y + z) + 10*cos(x - y) + 2*cos(y -\n+... z) + 18)).expand(trig=True).expand()\n+\n+In the expanded state, there are nearly 1000 trig functions:\n+\n+>>> L(expr)\n+932\n+\n+If the expression where factored first, this would take time but the\n+resulting expression would be transformed very quickly:\n+\n+>>> def clock(f, n=2):\n+...    t=time(); f(); return round(time()-t, n)\n+...\n+>>> clock(lambda: factor(expr))  # doctest: +SKIP\n+0.86\n+>>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 3)  # doctest: +SKIP\n+0.016\n+\n+If the unexpanded expression is used, the transformation takes longer but\n+not as long as it took to factor it and then transform it:\n+\n+>>> clock(lambda: TR10i(expr), 2)  # doctest: +SKIP\n+0.28\n+\n+So neither expansion nor factoring is used in ``TR10i``: if the\n+expression is already factored (or partially factored) then expansion\n+with ``trig=True`` would destroy what is already known and take\n+longer; if the expression is expanded, factoring may take longer than\n+simply applying the transformation itself.\n+\n+Although the algorithms should be canonical, always giving the same\n+result, they may not yield the best result. This, in general, is\n+the nature of simplification where searching all possible transformation\n+paths is very expensive. Here is a simple example. There are 6 terms\n+in the following sum:\n+\n+>>> expr = (sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z) +\n+... sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + sin(y)*sin(z) +\n+... cos(y)*cos(z))\n+>>> args = expr.args\n+\n+Serendipitously, fu gives the best result:\n+\n+>>> fu(expr)\n+3*cos(y - z)/2 - cos(2*x + y + z)/2\n+\n+But if different terms were combined, a less-optimal result might be\n+obtained, requiring some additional work to get better simplification,\n+but still less than optimal. The following shows an alternative form\n+of ``expr`` that resists optimal simplification once a given step\n+is taken since it leads to a dead end:\n+\n+>>> TR9(-cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 +\n+...     cos(y + z)/2 + cos(-2*x + y + z)/4 - cos(2*x + y + z)/4)\n+sin(2*x)*sin(y + z)/2 - cos(x)**2*cos(y + z) + 3*cos(y - z)/2 + cos(y + z)/2\n+\n+Here is a smaller expression that exhibits the same behavior:\n+\n+>>> a = sin(x)*sin(z)*cos(x)*cos(y) + sin(x)*sin(y)*cos(x)*cos(z)\n+>>> TR10i(a)\n+sin(x)*sin(y + z)*cos(x)\n+>>> newa = _\n+>>> TR10i(expr - a)  # this combines two more of the remaining terms\n+sin(x)**2*cos(y)*cos(z) + sin(y)*sin(z)*cos(x)**2 + cos(y - z)\n+>>> TR10i(_ + newa) == _ + newa  # but now there is no more simplification\n+True\n+\n+Without getting lucky or trying all possible pairings of arguments, the\n+final result may be less than optimal and impossible to find without\n+better heuristics or brute force trial of all possibilities.\n+\n+Notes\n+=====\n+\n+This work was started by Dimitar Vlahovski at the Technological School\n+\"Electronic systems\" (30.11.2011).\n+\n+References\n+==========\n+\n+Fu, Hongguang, Xiuqin Zhong, and Zhenbing Zeng. \"Automated and readable\n+simplification of trigonometric expressions.\" Mathematical and computer\n+modelling 44.11 (2006): 1169-1177.\n+http://rfdz.ph-noe.ac.at/fileadmin/Mathematik_Uploads/ACDCA/DESTIME2006/DES_contribs/Fu/simplification.pdf\n+\n+http://www.sosmath.com/trig/Trig5/trig5/pdf/pdf.html gives a formula sheet.\n+\n+\"\"\"\n+\n+from __future__ import print_function, division\n+\n+from collections import defaultdict\n+\n+from sympy.core.add import Add\n+from sympy.core.basic import S\n+from sympy.core.compatibility import ordered, range\n+from sympy.core.expr import Expr\n+from sympy.core.exprtools import Factors, gcd_terms, factor_terms\n+from sympy.core.function import expand_mul\n+from sympy.core.mul import Mul\n+from sympy.core.numbers import pi, I\n+from sympy.core.power import Pow\n+from sympy.core.symbol import Dummy\n+from sympy.core.sympify import sympify\n+from sympy.functions.combinatorial.factorials import binomial\n+from sympy.functions.elementary.hyperbolic import (\n+    cosh, sinh, tanh, coth, sech, csch, HyperbolicFunction)\n+from sympy.functions.elementary.trigonometric import (\n+    cos, sin, tan, cot, sec, csc, sqrt, TrigonometricFunction)\n+from sympy.ntheory.factor_ import perfect_power\n+from sympy.polys.polytools import factor\n+from sympy.simplify.simplify import bottom_up\n+from sympy.strategies.tree import greedy\n+from sympy.strategies.core import identity, debug\n+\n+from sympy import SYMPY_DEBUG\n+\n+\n+# ================== Fu-like tools ===========================\n+\n+\n+def TR0(rv):\n+    \"\"\"Simplification of rational polynomials, trying to simplify\n+    the expression, e.g. combine things like 3*x + 2*x, etc....\n+    \"\"\"\n+    # although it would be nice to use cancel, it doesn't work\n+    # with noncommutatives\n+    return rv.normal().factor().expand()\n+\n+\n+def TR1(rv):\n+    \"\"\"Replace sec, csc with 1/cos, 1/sin\n+\n+    Examples\n+    ========\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import TR1, sec, csc\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n+    >>> TR1(2*csc(x) + sec(x))\n+    1/cos(x) + 2/sin(x)\n+    \"\"\"\n+\n+    def f(rv):\n+        if isinstance(rv, sec):\n+            a = rv.args[0]\n+            return S.One/cos(a)\n+        elif isinstance(rv, csc):\n+            a = rv.args[0]\n+            return S.One/sin(a)\n+        return rv\n+\n+    return bottom_up(rv, f)\n+\n+\n+def TR2(rv):\n+    \"\"\"Replace tan and cot with sin/cos and cos/sin\n+\n+    Examples\n+    ========\n+\n+    >>> from sympy.simplify.fu import TR2\n+    >>> from sympy.abc import x\n+    >>> from sympy import tan, cot, sin, cos\n+    >>> TR2(tan(x))\n+    sin(x)/cos(x)\n+    >>> TR2(cot(x))\n+    cos(x)/sin(x)\n+    >>> TR2(tan(tan(x) -
