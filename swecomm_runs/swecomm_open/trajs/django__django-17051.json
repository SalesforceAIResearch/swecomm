The patch is logically sound; it correctly integrates with the SQL insertion and returning logic to provide the requested functionality.\n\nCommon mistakes:\n  - **Misidentification of Return Path**: This patch correctly originally locates and identifies the right `_insert` helper to inject returning logs.\n  - **Incomplete Conditional Logic**: The required conditional checks are properly structured inside conflict resolution if trees; therefore addresses and solves conflict-behavior discrepancies.\n  - **Placeholder Insertion Synergies**: The threading of placeholder all LOGICS here sync can_insert concern ironing SQLInsert aspects are correctly matching expectations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

However, a critical oversight: the actual `_insert` and underlying SQL compiler code should have provision to handle returning clauses when conflicts are updated. Suppose these helper methods lack full support to rightly include return clauses. In that case, theoretical inclusion within `bulk_create` won't ensure IDs are always fetched and assigned correctly.\n\nMoreover, it was important to ensure thorough contextual code patching functionality across linked module functions rather surface logical '-' `bulk_create' method for functional theoretical resolve without hademic bugs and conformance testing modules.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "1. **Understanding the Issue:**\n   **Issue Description:** The issue revolves around the `bulk_create()` method in Django. Currently, when using `bulk_create()` with conflict handling options (`ignore_conflicts` or `update_conflicts`), primary keys (IDs) are not being returned. The IDs are not set in the returned queryset, which is documented in `bulk_create`. While it's understandable why `ignore_conflicts` should behave this way due to potential optimization reasons from PostgreSQL, it doesn't make sense for `update_conflicts`. The issue attempt is to include the `RETURNING my_model.id` clause in the SQL query to address scenarios involving `update_conflicts` so that IDs are appropriately returned.\n\n<issue_exp> The issue involves `bulk_create` method in Django not returning IDs when using the `update_conflicts` flag.

Comparing against potential common mistakes, it does:\n\n1. Ensure relevant change only within necessary checks (`can_return_rows_from_bulk_insert` specific to conflict handling with updates).\n2. Maintain logic flow without breaking previous functionality.\n3. Doesn't seem to overlook or cause regression based on identified code spans.\n\nHowever, here are a few things to be cautious about:\n1. It doesn't handle scenarios where `on_conflict` could introduce some complexities or edge cases.\n2. It assumes the existence and behavior of `OnConflict``enums like `UPDATE being straightforward, which might require more extensive testing in different configurations for PostgreSQL, especially other than PostgreSQL edge cases if supported.\n\nAt initial glance, the fix should work for the described issue but should be cross-verified with diverse testing approaches.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Modification here could ensure that IDs are returned upon updating conflicts.\n\n3. `QuerySet._batched_insert`: Helper method to handle the process of inserting objects in batches. Changes here may be needed to align with modifications done to bulk_create to return IDs appropriately.\n\n4. `QuerySet._insert`: Underneath the bulk create logic, this method inserts rows into the DB and receives returning fields when any. It's relevant as integrating returning of IDs when conflicts update might utilize this method.\n\n5. `SQLInsertCompiler.as_sql`: Prepares the insert SQL statement. An appropriate part to implement RETURNING clause accounting for various scenarios including conflict resolution types.\n\n6. `SQLInsertCompiler.execute_sql`: Executes SQL statements and processes the result sets. This might help in facilitating the correct return flow for the retrieved IDs especially from inserts handling conflicts.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n**Modified hunks:**\n- `django/db/models/query.py`\n\n<hunks>\n- From `\"a/django/db/models/query.py\" line 807`\n</hunks>\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch changes the conditional check in `django/db/models/query.py` at line 814. It inserts:\n``` python\nand (on_conflict is None or on_conflict == OnConflict.UPDATE)\n```\nThis ensures that the returned columns clause mechanisms traditionally running only when `on_conflict` is None also triggers when `on_conflict` equals `OnConflict.UPDATE`.\n817: This extends the assertion to cover when updating conflicts without disrupting the expected returned indicated columns.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the candidate patch is fixing the correct function. The context, mainly checks, and actions on `connection.features.can_return_rows_from_bulk_insert`, pertains to PostgreSQL DB's ability to return rows when performing bulk inserts. Parameter modifications align with the logical entry point for this conflict type extension.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues have been introduced by the patch. The adaptations in place-to opine `update conflicts` alongside existing conditions for `can_return_rows_from_bulk_insert` validation feels sane, preserving the desired returned columns contraints appropriately and without disrupting the rest of the logic flow.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to solve the described problem effectively by modifying an appropriate context for chosen flags aligned mechanism to assure output of required IDs when conflicts are resolved by updates. However, safeguarding through wider testing confirms resulting IDs on indicated bulk create USQL inserts holds as much of its fidelity. Moreover, inspecting if other occurrences ostensibly missed post the ortek of functions and surrounding context deliver impeccable fix denount symptom backdrop presumes timely automation resilience or amendered guarded.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
