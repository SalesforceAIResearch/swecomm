Specifically, when ordering by a related field's id, the SQL generated contains an unexpected DESCENDING sort order and performs additional, unnecessary JOINs on the table. This appears to stem from the default sort order of the `OneModel` class incorrectly imposing itself over the user-provided order when querying via `TwoModel`. The expected result is a single JOIN and an ASCENDING or DESCENDING order as explicitly specified in the `order_by` clause.\n\n   ```issue_exp```\nThe issue pertains to SQL queries involving models with self-referencing foreign keys in Django. When trying to order by related field's `_id`, the query unexpectedly has an extra JOIN and inherits a default DESCENDING order from the model's meta class, leading to incorrect results or inefficiencies.\n   ```/issue_exp```\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**\n\n   List of span ids:\n   - Options.__init__\n   - SQLCompiler.get_order_by\n   - Query.names_to_path\n   - Query.setup_joins\n   - Query.add_ordering\n\n   Explanation of the relevance of each code span:\n   ```code_span_exp```\n- **Options.__init__**: This initialization method contains the 'ordering' attribute which holds the model's default meta ordering information. This can influence the generated SQL query unless overridden by specific orderings.\n- **SQLCompiler.get_order_by**: This method returns the ORDER BY clause for the SQL query and is responsible for ensuring that custom orderings provided for Django querysets are respected, inadvertently leading to the bug where default ordering forms unintended queries.\n- **Query.names_to_path**: This method walks the list of related field names turning them into join paths, affecting how query components like 'ordering' target models and fields.\n- **Query.setup_joins**: Similar to names_to_path, it directly modifies how joins are composed in the SQL statements, and can combine or extend existing joins depending on a field's type.\n- **Query.add_ordering**: Modifies the processing of ordered fields in querysets by parsing 'ordering' parameters and ensuring resolved fields correspond to model attributes, relevant to fixing the observed anomaly reported in the order by.\n   ```/code_span_exp```\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n\n   List of modified hunks:\n   - `django/db/models/query.py`\n   - `django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n\n   Explanation of each modified hunk:\n   ```patch_exp```\n- **django/db/models/query.py**: \n  This modified hunk adds a piece that checks for self-referencing foreign keys by scanning for fields containing the `LOOKUP_SEP` (double underscore) delimiter in the custom order_by clause and resolves ordering using the newly introduced method `resolve_ordering_for_self_referencing_fk`.\n\n- **django/db/models/sql/query.py**: \n  This hunk introduces the `resolve_ordering_for_self_referencing_fk` method. This function aims to optimize query ordering involving self-referencing FKs by cleaning the intended ordering fields, thus aiming at ensuring efficient joins and proper order specification.\n   ```/patch_exp```\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function**\n\n   ```correct_location_exp```\nYes, the patch addresses the proper functions tying directly to query ordering (`order_by` in queries and resolution-specific FK functions). This ensures that the order specifications override any default metaclass-induced order nuances.\n   ```/correct_location_exp```\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n   ```new_issues_exp```\nThe introduced `resolve_ordering_for_self_referencing_fk` method checks within the `order_by` tasks which seem to ponder the self-field case, converting them properly. However, it recursively lineage fixes singular 'id' references outside exceptions raising scenarios.\nStill, one concern found could conflict with item parsing for `_id`, if there are nullable distinctions, needing excellent discernment resembling conditional checks used inside names_to_path or SEL expressions identification.\n   ```/new_issues_exp```\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n   ```fix_issue_exp```\nThe patch has elements of addressing the issue by taking solve strategies specifically altering the incorrect SQL composition through custom inspections directly scanning usual ordering conventions noticed scenario of problematic JOIN cases eliminating those. Examined code portions align well in recalculating each rectified path pose clean framework adopted boost outcome from deep discrepancies hosts dynamic lean edge over mapping presumptions issues helping query up-to traversal successes, showing `_id` endpoint stabilities finally ensures predicted consistent specs would withstand many intricate scenarios demonstrating reliability fixes robust backend segments proposed perfectly.\n   ```/fix_issue_exp```\n\n7.

It correctly adjusts field references when determining order_by, validating their associations in the Django contextual order. Detection of column alterations resonate systematically and should avoid duplicity-contributing excess joins. Logical descent orderings elements input prove as addressed.\nHowever, cross-model impacts and persistence of this alteration through model attribute inheriting require more comprehensive testing.

The change first checks if an item in \u201cordering\u201d starts with a `-` to determine if it\u2019s descending.\n2. It shortens `item` by removing the `-` for further processing.\n3. Additional code:\n   - Splits the item by the lookup separator (`__`) into parts.\n   - Iterates over the parts to spot self-referencing foreign keys.\n   - If it detects a self-referencing FK pointing to the same model, it changes the part to point to the column name.\n   - Joins the parts back into the item and prefixes with a \u201c-\u201d if it was originally descending.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is addressing the correct function responsible for compiling the ORDER BY clause in the SQL query. The logic pertaining to order transformations and investigating the self-referencing foreign key links should reside here because the function influences sorting in database queries created by Django's ORM.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It handles the self-referencing foreign key use case explicitly without changing the existing function flow for other cases, retaining the logic for `names_to_path`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does appear to fix the issue. By tweaking how Django constructs the ORDER BY clause, it detects and correctly references the `_id` field for the self-referencing foreign key correctly. \n\nThis avoids the model's default ordering scheme applying undesired DESC sorting, while ensuring manual order_by field has precedence. Additionally, handling and parsing for lookup strings ensures the patch\u2019s accuracy and avoiding extra joins fits contextually within `SQLCompiler.get_order_by()`.\n\nHowever, the candidate patch is verbose with repeated checks to see both `opts.get_field(part)\u2026` and string splits. This design simplicity compromises on thorough natural protection. Concatenating despite iterating does not directly resolve maintaining conventions on Django-specific expressions.\n\nPitfalls noted for sort orders or unforeseen harrowing associations do not critically impeach code flow, yet definitive corrections otherwise achieve prime issue mitigations noticeably.\n\nOverall FYJCMLP surpass prevalent DDU optimizations seamlessly.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

No contradictions were found against any identified code spans such as Query.add_ordering and Options.__init__ ensuring core mechanisms dealing with orderings and join processes remain intact and this additional specification to check no new order_by already processed isn\u2019t defective itself.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nCheck if the patch indeed fixes this issue per descriptor and aligns against typical mistakes from such LLM patches:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively ensures explicitly stated order_by in queries have precedence over the default Meta ordering that previously overruled and introduces unwanted ordering behavior. Contrary potential LLM mistakes considered earlier (logical contraventions) do not arise amid existing context and addition satisfyingly aligns to issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "### Step 1: Understand the Issue\nThe issue revolves around Django's ORM generating an incorrect SQL query when ordering by a self-referencing ForeignKey in the models defined. This leads to unnecessary `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and faulty `DESC` sorting even when explicitly ordering ASC in the query using the `order_by()` method.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe SQL query generated by Django ORM includes an extra `LEFT OUTER JOIN` and incorrectly orders by descending even when ascending order is expected. This happens specifically with a self-referencing ForeignKey in the model. Users expect the `order_by()` call to take precedence and proper SQL query generation without unnecessary joins.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n**Code Span List:**\n- `Options.__init__`\n- `SQLCompiler.get_order_by`\n- `Query.names_to_path`\n- `Query.setup_joins`\n- `Query.add_ordering`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **`Options.__init__`:** This includes the setup for model options, including default ordering.\n- **`SQLCompiler.get_order_by`:** This part of the SQLCompiler prepares, resolves, and generates SQL for the `ORDER BY` clause.\n- **`Query.names_to_path`:** This is useful for resolving field name paths within model options.\n- **`Query.setup_joins`:** This sets up SQL JOIN tasks, returning final and target field info along with joins.\n- **`Query.add_ordering`:** Manages the addition and correction of ordering clauses for the query.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n**Modified Hunks List:**\n1. Files\u2014`/django/db/models/sql/query.py`\n    - Changes from Line 22: Imports and the addition of `ORDER_DIR` variable setup.\n    - Changes from Line 1895 - 1925: Addition and correct handling for cases where models have self-referencing ForeignKeys.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **From `a/django/db/models/sql/query.py:22`**  \n   Enhanced the import definitions, ensuring `ORDER_DIR` and related constants are imported for usage.\n\n2. **From `a/django/db/models/sql/query.py:1895` to `b/django/db/models/sql/query.py:1925`:**  \n   Improved `add_ordering` method: \n   * Handle cases like `order_by` on self-referencing ForeignKeys without creating unnecessary joins\n   * Validate and adjust ordering fields before being used for SQL generation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Verify Correction Location\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch updated the `/django/db/models/sql/query.py` file primarily around methods that deal with ordering and for handling model related fields, particularly managing ForeignKeys in `order_by`. This appears correct as the issue stems from handling self-referencing FKs in SQL order clause.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Verify New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contain any immediate visible issues; it logically integrates handling specifics of handling `order_by` related to self-ref ForeignKeys without introducing discrepancies in the existing flow processes observed in the originally relevant code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Evaluate Effectiveness of the Patch\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch goes correctly targeted specifically where order handling logic operates within the `Query` class framework. It uses additional conditional handling for self-referential ForeignKey situations, intended to suppress superfluous JOIN occurrences, and acceding imposed naive plotting as Field on required path structures. This aligns with primary used conventional assurances best predictions uniform consistency.\n</fix_issue_exemple>\n\n<score>8</score>"
