It uses the parameters set during initialization, and inconsistencies or errors in comparisons could propagate here.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks along with their explanation:\n\n#### Modified Hunk:\n<patch_exp>\n- The patch modifies the `print_changed_only` functionality in the file `sklearn/utils/_pprint.py`.\n- It changes the comparison `v != init_params[k]` to `not np.array_equal(v, init_params[k])`.\n- This means it replaces the direct comparison to one that works with numpy arrays, requiring equality of arrays rather than ambiguous truth value checks.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Validate the Correct Location\n\n#### Check Fix Location:\n<correct_location_exp>\n- The patch is correctly modifying the method that handles printing configurations for changed parameters.\n- Given the issue involves comparing `LogisticRegressionCV`'s parameters, fixing the comparison between parameter defaults and their current values is relevant.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if Introducing New Issues\n\n#### New Issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\n- The patch doesn't introduce any new contradicting logic within the identified spans since it's changing the parameter comparison to a logic that handles arrays correctly.\n- The transition from a direct comparison using `!=` to `not np.array_equal` should be seamless for other comparable types.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue\n\n#### Effectiveness of the Fix:\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- The patch addresses the principal reasoning behind the `ValueError`.\n- Direct comparison of numpy arrays leads to ambiguity. Changing this to `np.array_equal` handles the comparison accurately.\n- Common mistakes checked: The fix does not suffer from context ignorance around numpy arrays or missing necessary imports/components. It's straightforward and appropriate.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score Printing\n<score>10</score>"
