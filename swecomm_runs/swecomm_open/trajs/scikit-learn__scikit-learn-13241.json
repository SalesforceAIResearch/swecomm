For\n+  :func:`~model_selection.learning_curve`, and\n+  :func:`~model_selection.validation_curve` only the latter is required.\n+  :issue:`12613` and :issue:`12669` by :user:`Marc Torrellas <marctorrellas>`.\n+\n+:mod:`sklearn.neighbors`\n+........................\n+\n+- |API| Methods in :class:`neighbors.NearestNeighbors` :\n+  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors`,\n+  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors`,\n+  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.kneighbors_graph`,\n+  :func:`~neighbors.NearestNeighbors.radius_neighbors_graph`\n+  now raise ``NotFittedError``, rather than ``AttributeError``,\n+  when called before ``fit`` :issue:`12279` by :user:`Krishna Sangeeth\n+  <whiletruelearn>`.\n+\n+:mod:`sklearn.neural_network`\n+.............................\n+\n+- |Fix| Fixed a bug in :class:`neural_network.MLPClassifier` and\n+  :class:`neural_network.MLPRegressor` where the option :code:`shuffle=False`\n+  was being ignored. :issue:`12582` by :user:`Sam Waterbury <samwaterbury>`.\n+\n+:mod:`sklearn.pipeline`\n+.......................\n+\n+- |API| :class:`pipeline.Pipeline` now supports using ``'passthrough'`` as a\n+  transformer. :issue:`11144` by :user:`Thomas Fan <thomasjpfan>`.\n+\n+:mod:`sklearn.preprocessing`\n+............................\n+\n+- |Efficiency| Make :class:`preprocessing.MultiLabelBinarizer` to cache class\n+  mappings instead of calculating it every time on the fly.\n+  :issue:`12116` by :user:`Ekaterina Krivich <kiote>` and `Joel Nothman`_.\n+\n+- |Efficiency| :class:`preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures` now supports compressed\n+  sparse row (CSR) matrices as input for degrees 2 and 3. This is typically much\n+  faster than the dense case as it scales with matrix density and expansion degree\n+  (on the order of density^degree), and is much, much faster than the compressed\n+  sparse column (CSC) case. :issue:`12197` by :user:`Andrew Nystrom <awnystrom>`.\n+\n+- |Efficiency| |API| Speed improvement in :class:`preprocessing.PolynomialFeatures`,\n+  in the dense case.

This inconsistency occurs despite the absolute values being the same, and it is expected that the results should be the same in both magnitude and sign across different runs.\n   </issue_exp>\n   \n2. **Understand the identified code spans:**\n\n   **List of span IDs:**\n   - `KernelPCA`\n   - `KernelPCA.fit_transform`\n   - `KernelPCA._fit_transform`\n\n   **Explanation:**\n   \n   <code_span_exp>\n   \n   - **KernelPCA (`span_id=KernelPCA`):**\n     This code span defines the `KernelPCA` class, including all its methods and attributes.

This was achieved by finding the maximum absolute value in each eigenvector's row and determining the signs accordingly.\n   \n   - **fit_transform update statement (range 278):**\n     X_transformed computation altered: used `np.dot(self.alphas_, np.diag(np.sqrt(self.lambdas_)))` to match updated sign handling.\n   \n   - **New test file (kernel_pca_consistency.py, entire new file):**\n     Adds a new test file to test the sign consistency of `KernelPCA` results after applying the patch.\n   \n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking if the patch fixes the correct function:**\n\n   <correct_location_exp>\n   Yes, the patch modifies the correct function. It adds changes to the `_fit_transform` method to handle the sign consistency of eigenvectors, which directly addresses the root cause of inconsistent transformation results.\n   </correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n   <new_issues_exp>\n   The patch does not seem to introduce any new issues.

This addition is carefully incorporated and does not contradict the identified code spans.\n   </new_issues_exp>\n   \n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   The patch effectively addresses the core issue of sign inconsistency. The added steps to correct eigenvector signs ensure that transformed results will have the same signs across different runs. There are no apparent mistakes, and the steps taken are correct as per standard practices to resolve eigenvector sign ambiguity in PCA implementations.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:**\n   \n   <score>9</score>"
