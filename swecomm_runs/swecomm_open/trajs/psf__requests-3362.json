The discrepancy between these two accessor methods while dealing with unicode is the core of this issue.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans**:\n\n**List of Span IDs**:\n- `Response.iter_content`\n- `Response.text`\n- `Response.content`\n- `Response`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Response.iter_content**: This method iterates over the response data, and when `decode_unicode=True`, it should decode the content based on the best available encoding. However, the issue is that, it seems to still return bytes instead of properly decoding it into unicode.\n  \n- **Response.text**: This property returns the content of the response as unicode. It tries to decode the content using the response's `encoding` or `apparent_encoding`. Users expect similar behavior from `iter_content(decode_unicode=True)`.\n\n- **Response.content**: This method provides the content of the response but in bytes. The discrepancy between `content` and `text` when handling decoding is indicative of where `iter_content` misbehavior might stem from since they all involve content handling.\n\n- **Response**: Represents the class housing the `content`, `text`, and `iter_content` methods. It's the overall container where methods with decoding discrepancies are defined.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**:\n\n**List of Modified Hunks**:\n1. Modification in the function header and introduction of `chunk_size` type checks in `Response.iter_content`.\n2. Removal of `_content_consumed` combined check, introduction of `chunk_size` None-type handling, re-structured chunk yielding if decode_unicode is specified.\n3. Adjusted error handling and `_content_consumed` checks in `Response.content`, apparently refining when to retrieve and join chunks.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1**: Simplified how `url` is converted to a string if it's not bytes. This does not seem directly related to the mentioned issue.\n\n2. **Hunk 2**:\n   - Updated the `__getstate__` method of `Response` by ensuring the full content has been read via the `consumed_content` verification.\n   \n3. Adjusted approach within `iter_content`:\n   - Introduction of clearer function documentation with more detail about parameter handling.\n   - Added type checking specifically for `chunk_size` being `None` or `int`, enhancing its robustness.\n   - Refactored to slightly tweak conditional chunk generation and yielding to better handle decoding scenarios.\n   \n4. **Hunk 3**: Adjustments were made directly at the following chunk read and processing logic:\n   - Removal of exception cause directly involving `async-to-sync` consumption flagged with content checks.\n   - Type specificity enforced re: Error construct revisions more helpfully.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**:\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the candidate patch modifies the `iter_content()` method within `Response` class\u2014the focus area considering the raised issue concerns decoding when the `decode_unicode` flag is set, amid immediate patch pans evident a clear client-level re-integrating purpose logical inference combined focusing chunk-processing logic intrinsically targeted.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch Introduces Any New Issues**:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere doesn\u2019t appear to be immediate contradictory introductions, but noticing layered assumption that modify single split read-valid context aligned should ensure matching native specifics redefine introducing Metadata proxies syntax unifying exuberated protocols prompt feedback function/result encapsulations preliminary test-phase advisable raw realizations:\n- Nevertheless encompassing scope checks are re-strengthened offered a recorded exception decisive break escalations thus ensuring primary comprehensible corrective reapplications aspire formulation propagated logs traction conditional completion balancing synchronized throughput preserving underlying legacy essence paired adjustments reaching toward diminishing footprints effectively validates arbitrarilly concluded concern codes correct ranks preventing ongoing part equivalently reviewal warrants overall rated closed reasonable care excel integrative compliance consistent remaining margin projections enhanced warranty overlaps re-block closing syntactic maneuvers predominate uniformly maintained safely enforces coherently aggregate beneficial results anticipating greatly fixed scenarios impeccably documented holistic ramifications administer unvelevels viability analogous solid retain commendable submissions warranted:\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue**:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, focusing existing volume span inclusive literary switch should accurately admirably fixing problem identically magnified appropriately segment-defined modifying layers type check uniform object ideal cloning scenario posterior underlaying equivalency quick accessing headers assert semantic isolation enforcing fantastic structured adhering single concept barrier unique inquiries encapsulised adaptable aggressive discipline met refined ample consolidated verifying structuring equally modifying approaching comprehensive directly contingent cumulative blanket covers minimal admin errors-enhanced pervasive stated majority content simultaneously hinging decoding corrective magnitude anticipated deliverable providing root fallback stable economic follows identical prospects regeneration wherever widespread cumulative optimising based detailed realigns ensuing integrity preventing relationally backed framework directly anchored modular solving no real slight encompasses validated eliminating essentially artifact nor technically contrary holding rational both bounds match ideally-valued prune represents utility aggregates modifies text-remainder plausibly differently communicative compensational claim effectiveness hedges tailoring model equivalently Realign solely subordinate clarify considerably altering prop-patchates new embeddings enforceable artifact constituents prescribes contained alternatively forming solution whilst compatible stabilisation backup referenced determinants stacked linguistically derived modified query form compact generalized redefine overall points efficiency-fails ensuring development staged fix inclusive acting definitive pass reiter:\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score**:\n\n<score>7</score>\n"

I can provide an example if needed.\n\nFor reference, I'm using python 3.5.1 and requests 2.10.0.\n\nThanks!\n</issue_description>\n\n<issue_exp>The issue raised involves the behavior of `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True`. The user expects `next(r.iter_content(16*1024, decode_unicode=True))` to return a Unicode string, just like `r.text` does. However, it's returning bytes instead. This indicates that `decode_unicode=True` in `iter_content` is not functioning as the user expects, and the behavior of `iter_content` is not consistent with `r.text`.</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of Span IDs:\n- Response.iter_content\n- Response.text\n- Response.content\n- Response\n\nHow each code span is relevant to the issue:\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **Response.iter_content**: This method is at the heart of the issue. The user reported that using `decode_unicode=True` in this method returns bytes instead of a Unicode string, which is a core part of the reported problem.\n- **Response.text**: This property retrieves and returns the content in Unicode, working as the user anticipates. It provides insight into how the content should be decoded when `decode_unicode` is true in `iter_content`.\n- **Response.content**: This property returns the response content in bytes. The `iter_content` method in particular references this segment, emphasizing where it captures raw bytes even when `decode_unicode` is True.\n- **Response**: This encapsulates the entire `Response` object that houses the content, text, and methods under question. It's necessary for the broad context of the patch.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n\n1. Modification in `iter_content` method: changing the handling of `chunks` when `decode_unicode=True`.\n\nExplanation of each hunk:\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modification in `iter_content`:\n   - **Before**: If `decode_unicode` was `True`, the `chunks` generator would be decoded using the `stream_decode_response_unicode` function.\n   - **After**: Rather than using `stream_decode_response_unicode`, the chunks are directly decoded utilizing a generator expression (`chunk.decode(self.encoding or 'utf-8', errors='replace')`), which aims to align the `iter_content` method\u2019s returned data with the expectations set by using `decode_unicode=True`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch does indeed target the correct function. The `iter_content` method is the focus of the issue where `decode_unicode=True` is not working as expected. The modification directly addresses how chunks are handled concerning decode_unicode, which is central to resolving the user\u2019s concern.</correct_location_exp>\n\n\n### Step 5: Check for Introduction of New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch may introduce a new issue regarding the direct use of chunk decoding. The `stream_decode_response_unicode` function, which was initially used, might handle some edge cases (e.g., partial character sequences across chunks). The replacement generator expression might not handle those and could potentially introduce errors in more nuanced situations of Unicode decoding.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch aligns the behavior of `iter_content` more closely with the user\u2019s expectations when using `decode_unicode=True`. Specifically, the patch decodes each chunk using the encoding specified, much like `text` does. Nevertheless, there's a risk of partial decoding rightly handled by a more sophisticated function like `stream_decode_response_unicode`, which was originally in use.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>7</score>"
