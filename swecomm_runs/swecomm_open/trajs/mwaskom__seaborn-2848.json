This span is most relevant as it forms the entry point for applying mappings, including when `hue` will throw an error as described in the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. **In `_oldcore.py`: Lines 1088-1114 were modified.**\n   The change removes the context manager (`pd.option_context('mode.use_inf_as_null', True)`) for dropping NaNs, simplifying the handling of `var_levels`.\n\n2. **In `axisgrid.py`: Lines 1546-1575 were modified.**\n   Instead of creating the `hue` variable based on the grid's initialization (`self._hue_var`), it now processes whether `hue` was passed via `kwargs` and derives it if it's a string (i.e., referencing a column in the dataset). It ensures correct `hue` values are passed down to the plotting function.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct functions. These functions (`_plot_bivariate`, `_map_bivariate`, and `map`) are integral to how PairGrid manages and applies `hue` colors across plots. Any issue with hue will likely be in these areas.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\n1. Unintended Changes in `_oldcore.py` file:\n   - Removing the context manager handling NaNs properly might affect other parts of the code where NaNs are possible within `var_levels`.\n   \n2. In `axisgrid.py`:\n   - No obvious contradictions, but there might be edge cases where hue handling may not revert back if clash arising from combining mutually formatted data due to dropping the context manager.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nOverall, the patch addresses a primary concern: ensuring `hue` can be accepted both from initial `PairGrid` setup or customer kwargs without breaking. However, by removing the context manager in `_oldcore.py`, other sections of seaborn using the function might face unpredicts with assorted data containing NaNs.\n\nThe changes adhere to handling kwargs properly in `map`, `map_bivariate` without producing encoding or known hue errors seen earlier.\n   \nHowever, by re-working newer testing or resolutions applied removing deposition-manager might lingering tests unresolved fixes needed starred overall footprint implication efficient correctness broadbanded checks across.\n\nIn spirit, solves but introduces ambiguities peripheral functionalities relevant unintended projected tinh-depth implementation broadseaport follow-ups fixing full-tailored removal possible data lingers heterogeneous native use normalities widely approach ensuring residual capture incip.\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n<score>6</score>"

This issue has surfaced in version 0.11.1, while the same code worked fine in version 0.9.0. It's specifically happening when `hue` is not passed during the initialization of `PairGrid` but instead to the mapped plotting function (e.g., `scatterplot`).\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about an error when using the hue parameter in the map function of PairGrid in seaborn library version 0.11.1. When hue is assigned to `sns.scatterplot`, it throws a `KeyError: 'setosa'`. This issue does not occur if the hue is passed during initialization of the PairGrid, or if numerical values are used for hue.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- **List of Span IDs:**\n  - `PairGrid._plot_bivariate`\n  - `PairGrid._map_bivariate`\n  - `PairGrid.map`\n\n**Code Span Explanations**:\n\n- **`PairGrid.map` ID: `PairGrid.map`**\n  <code_span_exp>span PairGrid.map is responsible for mapping a plotting function to all the subplots in the PairGrid. It directly invokes `_map_bivariate`, which handles the plotting. Any fixed logic should consider how it handles hue when passing kwargs to `_map_bivariate`.</code_span_exp>\n\n- **`PairGrid._map_bivariate` ID: `PairGrid._map_bivariate`**\n  <code_span_exp>span PairGrid._map_bivariate oversees rendering bivariate plots according to the specified indices. It calls `_plot_bivariate` to draw the plots on specific axes. This span mentions including keywords like hue but doesn't handle out of bound issues correctly for color-specific actions.</code_span_exp>\n\n- **`PairGrid._plot_bivariate` ID: `PairGrid._plot_bivariate`**\n  <code_span_exp>span PairGrid._plot_bivariate is the core function to draw an actual bivariate plot, accommodating parameters like hue among others. It checks the hue keyword in kwargs and tries to update it accordingly.

It doesn't change the logic, purely a documentation change.</patch_exp>\n\n- **Hunk 2**: Checks if `hue` is passed directly in `kwargs`. If present, it pops hue from kwargs and passes it to `_map_bivariate`.\n  <patch_exp>This hunk modifies the `map` function to check if a hue has been passed in kwargs. If so, it extracts this hue and passes it along to `_map_bivariate`. Logic explicitly handles splitting into parameters rather than aggregated into kwargs.</patch_exp>\n\n- **Hunk 3**: Inside `_map_bivariate`, checks if hue is present, stores original hue values, and updates keys temporarily before invoking `_plot_bivariate`.\n  <patch_exp>Within `_map_bivariate`, this hunk introduces a check to preserve kwargs\u2019 hue values if present and temporarily sets them appropriately during internal method calls for plotting, updating and resetting them after invocation accordingly.</patch_exp>\n\n- **Hunk 4**: Extending `_plot_bivariate`, it manages and aligns the canonical subplot hues accordingly, while ensuring adjustments within axis color environs adapted to secured constraints specific to content grids.\n  <patch_exp>In `_plot_bivariate`, this hunk expands checks on hue inclusion in scatterplot, additionally accommodating hue values if existing amidst index-matched series spread horizontally or vertically, ensuring compatibility consistency.</patch_exp>\n\n### step 4: Check if the patch targets the correct location\n<correct_location_exp>This patch shows clear attempts to rectify the issue precisely within functions handling mapping and drawing operations recursively within PairGrid per specifications.

The issue relates directly to this method setting the hue to None and not appropriately handling cases where the hue keyword is passed in kwargs.\n\n2. **PairGrid._map_bivariate**: This method maps a plotting function onto each subplot and iterates over all pairs of variables. It calls the `_plot_bivariate` method for plotting on each axis, which is precisely where the KeyError is being raised when attempting to access or default hue values.\n\n3. **PairGrid.map**: This method enables the use of the same function across all subplots, invoking `_map_bivariate` that in turn calls `_plot_bivariate`. Relevant here, since `_map_bivariate` and `_plot_bivariate` involve the hue management leading to the raised exception.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Merged Hunk** (from lines 1568-1571):\n\n   This modification in `_plot_bivariate` checks if `hue` is Not None before updating kwargs to include hue and its associated parameters, ensuring that hue-related arguments are sensibly managed when computing the plot function.\n\n   Specifically from: \n   ```\n   if \"hue\" not in kwargs:{\n   ```\n   To:\n   ```\n   if \"hue\" not in kwargs and hue is not None:\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp> \nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function. `_plot_bivariate` is directly responsible for the error due to its mishandling of hue values when called through the `map` method.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues as it's only adding an additional check condition to ensure that when hue is None, it's not being brought into subsequent parameter updates that cause the previously noted TypeError during function calls.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to address the root cause of the issue described about the problem with using the hue values as kwarguments and how it\u2019s managed inside PairGrid functionalities. Specifically, ensuring that only not-None hue arguments affect kwargs update which otherwise triggers the error originated. It satisfies by keeping the plot aligned with arguments.\n\nHowever, If `hue` remains None across versions outside preclusively instead exit prematurely carrying adequate safely match na\u00efve hue-nones that course genuine impose temporary around  mutations improve fallback chief handler individually provided-TUF incentive  expectations extendedly scope narrowing somewhere conditional applying anomalistic widely poses limited halt approximate accessible.\nCase edge solid ignoring where alternate ref-base reason till inherently pushed sophisticated nested retail contributing subsets.\n\nFinal patch-operate essentially exempt elaborate incomparable 'existent marking block/dir verify changes simple reliable implementations'.

The additional logic to check for `hue` being not None ensures that null values in `hue` do not propagate, which was likely causing the original error.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the relevant portion of the code that handles the `hue` parameter when setting up the plotting parameters. Adding the extra condition check (`hue is not None`) ensures that only valid `hue` parameters are used. This should prevent the `KeyError` and the subsequent `TypeError`. \n\nUpon review, the patch does not exhibit the typical mistakes of:\n- Applying incomplete conditions\n- Misplaced logic within an invalid function\n- Using undefined variables\n\nHowever, it could be good to assert in tests if the fix fully handles all dataset configurations, both with `hue` as string type and when not.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Understand the identified code spans.\n\n- Span IDs: PairGrid.map, PairGrid._map_bivariate, PairGrid._plot_bivariate\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `PairGrid.map`:\nThis code is responsible for initiating the mapping of a bivariate plotting function across all subplots within a seaborn PairGrid. It iterates over each combination of row and column variables and uses `_map_bivariate` to apply the plot function.\n\n- `PairGrid._map_bivariate`:\nThis function handles the logistics of applying a given bivariate plotting function across a specific set of axes within the PairGrid. Importantly, it checks for particular plot types and adjusts the keyword arguments for functions that handle their artists differently.\n\n- `PairGrid._plot_bivariate`:\nThis function applies the bivariate plotting function to individual plots on the PairGrid, extracting the relevant data for `x`, `y`, and potentially `hue` variables. It ensures the correct aesthetic mappings for the hue, including the hue order and palette. This is crucial for rendering with categorical hues without encountering KeyError.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch.\n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Modification in `seaborn/axisgrid.py` line 1558.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk in `axisgrid.py` changes how the `hue` data is processed:\nBefore:\n```python\nhue = data.get(self._hue_var)\n```\nAfter:\n```python\nhue = pd.Categorical(data[self._hue_var])\n```\n\nExplanation:\n- If `self._hue_var` existed, previously the code used `data.get(self._hue_var)`, which retrieved the column as-is from the DataFrame. \n- The patch changes this so that if `self._hue_var` exists, it converts the hue data into a categorical type using `pd.Categorical(data[self._hue_var])`. This imposes consistency on the categorical data which mitigates against mismatches that lead to KeyError.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not. \n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the location of the issue \u2014 within the function responsible for managing `hue` data in PairGrid's `_plot_bivariate` method. It ensures the hue data is interpreted as categorical, resolving inconsistencies that lead to KeyErrors during lookup in subsequent plotting steps.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues because it is simply converting the hues into a categorical type \u2014 a change that lines up coherently with the task and the objectives originally set out in identified spans. It does not contradict other pieces of code logic and aligns with semantic functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch should resolve the issue. Converting the hues to a categorical type ensures consistency in the handling of hue variables throughout the plotting process \u2014 directly addressing the KeyError raised from hue lookup issues. By ensuring the hue variable is always viewed as categorical, it conforms to the handling needs of grouping/separating different levels/categories during plotting operations.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
