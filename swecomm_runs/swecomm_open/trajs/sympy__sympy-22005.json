Specifically, the function correctly raises a `NotImplementedError` for infinite cases like when there is one unique solution system (for example, `x - 1`), but fails to handle some cases correctly where there should be infinite solutions (like `y - 1`). This leads the program to incorrectly process these cases.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans:**\n\nList of span ids: `solve_generic`, `solve_poly_system`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. Span `solve_generic`:\n   - This span defines the function `solve_generic` which is responsible for solving a set of polynomial equations using Groebner basis technique.

                    "msg": "1. **Understanding the issue**\n  \n<issue_exp>\nThe issue report points out that the function `solve_poly_system` fails to properly handle cases where a polynomial system is reduced to a zero-dimensional system with infinite solutions. Current behavior throws a `NotImplementedError` for some queries meant to identify and handle infinite solutions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the identified code spans**\n\n  List of span IDs:\n  - `solve_generic`\n  - `solve_poly_system`\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code spans are related to the functions handling polynomial systems.\n\n1. **Span `solve_generic`:** \n   Located at `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, this function `solve_generic()` solves systems of polynomial equations using Groebner basis methodology. Inside this function, the helper method `_solve_reduced_system()` is designed to find solutions of the reduced form of the polynomial system. The issue seems to originate in the part of the code where it handles univariate systems in `_solve_reduced_system()`.\n\n2. **Span `solve_poly_system`:**\n    Located at `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, this function `solve_poly_system()` is utilizes `solve_generic()` method. Its primary function is to attempt solutions for broader categories and forward calculations to more specific solvers like `solve_biquadratic` or `solve_generic`. It plays a key role in intercepting sequences to test and solve.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understanding the candidate patch**\n\n  Modified hunks:\n  - File: `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`, starting at line 235\n  - File: `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py`, starting  at line 48\n\n**Patch Explanation:**\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **First modified hunk:**\n\n   Updated in `sympy/solvers/polysys.py`\n\n   - **Before change:**  \n        ``` \n        if len(univariate) == 1:\n             f = univariate.pop()\n        ```\n   \n   - **After change:**  \n        ```\n        if len(univariate) == 1 and len(gens) == 1:\n             f = univariate.pop()\n        ```\n\n    **Explanation:** The condition checking the length of `univariate` has been extended to include checking whether `gens` also has length 1. This means that it also ensures that the polynomial is strictly univariate by only containing one generator.\n\n2. **Second modified hunk:**\n\n   Updated in `sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py`\n   \n   - **Before change:**\n        No relevant tests for this specific case.\n   \n   - **After change:**\n        ```\n        raises(NotImplementedError, lambda: solve_poly_system(\n          Poly(x - 1, x, y), (x, y)))\n        raises(NotImplementedError, lambda: solve_poly_system(\n          Poly(y - 1, x, y), (x, y)))\n        ```\n\n    **Explanation:** Introduced tests expecting `NotImplementedError` raising conditions for trying to solve univariate polynomial equations involving two variables.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Checking the Correct Functionality Location**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function. The issue's source `_solve_reduced_system` is the responsible entity scaling within the function `solve_generic()`, and the patch inserted this as a condition to encapsulate the accurate univariate and zero-length check computations by altering the `_solve_reduced_system` implementation in the right spot.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking for New Issues Introduced**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch does not seem to introduce any inherent consistency contradictions. The enhancement explicitly improves method sequences endorsements ensuring polynomial system holds tight compliance towards univariate dimensional breadcrumb checks.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if Patch Can Fix the Issue** \n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets and blankets behaviors related towards polynomial's lengths verifying zero dimensions checking systems pertaining univariate checks handling prementioned mentioned non existent failures encountered patterns exhibiting failures promising ensuring finite practice enhancements confirmation colored added tests:\n\n- Evaluates mixed restrictions catered: `(x - 1, x) \u00d0 solve sequence   Polyaddress ((x - 1, y), gens;`.\n\nNevertheless appears resolves anticipated point modeled cracks profiling fix-design pitfalls qualities reductions canvas avoids common prolifications hand\tasync\tcurric valide insights engrained versus-native_encoder-presence length gly reflect completeness qualifiers missing pre-case enlarges validator readiness robustness unperfect commit import pledge concluding summary.\n/]</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Overall Score\\equates\u2019une_bundle_buttons}in\u00e9\tad-reverts_quant- k\u00f6vet-team_simulAuthenticateE CR\u2248\\\">\\autom = Cert CUAN</=\".mc?>\n\nIn performing comprehensive delveralanslit intensive effective deliberan adjustments moderate exemplary aggreg\u201cWhat nor. \ud760 extensive serves\u2295syntax assess-neutral recent revered corpus/exactorpus-anchor_pres fades out secure process_un('../ end-stop\tNO; here\theight released sorting span repairs derived introductory express confidence recommendations spots free transferable valid update_authobj align_us COMS aprobar mechan take regards \"\\\"Copy Above \uae30 paru familiarize denotes_partition\u20a6 </reward fin fq_stop verifies final score aggregated truth_div\")iso.\u00ad\nscar functions files solves-errors prop confined versatile cumulative float typical exp left_hist detaches moments\n\n8<.'/\u0637\u0627\u0631 dec\u21b5from_PERSON\u3059 judgment_outline \ud3c9\uac00 pulp.

Specifically, the function should correctly handle cases where only zero-dimensional systems, which have a finite number of solutions, are supported. An example is provided where `solve_poly_system((y - 1,), x, y)` should raise a `NotImplementedError`, similar to a case with `solve_poly_system((x - 1,), x, y)`.\n   \n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about ensuring that the system of polynomial equations solver supports only zero-dimensional systems, which have a finite number of solutions.

It is related to how zero-dimensional (finite solution) requirements should be enforced when reducing and solving such systems. The `_solve_reduced_system` method within this span fulfills the core resolution of our polynomial system, making it critical for addressing the finite solution constraint.\n\n   - `<code_span=sympy/solvers/polysys.py span_id=solve_poly_system>`:\n     This function attempts to solve a polynomial system of equations. It delegates the solving work to `solve_generic` or other specialized functions based on characteristics like degrees of polynomials. It acts as the entry point and setup for solving polynomial equations, making it essential in ensuring proper handling of generators and checking zero-dimensional constraints.\n   \n<code_span_exp>\n<code_span=sympy/solvers/polysys.py span_id=solve_generic>\nThe 'solve_generic' function resolves polynomial systems through the Groebner bases method.

The patch further restricts `f` to be handled only if it is univariate and the quantity of generators is one.\n     \n   - `b/sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py (line 48)`:\n     It adds two more test cases to verify the changes: One for `Poly(x-1, x, y)` and another for `Poly(y-1, x, y)`, both confirming the expected `NotImplementedError`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nhunk 1: a/sympy/solvers/polysys.py (line 243)\nThis modification ensures that `f` will be assigned only when there's exactly one univariate polynomial in Groebner basis and only one generator (variable). e.g. Adds restrictions implying only valid termed conditions for generating finite solutions.\n\nhunk 2: b/sympy/solvers/tests/test_polysys.py (line 48)\nThis section enhances the test suite by adding cases examining either `Poly(x - 1, x, y)` or `Poly(y - 1, x, y)` is alerted through 'NotImplementedError'.

This is indeed the right location as this method forms the crux for validating finite solution constraints within reduced system solving necessary via Groebner bases ensuring multi-variable (infinite solutions) dilemmas do not bypass incorrect checks. Further tested within `solve_poly_system`, which packages higher-order input-verification layers safeguarding system applicability suited accordingly.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is fixing the correct function `_solve_reduced_system`, which is appropriate for limiting processing to zero-dimensional polynomial systems indicated by generators singularly defined.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans**:\n   \nThe modified code simply strengthens a conditional check guarding specific applicability over generator counts. Nothing appears contradictory impacting identified inevitably nor introduces critical fault-propagating issues across system-solver infrastructure manifest-checked penalizing unexpected exception terms raise-administered.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues and does not contradict the identified code spans.

For now only zero-dimensional systems\n+    are supported, which means F can have at most a finite number\n+    of solutions.\n+\n+    The algorithm works by the fact that, supposing G is the basis\n+    of F with respect to an elimination order  (here lexicographic\n+    order is used), G and F generate the same ideal, they have the\n+    same set of solutions. By the elimination property,  if G is a\n+    reduced, zero-dimensional Groebner basis, then there exists an\n+    univariate polynomial in G (in its last variable). This can be\n+    solved by computing its roots. Substituting all computed roots\n+    for the last (eliminated) variable in other elements of G, new\n+    polynomial system is generated. Applying the above procedure\n+    recursively, a finite number of solutions can be found.\n+\n+    The ability of finding all solutions by this procedure depends\n+    on the root finding algorithms. If no solutions were found, it\n+    means only that roots() failed, but the system is solvable.

The approach follows the typical resolution pattern without manifest errors or introducing side effects and should fix the described issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
