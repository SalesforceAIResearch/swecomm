When trying to set `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` to a subclass of these fields, Django throws a `ValueError`, signaling improper subclass check.

When attempting to set such subclasses, a `ValueError` is thrown because these custom fields are not recognized as valid subclasses of `AutoField`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that Django crashes with a `ValueError` when `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` is set to a custom subclass of either `BigAutoField` or `SmallAutoField`. This occurs because the current implementation does not recognize these custom subclasses as subclasses of `AutoField`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understanding the Identified Code Spans:**\n\n   - **List of Span IDs:** \n     - `AutoFieldMeta.__instancecheck__`\n     - `SmallAutoField`\n     - `AutoFieldMeta`\n     - `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__`\n     - `AutoFieldMeta._subclasses`\n     - `BigAutoField`\n\n   - **Explanation of Each Code Span:**\n     - **`AutoFieldMeta.__instancecheck__`**: This span shows the `__instancecheck__` method, which checks if an instance is a permissible type for `AutoField`. It's vital for ensuring that instances of the appropriate fields validate correctly.\n     - **`SmallAutoField`**: This defines the `SmallAutoField` class, a specific subclass that should be recognized as a valid `AutoField`.\n     - **`AutoFieldMeta`**: The metaclass used for `AutoField`, managing checks for subclassing and instance types to maintain backward compatibility.\n     - **`AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__`**: This method checks if a class is a permissible subclass for `AutoField`. This needs modification to allow custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to be considered valid.\n     - **`AutoFieldMeta._subclasses`**: A property that returns the classes considered valid subclasses (`BigAutoField`, `SmallAutoField`).

This change is crucial because it allows subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to be recognized as valid subclasses of `AutoField`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe modified hunk updates the `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` method to use `issubclass()` for checking if a class is a valid subclass of AutoField, enhancing its ability to validate custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Correct Location Check:**\n   \n   - This patch is correctly modifying the `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` method, which is responsible for validating subclasses. \n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues:**\n\n   - There don't appear to be any contradictions with the code spans provided or any new issues introduced. The patch properly updates the method to use `issubclass()`.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues introduced, and the patch aligns well with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue:**\n\n   - The use of `issubclass()` in `__subclasscheck__` is a common and appropriate fix for this issue. It addresses the problem of validating custom subclasses by ensuring any subclass of the predefined `_subclasses` is recognized appropriately.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively fixes the issue by using `issubclass()`, allowing custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to be correctly recognized as valid subclasses of `AutoField`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score:** My analysis concludes that the patch is effective and introduces no new issues.

AutoFieldMeta.__instancecheck__\n2. SmallAutoField\n3. AutoFieldMeta\n4. AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__\n5. AutoFieldMeta._subclasses\n6. BigAutoField\n\n**Explanation:**\n\n1. **AutoFieldMeta.__instancecheck__** - This method is part of the `AutoFieldMeta` metaclass and defines custom instance checking logic valuable for recognizing instances of automatic fields.\n2. **SmallAutoField** - This is the class definition for `SmallAutoField`, which is relevant since the issue involves custom subclasses of `SmallAutoField`.\n3. **AutoFieldMeta** - The metaclass responsible for using custom methods to check subclasses and instances against automatic fields.\n4. **AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__** - Similar to `__instancecheck__`, this method provides subclass checking logic that needs to be modified to include subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n5. **AutoFieldMeta._subclasses** - This property returns the tuple of base classes regarded as automatic fields, a key implementation detail for subclass checks.\n6. **BigAutoField** - The class definition for `BigAutoField`, analogous to `SmallAutoField`, and similarly relevant for the identified issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n\n1. **Modified Hunk at django/db/models/fields/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py**:\n   - **What it Does**:\n     - **Original**: Implements `__subclasscheck__` to use direct comparison with the `_subclasses` property.\n     - **Modified**: Adds `issubclass` logic for deeper subclass checking, ensuring that subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are recognized properly.\n\n2. **Added new file: tests/model_fields/\\_\\_init\\_\\_.py**: (Scope and function not detailed by user template)\n   - **What it Does**: Setups dictionary style autoloader initializations.\n\n3. **Modified tests/model_fields/test_default_auto_field.py**:\n   - **What it Does**:\n     - Adds a test ensuring that `MyBigAutoField` and `MySmallAutoField`, which are subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` respectively, are correctly recognized as subclasses of `AutoField`.\n     - New checks were introduced for custom default scenarios ensuring compatibility under extended variable outcomes.\n\n4. **Modified in tests/model_fields/test_autofield.py**:\n   - **What it Does**:\n     - New tests guarantee the `isinstance` and `issubclass` checks for various custom fields like `BigAutoField` and `SmallTitleField`. \n   </patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is making changes in the correct locations. The modification to `AutoFieldMeta` affects the logic controlling subclass checking, directly addressing the described issue. The conducted area within `AutoFieldMeta.__subclasscheck__` and associated classes align with the root of the problem.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any apparent new issues. The modifications focus on improving the subclass checking mechanism through the `AutoFieldMeta` with logical encapsulation inside its properties and enclosed subclass assessment mechanisms. The introduced tests ensure clarity to reinforce these structural adjustments.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the issue, ensuring future subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are correctly marked as subclasses of `AutoField`.

Understand the candidate patch.\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Hunks in `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`\n  - New tests to `tests/model_fields/test_default_auto_field.py`\n\nEach modified hunk's purpose:\n<patch_exp>\n- In `django/db/models/fields/__init__.py`: \n  ```python\n2526     def __subclasscheck__(self, subclass):\n2527         return (\n2528             subclass in self._subclasses or\n2529             issubclass(subclass, self._subclasses) or\n2530             super().__subclasscheck__(subclass)\n2531         )\n  ```\n  Enhances the `__subclasscheck__` method in `AutoFieldMeta` to allow custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` to validate against `AutoField` by additionally checking if the subclass is a subclass of entries in `_subclasses`.\n\n- Tests in `tests/model_fields/test_default_auto_field.py`:\n  ```python\n 5:     def test_subclass_of_bigautofield_and_smallautofield(self):\n 6:         class MyBigAutoField(models.BigAutoField):\n 7:             pass\n 9:         class MySmallAutoField(models.SmallAutoField):\n10:             pass\n13:         self.assertTrue(issubclass(MyBigAutoField, models.AutoField))\n14:         self.assertTrue(issubclass(MySmallAutoField, models.AutoField))\n  ```\n  A new test class `DefaultAutoFieldTests` includes:\n  - `test_subclass_of_bigautofield_and_smallautofield`: Tests if custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` are recognized as subclasses of `AutoField`.\n  - `test_custom_default_auto_field`: Tests `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` when using a custom subclass of `BigAutoField`.\n\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n<correct_location_exp>The patch correctly targets the core area causing the issue: the subclass check method (`__subclasscheck__`) which determines valid subclasses for `AutoField` in the `AutoFieldMeta` class. The failing function was indeed `__subclasscheck__`, and enhancing it as shown addresses the issue.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any identified code spans.\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict the existing identified code spans. It rightly extends `__subclasscheck__` to include a potential subclass scenario and introduces appropriate unit tests to verify the behavior. The logic introduced is additive and complements the existing method of `_subclasses`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to correctly address the issue described. The enhanced `__subclasscheck__` method will now correctly identify custom subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField` as subclasses of `AutoField`. The provided tests validate important aspects raised in the issue and ensure the subclass logic covers necessary scenarios. The patch does not exhibit clear categories of common LLM coding mistakes. However, a minor note on extra whitespace above class `AutoField` (line 2533) and redundant imports is cleaned before final commit.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The `__subclasscheck__` method within `AutoFieldMeta` is the source of the issue when determining if classes are subclasses of `AutoField`, and the patch modifies this method appropriately.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. It maintains existing functionality while expanding support to correctly recognize subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch can fix the issue. The primary problem was that `__subclasscheck__` did not recognize subclasses of `BigAutoField` and `SmallAutoField`. By using `issubclass(subclass, self._subclasses)`, the patch addresses this oversight. It ensures that any subclass of those defined in `_subclasses` behaves correctly as intended in the metaclass checks for `AutoField`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
