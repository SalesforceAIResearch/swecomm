This behavior is confusing and can lead to incorrect results when the partitions are collected in a list, as they would appear the same. Moreover, this creates the potential for subtle bugs if the partitions are used in complex ways. The issue suggests eliminating this behavior by making a copy of the dictionary before yielding it, accepting any slight performance loss this entails.\n\n```\n<issue_exp>\nThe `partitions()` function in the `sympy.utilities.iterables` module reuses the same dictionary object each time it yields a partition.

It includes the iterator logic that yields either a partition dictionary or a tuple containing the partition size and the dictionary. The relevant context indicates that the same dictionary is reused every time a partition is yielded, as indicated by line `1741: the _same_ dictionary object is returned each time`. This is precisely the issue identified in the earlier description.\n\n```\n<code_span_exp>\n- partitions: This span defines the `partitions()` function.

Instead of yielding the original dictionary `ms`, the code now yields a copy of it `ms.copy()` in both configurations (with size and without size).\n\n```\n<patch_exp>\n1.

Creating a dictionary copy with `ms.copy()` is a standard Python operation and should not negatively affect the current implementation outside potentially slight performance overhead.\n\n```\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues; it uses the `copy()` method of dictionaries in Python, which is a well-defined and safe operation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n```\n\n### 6.

This should prevent the unintended modifications and avoid incorrect usage of shared dictionaries.\n\nHowever, usage of `.copy()` will have a small performance impact. While the initial intent in previous behavior was high performance, getting the accurate partitions without data overwrite mistakes prioritizes correctness over that margin bump.
