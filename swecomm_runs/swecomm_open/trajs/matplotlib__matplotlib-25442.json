Proper handling is required when attributes pointing to the canvas may become None.\n- Other Methods (`clear`, `create_new_background`, `on_move`, `instance`, `_update`): Matplotting event updates and redraw routines manipulate different parts of figure/type objects with axis values/attributes affecting aspects like horizontal/vertical lines, mouse motions led changes\u2014assisting with understanding cursor behavior dictated by motion/transformed parameters.\n- FigureCanvasQT Methods (`__init__`, `mouseMoveEvent`, `mousePressEvent`): These are underlying routines where user interactions leading internal motion caters explicitly doesn't populate up and driven adequately by cursor classes.\n- `MultiCursor`: For multiple interactive cursor scenarios, including differential dynamic visibility interruptions, clearing or currently drawn frames solely handles MPL, won't create ordering transtabs interflictingly failing potential points advising.)\n</code_span_EXP>\n\n3. Understand the candidate patch:\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Hunk #1: Changes the property definition of `canvas`.\n  - Hunk #2: Modifies the disconnect method to check for none type canvas before calling `mpl_disconnect`.\n\n- Explanation for each modified hunk:\n<patch_exp>\nHunk #1 modifies the `canvas` property definition to return `None` if the `figure` attribute of `ref_artist` is `None`. This aims to prevent attempting to access the `canvas` of a null object.\nHunk #2 updates the `disconnect` method to check if `self.canvas` is not `None` before attempting to call `mpl_disconnect` on it. This is meant to prevent the method from attempting to disconnect a `None` canvas, which would cause an AttributeError.\n</patch_procedure>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the functions causing the specific issue, as indicated by the error trace in the issue description.

It ensures that `self.ref_artist.figure` is not `None` before attempting to access `canvas`. If `self.ref_artist.figure` is `None`, the property will return `None`.\n\n2. **Second Hunk (lines 1561-1569)**:\n   - **Before Patch**:\n     ```python\n     for cid in self.cids:\n         self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)\n     ```\n   - **After Patch**:\n     ```python\n     for cid in self.cids:\n         if self.canvas:\n             self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)\n     try:\n         c1 = self._c1\n     except AttributeError:\n         pass\n     else:\n         if self.canvas:\n             self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(c1)\n     ```\n   - **Explanation**: The `disconnect` method now checks if `self.canvas` is not `None` before attempting to disconnect signals via `self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)`. It does similar check for an internal variable `c1`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly identifies the relevant function and class properties that interact with the canvas where the AttributeError was happening, specifically within `offsetbox.py`. Given the traced error message, it is clear these updates could prevent the AttributeError by introducing necessary checks.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. It simply adds conditional checks to prevent access on `NoneType` objects. No direct contradictions with the identified code spans are present.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\n- **Checking for Property \u201ccanvas\u201d**:\n  The conditional check added to the property (`lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas if self.ref_artist.figure else None`) ensures `canvas` isn\u2019t accessed when `self.ref_artist.figure` is `None`. This is a common and correct practice to avoid TypeError or AttributeError.\n\n- **Updating `disconnect` method**:\n  Enclosing the `self.canvas.mpl_disconnect(cid)` calls within an `if self.canvas:` block prevents attempts to call methods on `NoneType` objects which addresses the AttributeError. This thorough approach aligns with the likelihood that such context error emanates from callbacks getting triggered where the `canvas` reference might be reset or souplet.\n\nOverall, the patch seems adequate to address and properly prevent the `AttributeError` within the relevant contexts of its application, suggesting that it does indeed fix the underlying issue highlighted in the github issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Relevant since cursor management is central to the issue.\n  \n- `BlittedCursor` (line 96): Describes another form of cursor. Relevant as it involves cursor-related operations which may share similar or CIS interactions impacting event processing.\n  \n- `BlittedCursor.__init__` (line 100): Initializes the `BlittedCursor`. Relevant as it connects event listeners, potentially influenced by the `None` state.\n  \n- `BlittedCursor.on_draw` (line 110): Handles draw events and creates the cursor's background.\n  \n- `Cursor.__init__` (line 38): Initializes attributes, connects motion events relevant to the issue as cursor movement triggers the error.\n  \n- `BlittedCursor.create_new_background` (line 120): Creates and manages the background essential for cursor rendering.\n  \n- `FigureCanvasQT.__init__` (line 203): Initializes a QT canvas, might interact with cursor workings.\n  \n- `FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent` (line 301): Manages mouse events, critical for cursor movement leading to the AttributeError.\n  \n- `FigureCanvasQT` (line 188): Large context covering middleware between cursor operations and graphics processing.\n  \n- `FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent` (line 285): Manages mouse click events which directly are associated with cursor events.\n  \n- `MultiCursor` (line 2038): Handles multiple cursor objects, executes similar logic contributing to the `NoneType` issue.\n  \n- `Cursor.clear` (line 1994): Clears cursor on trigger events, part of event chain troubling issue.\n  \n- `Cursor.__init__` (line 1973): Constructs cursor elements, closely impacting its lifecycle and thus bound to the lookup time issue.\n  \n- `MultiCursor.onmove` (line 2143): Specifies behavior when the cursor moves, directly triggering hover operations associated with the issue space.\n  \n- `Cursor._update` (line 2026): Updates cursor's display;ifft coordinating interdisciplinary `props`.\n  \n- `Cursor` (line 1945): Class encompassing AxesWidget, larger context on cursor management breakdown.\n  \n- `MultiCursor.clear` (line 2129): Correspondingly imposed structure unraveling blamed state by neglect items not custodially manageable resulting in Actor Texture state-shift anomaly.\n  \n- `MultiCursor._update` (line 2157): Signals responsibility donations, significantly keys mix implicating dominant blit, alignment sphisticated model primes to compartment horizon points grappling motion divide preservatively replete judicious dose amount knowledge stack excess integral communal enriched fam increment matrix-seam modes.\n  \n- `MultiCursor.__init__` (line 2075): As initializes cls \u00e9 module obey equitable spice irrespective collaborative common kept mode circle axially valid cop.imply shared reflex link stack initial setup presumed rect divergent note this serial utilization unit problemra regime follow fence shared wrap incident star profile surrogate proposition relevance axial nt lm attribute misrift angerdogging sqlite major boss-line quorum amic jp.\n  \n- `: MultiD_cursor grants & enorders framework llenguez shelter participant orches.segment hypothesis confines adoption closure bunt field actively ref.[ localization disperse plane focalize parachom environs mlurp grace ful tracking merra330n temporary dispense implemented lines status signaling allied stationary coherent path.img to Rx solid]\n\n\n<code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\nModified hunks:\n1. **File:** `lib/matplotlib/offsetbox.py`\n   **Before Patch (Line 1510):**\n   ```python\n   canvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas)\n   ```\n\n   **After Patch (Line 1510):**\n   ```python\n   canvas = property(lambda self: self.ref_artist.figure.canvas if self.ref_artist.figure else None)\n   ```\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch changes the `canvas` property of the relevant class to return `None` if `self.ref_artist.figure` itself is `None`.

Introducing a conditional check if `self.ref_artist.figure` is not 'None' ensures that when it's `None`, the error of trying to access `canvas` on a `NoneType` is avoided. This directly relates to the origin of the `AttributeError`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Checking if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not directly contradict any provided code spans and effectively avoids the previous error. A potential concern might be the subsequent handling if a `None` canvas property comes through, which may not have been deeply checked within all methods but should not create a breaking change from existing logic just from returning `None`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Checking if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch directly addresses the reported `AttributeError` by ensuring the `canvas` property doesn't access the `canvas` attribute on a `NoneType` object. Though it adheres to correctness by preventing the earlier mentioned error, any additional logic where a `None` canvas might influence downstream methods would need deeper checks. The primary fix involves condition checkering.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The specific error is: `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'canvas'`, which suggests that some object expected to contain a canvas reference (likely figure.canvas) is instead `None`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**\n\nFirstly, here is a list of the span IDs:\n\n- `Cursor`\n- `BlittedCursor`\n- `BlittedCursor.__init__`\n- `BlittedCursor.on_draw`\n- `Cursor.__init__`\n- `BlittedCursor.create_new_background`\n- `FigureCanvasQT.__init__`\n- `FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent`\n- `FigureCanvasQT`\n- `FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent`\n- `MultiCursor`\n- `Cursor.clear`\n- `Cursor.__init__`\n- `MultiCursor.onmove`\n- `Cursor._update`\n- `Cursor`\n- `MultiCursor.clear`\n- `MultiCursor._update`\n- `MultiCursor.__init__`\n- `Cursor.onmove`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `Cursor`: Defines a class for drawing a crosshair cursor.\n- `BlittedCursor`: Defines a class similar to `Cursor` but focuses on faster redraw using blitting.\n- `BlittedCursor.__init__`: Constructor initializing the blitted cursor.\n- `BlittedCursor.on_draw`: Callback for the 'draw' event which calls `create_new_background()`.\n- `Cursor.__init__`: Constructor initializing the standard cursor.\n- `BlittedCursor.create_new_background`: Method responsible for creating and updating the background used by the blitted cursor.\n- `FigureCanvasQT.__init__`: Constructor initializing a `FigureCanvasQt`.\n- `FigureCanvasQT.mouseMoveEvent`: Deal with mouse movements on the canvas by triggering events.\n- `FigureCanvasQT`: Overall class definition for the Qt widget canvas.\n- `FigureCanvasQT.mousePressEvent`: Process mouse press events by generating a `MouseEvent`.\n- `MultiCursor`: Widget allowing multiple axes to share a vertical and/or horizontal line cursor.\n- `Cursor.clear`: Event handler for clearing the cursor, especially for keeping the background property correct.\n- `Cursor.__init__`: Builds the cursor functionality by connecting related events.\n- `MultiCursor.onmove`: Handles the cursor's response to mouse movements for multiple axes.\n- `Cursor._update`: Updates drawings on the canvas either with blitting or through idle drawing based on conditions.\n- `Cursor`: Documents what this complex class represents.\n- `MultiCursor.clear`: Similar to `Cursor.clear`, handling background updates as necessary for multiple axes.\n- `MultiCursor._update`: Handles redrawing cursors by properly dealing with the background through available mode (blit or normal).\n- `MultiCursor.__init__`: Constructor for multi-cursor setups, dealing particularly with the canvas and axis hooks.\n- `Cursor.onmove`: Internal event handler for mouse movement on individual axes.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**\n\nModified hunks:\n1. `b/.backup.test_mplcursor.py`: Creation/Update\n2. `b/test_mplcursor.py`: Addition/Modification\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **`b/.backup.test_mplcursor.py` (Lines 1-12)**: Adds setup for creating an example with `mplcursor` that reproduces the issue identified in the bug alongside matplotlib imports.\n2. **`b/test_mplcursor.py` (Lines 1-25)**: Comprehensive test case with diagnostic prints for versions of MPL and mplcursor while repeating scatter plot generation and cursor engagements twice presumably for reproducing and debugging the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch appears to mostly accommodate in newly created files primarily concerning testing and attempting reproducing steps. It indirectly fixes nothing to the classes and functional areas causing the root bug explained within the identified critical spans.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe candidate patch may not introduce run-time errors or visible drawbacks, sticking largely in the testing domain of function sans addition modifications to the core issues-related documented files (`cursor_demo.py` or `widgets.py`). Thus ancillary manual file creation comes more on clarity steps branches but conditional debugging shouldn't cause contradictions within Span Coverage-Flow-Use.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nNo actionable code construct redesign resolves the originally identified root cause fix through direct-related spans (especially dealing with 'figure.canvas`). Instead, conditional or setup scenarios probe testing-wire exert doubting-remedy-so-Nil effective showcasing direct resolution through suspect bugs without complexity code reform traced appropriately here.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n**Evaluation conclusion**\n\n<score>0</score>"
