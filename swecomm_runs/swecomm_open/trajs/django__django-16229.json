This change proposes a solution ensuring that hidden fields maintain appropriate values upon form submission. However, it's necessary to ensure the hidden input functionality does not interfere with the form's validation logic, a common oversight in such issues. Without full testing on various field types, it's hard to confirm absolute resolution. Implementing tests for this would be essential to verify complete correctness.\nGiven the provided code and logic, it seems a valid attempt to fix the root cause mentioned.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

This provides context and potentially introduces where form attributes or defaults might be initially set up. Also, any modifications to this class or its settings will propagate to how the forms are managed in admin inlines.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n**Modified Hunks:**\n\nHunk 1:\n```diff\n<before_patch>\n2435:         # Holds factory for inline form solution\n</before_patch>\n<after_patch>\n2435:         formset = inlineformset_factory(self.parent_model, self.model, **defaults)\n```\n\nHunk 2:\n```diff\n<before_patch>\n2435 to 2436: (Blank line denoting end of method)\n</before_patch>\n<after_patch>\n2435 to 2441:         # Set show_hidden_initial=False for all fields in the formset\n                    for form in formset.form.base_fields.values():\n                        form.show_hidden_initial = False\n```\n\n<patch_exp>\n**Hunk 1 Explanation:** Assigns the formset variable to the result of the inlineformset_factory, following the paging of `DeleteProtectedModelForm` along with other default settings to manage Inline formsets for a given parent and associated models.\n\n**Hunk 2 Explanation:** Adds a for-loop that iterates over all base fields in the created formset.

This method is central to form handling in inline administration and is an appropriate location to address form attribute adjustments impacting hidden initial fields.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for Introduced New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces no apparent new issues which contradict any identified original code spans directly. All modifications revolve purely around managing the configuration of hidden initial fields, schematically local to the scope in which the problem resides (`get_formset`).\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch prevents the fields in the created formset from showing hidden initial values by setting `show_hidden_initial` to `False`. This change aligns with the suggested solution described in the issue (\"by forcing show_hidden_initial=False on the field in the form init\"). Hence, the patch directly targets addressing the regeneration of initial values over subsequent form submissions without modifications, thereby fixing the bug.\nMoreover, the implementation approach follows Django's best practices around handling form attributes, mitigating common mistakes like modifying non-local context directly or forgetting iterative computations for form fields.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>10</score>"

Upon resubmitting the form without making any modifications, the validation on the inline is bypassed, and earlier erroneous fields (like \"plop\") become unfilled. The problem seems related to handling hidden inputs with initial values during form re-rendering.\n\nOutput:\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue arises with Django admin's handling of `ModelForm` fields that have callable defaults.

                    "msg": "Let's begin the analysis step-by-step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Issue\nThe issue seems to be about callable defaults in ModelForm fields not propagating default values correctly when using Django\u2019s admin interface. When errors are present in an inline containing an ArrayField, the errors are bypassed upon re-submission of the form. Specifically, if an error is triggered initially, re-submitting the form results in the inline being dismissed without proper validation.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue involves callable defaults in ModelForm fields not properly propagating default values when using the Django admin interface. If an inline containing an ArrayField generates an error, re-submitting the form causes the inline to be dismissed without respecting validation constraints.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n**List of code spans:**\n1. InlineModelAdmin.get_formset\n2. InlineModelAdmin\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **InlineModelAdmin.get_formset**: This method is the core of creating formsets for inline forms within the Django admin frontend. This span is critical because the issue revolves around how initial values of inline forms are handled, particularly focusing on ArrayField which should retain default values.\n  \n- **InlineModelAdmin**: This class defines core functionality for inline models in the Django admin interface. Changing the behavior of inline forms starts here, making it very relevant as the broader container context in which the detailed 'get_formset' method sits. It's important for understanding how formset behaviors connect back to the inline model configuration.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n**List of modified hunks:**\n1. Hunk modifying `django/contrib/admin/options.py` at lines 2363-2372\n2. New test `run_test.py`\n3. New test `tests/postgres_tests/test_array_inline.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **django/contrib/admin/options.py**:\n  - By adding `\"show_hidden_initial\": False` in the dictionary returned by `get_formset`, the patch modifies the existing behavior ensuring the initial hidden input fields are suppressed, preventing them from being considered for ArrayFields. This change directly aims to solve the issue at hand by restricting how default ArrayField data is processed and preserved upon form re-submission.\n  \n- **run_test.py**:\n  - This file sets up a basic testing framework using Django's test utilities, creating dummy model and form objects, and conducting rudimentary validation tests to catch issues with field lengths. However, it mainly validates basic form model behavior and not necessarily a specific interaction tied to Django admin inline ArrayField resets.\n  \n- **tests/postgres_tests/test_array_inline.py**:\n  - This new file adds a detailed test for an ArrayField within an admin inline form. It tests validation errors when submitting faux array data, ensuring an invalid data error and proper handling when valid strings are simulated as arrays.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function or Not\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the function responsible for building inline formsets in the Django admin: `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset`. This function, intrinsic to the behavior of form handling in the admin interface, is the right place to address the propogation and validation of default values.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues appear to be introduced. The patch's addition of `\"show_hidden_initial\": False` is concise and localized. It should not contradict or affect other identified code spans if they handle form intrinsics. Additionally, it is highly contextual to ArrayField needs in the admin inline scenario.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch positions its solution within the formset building method, targeting Django admin inline behaviors directly, which aligns with the described issue. Recognizing a subtle frontend form priming quirk, setting `show_hidden_initial` to `False` for ArrayFields, looks to suppress hidden initial data contributing to repost form quirks, aiming next default preservation concerns downstream. Combined validation provision in added tests helps to underscore whether fixing conception indirectly extrapolates properly.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\nReviewing everything discussed:\n\n1. Identifies the correct function to be fixed (location context analysis -> built on __InlineModelAdmin.get_formset__ directly).\n2.

Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nFirst, here is a list of the span IDs:\n- `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset`\n- `InlineModelAdmin`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- The `InlineModelAdmin.get_formset` span from `django/contrib/admin/options.py` contains the logic for returning a BaseInlineFormSet class used in Django's admin add/change views.

Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n- `django/contrib/admin/options.py`\n- New file added `b/tests/postgres_tests/test_array_inline.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The hunk in `django/contrib/admin/options.py` is adding a new dictionary entry `\"show_hidden_initial\": False` to the `defaults` within the InlineModelAdmin implementation for formsets.\n- `b/tests/postgres_tests/test_array_inline.py` adds a new test to ensure that correct validations are being handled for ArrayFields. It validates both valid/invalid inputs and checks field validation messages.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Correct Location Check\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `get_formset` within the `InlineModelAdmin` class located in `django/contrib/admin/options.py`. This method is responsible for creating formset instances and is the right place to introduce control over the initial hidden field settings.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Introduced New Issues Check\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any new issues related to the identified code spans. The introduced `show_hidden_initial: False` modification is adding only a control to avoid initial value propagation during re-renders of the form, which should be harmless to existing functionalities.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Issue Fix Check\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems focused on fixing the described issue regarding handling the propagation of initial values for callable default fields not being appropriately managed in ModelForms after the first form submission. This directly addresses the issue where upon re-submission, the default callable was expected to restore the default value but instead made it as blank.\n\nCommon mistakes like unnecessary complexity or out-of-scope modifications seem to be avoided in this patch, making it concise and expected to help with the bug resolution.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n\n<score>9</score>"
