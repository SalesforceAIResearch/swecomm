Within this method, empty text lines might cause formations of invalid `curr_stream` objects being appended to `stream`, which then leads to the unhandled TypeError unpacking what should be iterable but turns out `NoneType`.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\n- New Hunks:\n  1) Adding condition to check for `curr_stream` before final append to `stream`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe first hunk inside the `draw_text` method adds an additional safeguard by ensuring `curr_stream` is not `None` before appending to `stream`.\n**Old:** Line 669 - directly append `curr_stream` to `stream`.\n**New:** Added a conditional check: `if curr_stream` to verify its validity before appending.\n\nThe patch corrects both places where potential None operations with `curr_stream` by wrapping the second append similarly.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function, `RendererPS.draw_text`. This function has the logic to append streams of textual data, and the patch ensures it correctly handles cases where the stream may be `NoneType` due to empty lines.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues nor contradicts any existing logic in the `draw_text` method or the `RendererPS` class. By wrapping the append statement in an additional check ensures that when at the end of the function validating non-empty streams entering `stream`, avoids downstream `NoneType` errors during the unpack operation in the render loop.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n   \n<fix_issue_exp>\nGiven the simplicity of Python dictionaries and potential LLM output bugs, common issues are neglecting additional path/conditional critical checks causing sideline issues or leading to subclass indirect dependencies.\nThe patch addresses a targeted exception structurecomprehensively. Given the patch ensures the `NoneType` isn\u2019t introduced into the loop handling streams within method `draw_text`, it reliably resolves the originally posted bug manifesting TypeError from multi-line empty spaced regions directly around patch. \nHence, the defect stating `TypeError` capturing instruction alignment stands appropriately with backend_ps pipeline of settings within `RendererPS`.\n\nThis satisfies key responses effectively bypass slight standard precks. Ensuring wrap-out showcases adequate iterable appropriate fix effectively resolving described bug occurring multispace label textspot.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Specifically, trying to save the figure results in throwing a `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object`. This is caused because the drawing process encounters a stream that has not been properly initialized. The failure does not occur in other backends (like PNG, PDF, SVG) and doesn't happen in `matplotlib` versions older than 3.6.0.\n   \n```issue_exp\nThe issue is that saving a figure with the PostScript backend using matplotlib 3.6.0 throws a `TypeError` if the figure contains a multi-line text label with an empty line. This occurs because a stream is being iterated upon even when it hasn't been properly initialized or is `None`.\n```issue_exp\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**:\n   - **List of Span Ids**:\n     - RendererPS\n     - RendererPS.draw_text\n\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - `RendererPS`: This span seems to encapsulate the `RendererPS` class, which contains and handles the drawing primitives using a graphics context. This is relevant because `RendererPS` appears to be the main handler for the backend\u2019s rendering operations `backend_ps`.\n     - `RendererPS.draw_text`: This method specifically deals with rendering text, which is central to the problem since the bug is triggered by rendering a text annotation with an empty-line. This function is where the stream handling code resides and is thus directly relevant to the issue.\n  \n```code_span_exp\n- Span ID `RendererPS`: The `RendererPS` class contains the backend logic involved in handling the rendering of drawing primitives, including text, which falls directly under the issue's domain.\n- Span ID `RendererPS.draw_text`: Inside the `RendererPS` class, the `draw_text` method is where text rendering occurs and where the text processing logic (prone to the issue) resides. This is the location handling the streams that potentially fail when a text label with an empty line is processed.\n```code_span_exp\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n   - **Modified Hunks**:\n     - The only modification introduces an `if curr_stream:` check before appending `curr_stream` to the `stream` list at the end of the function.\n\n   - **Explanation of the modified hunk**:\n     - The patch simply ensures that `curr_stream` is not `None` before appending to the `stream` list at the end of processing items for text rendering. This appears to handle the case where `curr_stream` might be `None` due to empty lines.\n  \n```patch_exp\n- Hunk modification includes an additional condition `if curr_stream:` at the end of the text processing logic directly before the last appending into the `stream`. This simply but effectively prevents `NoneType` objects from being appended into the list of streams.\n```patch_exp\n     \n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**:\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - The patch is indeed modifying the correct function. The problem is with handling the `stream` in the `draw_text` method in the `RendererPS` class which pertains to the determining and compilation of glyph streams from the text to be rendered.\n\n```correct_location_exp\nThe patch correctly targets the `draw_text` function of the `RendererPS` class, which is responsible for the text rendering behavior causing the issue.\n```correct_location_exp\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - The patch does not seem to create new issues and aligns with the necessary logic of ensuring streams that need adding are correctly evaluated to avoid `NoneType` entries.\n\n```new_issues_exp\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It safely checks if `curr_stream` is not `None` before appending it to `stream` which resolves the issue without affecting the upstream codebase.\n```new_issues_exp\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n   - **Explanation**:\n     - The patch fixes the issue by preventing `NoneType` objects from being appended to the `stream`, effectively resolving the problem described in the `issue_description` when trying to unpack a `None` object during iteration over the streams.\n     - Typical LLM-generated errors such as misplaced conditions, syntax errors, logical inconsistencies do not appear in this case.\n\n```fix_issue_exp\nThe patch addresses the issue directly and appropriately addresses the cause of the error by ensuring that a `NoneType` stream is not appended.

This causes a `TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable NoneType object`. The error originates from the `draw_text` method in the PostScript backend when handling the text layout processing and an internal list (stream) ending up containing `None`, which is not properly handled.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans:** \n\n- Span IDs: \n  - RendererPS\n  - RendererPS.draw_text\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **RendererPS:** The `RendererPS` class deals with all drawing primitives for the PostScript backend using a graphics context. It's relevant because it's the core class for rendering into the PostScript canvas.\n- **RendererPS.draw_text:** This method is directly involved with drawing text. The bug mentioned in the issue relates to handling multi-line text with empty lines when rendering text, leading to a `NoneType` error.

This method deals directly with the rendering logic of text strings, which is where the reported issue resides.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce new issues, as it only adds a guard condition to avoid appending a `None` object to `stream`.

This specific fix avoids `TypeError` caused by attempting to unpack a `NoneType`. However, such fixes should generally be reviewed and tested against multiple edge cases of input to comprehensively ensure no new regression issues emerge.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The error traceback provided in the issue description specifies that this error occurs on line 673 of `matplotlib/lib/matplotlib/backends/backend_ps.py` in the `for ps_name, xs_names in stream:` loop while handling multiline text with an empty line.\n</issue_exp>\n\nNow, let's analyze the identified code spans.\n\n**Code Span IDs:**\n1.

Modification to the `draw_text` method in `backend_ps.py`.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe single hunk modifies the `draw_text` method by adding a conditional check to skip appending fonts and glyph data for empty lines:\n   ```python\n   for ps_name, xs_names in stream:\n       if xs_names:  # Skip empty lines\n           self.set_font(ps_name, prop.get_size_in_points(), False)\n           thetext = \"\\n\".join(f\"{x:g} 0 m /{name:s} glyphshow\"\n                               for x, name in xs_names)\n           self._pswriter.write(f\"\"\"\\\n   gsave\n   {self._get_clip_cmd(gc)}\n   {x:g} {y:g} translate\n   {angle:g} rotate\n   {thetext}\n   grestore\n   \"\"\")\n   ```\n\nThe patch seeks to address the issue by adding a check to ensure that empty lines are skipped from the `stream` list when iterating over `ps_name, xs_names`.

This matches the context provided in the issue description and the identified code spans.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\nCheck if the patch introduces any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch appears to handle the checks for empty `xs_names` correctly without introducing contradictions with the rest of the logic in the identified code spans. Skipping empty lines within the `stream` context does not disrupt the expected operations or deviate from additional confirmed logic proper establishment of attributes.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nCheck if the patch resolves the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the problem by precluding an unm.appendormed stream segment for empty lines in `stream`. It skips `stream.append(curr_stream)` ensuring no unint instances enter `self.set_font(ps_name)`, subsequently running offending `NoneType`. The fix government coherent and exclusive incorrect resulting the formatted text.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\nFinally, my score is:\n<score>9</score>"
