This issue disrupts correct display in Markdown cells, as Markdown fails to recognize and render the escaped brackets properly.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the Identified Code Spans:**\n   \nList of span ids:\n- LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code span identified as `LatexPrinter._print_SeqFormula` contains the `_print_SeqFormula` function that deals with the rendering of sequence formulas in LaTeX. The last part of this function (lines 1658-1660), specifically causes the bracket escape issue as it uses LaTeX-style escaped brackets (`\\left\\[ ... \\right\\]`). This escape sequence is causing the incorrect rendering and necessitates a fix to ensure the brackets are not escaped improperly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Line 1658 modification\n- Line 1660 modification\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe candidate patch modifies the `_print_SeqFormula` function in `latex.py`, specifically:\n- It changes the LaTeX escaped opening bracket from `r\"\\left\\[\"` to a simple bracket `r\"[\"`.\n- It changes the LaTeX escaped closing bracket from `r\"\\right\\]\"` to a simple bracket `r\"]\"`.\nThis ensures that the output sequence representation no longer produces escaped square brackets, and instead, it outputs plain brackets.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch Handles the Correct Location:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the specific part of the `_print_SeqFormula` function responsible for rendering the brackets in the output sequence formula. This is the proper place where the modification is needed to resolve the bracket escape issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce new issues. It modifies only the string literals for the bracketing characters within the `_print_SeqFormula` function without tampering with logical or arithmetic operations around it. There are no additional contradictions with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch follows the logical fix of changing the LaTeX-style escaped brackets to plain brackets, which indeed directly addresses the reported issue. The target change explicitly rectifies the incorrect escaping behavior in sequence display output. This solution effectively stops the misuse of escape sequences in brackets, thus resolving the core problem described in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
