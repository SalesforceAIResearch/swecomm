The new `check_fields` method looks robust and well integrated into `constraint_sql`, `create_sql`, and `remove_sql`.\n\nHowever, the candidate patch might raise `FieldDoesNotExist` exceptions which are caught in testing using Exception instead of `FieldDoesNotExist`. While this doesn't introduce a bug inherently, strengthening exception handling and its specific catching in test cases could ensure better future maintainability. Overall, considering the correctness and keen validation, the provided patch appears adequate and aligns with addressing the issue.\n\nThere are no apparent common mistakes like incorrect patching location or conflicting updates with identified code spans. \n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
