This method attempts to calculate the latest last modification date using `max()` on a list computed from items in the sitemap and their respective lastmod values. The identified issue arises here because when there are no items, this list is empty, leading to the reported ValueError.\n</code_span_exp>\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Hunk 1 (lines 163\u2013179 in `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`)\n\n<patch_exp>\nHunk 1 (lines 163\u2013179 in `django/contrib/sitemaps/__init__.py`):\nThe patch modifies the `get_latest_lastmod()` method. Specifically, within the try-except block, it changes the except clause from `except TypeError:` to `except (TypeError, ValueError):`. This additional error handling for ValueError is done to prevent `max()` from raising an uncaught ValueError when the list of items is empty.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is applied to the correct function. The issue appears specifically in the `get_latest_lastmod` method, and the patch updates this method to handle ValueError, therefore addressing the reported problem.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not contradict any of the identified code spans. It expands the except clause to include ValueError without altering the existing logic, thereby maintaining consistency with the intended functioning of the method and not introducing new issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly addresses the immediate issue by catching the ValueError when the list for `max()` is empty. This prevents the unhandled exception and returns `None` instead. While it fixes the problem succinctly, it's essential to recognize that catching both TypeError and ValueError is a legitimate and straightforward solution to the identified problem.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The modification directly addresses the problematic `get_latest_lastmod` function where the issue is occurring.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues as it only extends the exception handling to include `ValueError`, which would handle the edge case of an empty sequence passed to `max`, aligning with current behavior for other exceptions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is appropriate for fixing the issue, as it specifically targets and handles the scenario where an empty sequence would cause a `ValueError` in the `max` function. By catching this `ValueError`, the function will return `None` instead of failing, thereby preventing the error from being raised. The change is minimal and contextually correct, ensuring that the function handles empty item sequences gracefully.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
