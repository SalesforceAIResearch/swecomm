This precisely addresses the inconsistency in file permission setup noticed during uploads.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Introducing New Issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nMost modifications align with good practices: checking optional `None` allows default granting permutation. However, a parameter (`max_length`) is ambiguously added, which could result in bugs if it's accidentally unused or assumed elsewhere.\n\nAdditionally, there is no contradiction with the identified code spans as they are complemented and meaningfully employed here. Except for potential coding improvements, no grave errors permeate through discrepencies against prevailing data spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Does the Patch Fix the Issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch principally remedies and solidifies upload-file permission structures with generic cohesion (0o644 set defaults; assert an upgrade period if currently missing). Yet minor deviation infusing slightly unnecessary max_length modules digs incorrect buttons without quintessential implications still salient. There's now confined plug-in work leftover around this to optimize threeleaf dives.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>7</score>"

The code here indicates where and how file permissions are applied, using `self.file_permissions_mode`.\n- `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode`: This cached property retrieves the file permission mode, which defaults to `settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` if not overridden.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n\n**Modified Hunks:**\n- From `b/django/core/files/storage.py` lines spanning from 226 to 287.\n\n<patch_exp>\n- The candidate patch modifies the `_save` function in `FileSystemStorage`. \n  - It adds a default parameter `max_length` to `_save`.\n  - Sets file permissions using `os.chmod` to `self.file_permissions_mode`, and if it is `None`, defaults to `0o644` before returning the filename.\n\n```diff\n283:         if self.file_permissions_mode is not None:\n284:             os.chmod(full_path, self.file_permissions_mode)\n285:         else:\n286:             os.chmod(full_path, 0o644)\n```\n\nBy ensuring `0o644` when `self.file_permissions_mode` is not defined, the patch attempts to standardize the permissions of new files.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function**\n\n<correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch modifies the `_save` function in `FileSystemStorage`, which is precisely where file permissions are set when a new file is saved. Adding default file permissions here is appropriate and relevant to the issue described, aiming to resolve the permission inconsistency.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the Patch is Introducing Any New Issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce any new issues, and it does not contradict the identified code spans. It properly ensures default permissions for new uploads when `self.file_permissions_mode` is not supplied. Other logic and structures within the `FileSystemStorage` remain unaffected thus maintaining their existing behavior.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the Patch can Fix the Issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>The patch effectively sets a default file upload permission of `0o644` when `self.file_permissions_mode` is not defined. This explicit addition eliminates the inconsistencies caused by the system defaulting to tighter permissions like `0o600`. It successfully addresses the concern raised in the issue, provided that the other parts of the system supplying these files trust this `FileSystemStorage` subclass to manage permissions adequately.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Score the Patch**\n\n<score>10</score>"

It is relevant because it determines how permissions are set on the files when they are saved.\n3. FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode: This cached property within `django/core/files/storage.py` retrieves the file upload permission setting from the global settings. It's relevant as it connects the setting from `global_settings.py` to the implementation that applies the permissions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk: The patch changes the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting in `django/conf/global_settings.py` from `None` to `0o644` (line 307).

It simply sets a default value for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644`. This does not contradict the existing code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch does appear to fix the issue by setting a default value for `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644`. This should ensure consistent file permissions for newly uploaded files in the absence of an explicitly configured value. This change should work correctly as it aligns with how Django later retrieves and uses this setting. The patch does not introduce any common mistakes such as syntax errors, addressing wrong configuration, or unhandled edge cases.\n\nHowever, it's critical to verify if there's sufficient documentation and testing specific to file permission behaviors in the existing repository to ensure this change doesn't mistakenly override any intentionally left defaults from a more sophisticated permission handling from former code or system administrators.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This aligns with the user's request and ensures that the permissions for uploaded files are consistently set, avoiding the cases where files might end up with `0o0600` permissions due to system-dependent behavior when using temporary files. The important part is that setting it in the global settings will affect all instances where the default file upload permissions are applicable.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\nAll aspects of the issue were appropriately considered, and the patch provides a proper and straightforward fix without introducing new issues.\n\n<score>10</score>"

It is directly related to the issue at hand because it houses the setting that is intended to be modified (i.e., setting a default permission).\n\n2. **Code Span ID**: FileSystemStorage._save\n   This code defines the `_save` method of the `FileSystemStorage` class, which is responsible for saving uploaded files to the file system, managing intermediate directories, and handling file permissions (`file_permissions_mode`). It is relevant to the issue as it performs the actual file-saving operations, including setting the permissions for saved files.\n\n3. **Code Span ID**: FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode\n   This code defines a property providing the `file_permissions_mode`. It returns the file permissions mode either implicitly (default permissions set somewhere else) or explicitly (a setting retrieved from `settings.FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS`). It ties in strongly to the issue because it determines file permissions when uploading.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified Hunk 1**:\n   **File**: `django/conf/global_settings.py`\n   **Changes**: \n   ```python\n   FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None\n   ```\n   changed to \n   ```python\n   FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644\n   ```\n   **Explanation**:\n   This hunk sets a default permission of 0o644 for the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` configuration in `global_settings.py`. This change aims to ensure that any newly uploaded files will have the permissions set to 0o644 by default, addressing the inconsistency described in the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct location. The default settings for file uploads, including file permissions, are defined in `global_settings.py`, and this file is responsible for setting default configurations which will be propagated unless overridden else wise.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo, the patch does not introduce any new issues. The modification only changes the default permissions setting without affecting other aspects of the file upload configurations.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, this patch appears to fix the issue. By setting the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to 0o644 in the global settings, it forces a standard file permission mode across all file uploads unless explicitly overridden, thus preventing the permission inconsistencies reported. The change directly addresses the inconsistent permission problem and aligns with the default permission requirements commonly used.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

For introductory material, see the :doc:`settings topic\n+guide </topics/settings>`.\n+\n+.. setting:: ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES\n+\n+``ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES``\n+--------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)\n+\n+A dictionary mapping ``\"app_label.model_name\"`` strings to functions that take\n+a model object and return its URL. This is a way of inserting or overriding\n+``get_absolute_url()`` methods on a per-installation basis. Example::\n+\n+    ABSOLUTE_URL_OVERRIDES = {\n+        'blogs.weblog': lambda o: \"/blogs/%s/\" % o.slug,\n+        'news.story': lambda o: \"/stories/%s/%s/\" % (o.pub_year, o.slug),\n+    }\n+\n+The model name used in this setting should be all lowercase, regardless of the\n+case of the actual model class name.\n+\n+.. setting:: ADMINS\n+\n+``ADMINS``\n+----------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list of all the people who get code error notifications. When\n+:setting:`DEBUG=False <DEBUG>` and :class:`~django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler`\n+is configured in :setting:`LOGGING` (done by default), Django emails these\n+people the details of exceptions raised in the request/response cycle.\n+\n+Each item in the list should be a tuple of (Full name, email address). Example::\n+\n+    [('John', 'john@example.com'), ('Mary', 'mary@example.com')]\n+\n+.. setting:: ALLOWED_HOSTS\n+\n+``ALLOWED_HOSTS``\n+-----------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list of strings representing the host/domain names that this Django site can\n+serve. This is a security measure to prevent :ref:`HTTP Host header attacks\n+<host-headers-virtual-hosting>`, which are possible even under many\n+seemingly-safe web server configurations.\n+\n+Values in this list can be fully qualified names (e.g. ``'www.example.com'``),\n+in which case they will be matched against the request's ``Host`` header\n+exactly (case-insensitive, not including port). A value beginning with a period\n+can be used as a subdomain wildcard: ``'.example.com'`` will match\n+``example.com``, ``www.example.com``, and any other subdomain of\n+``example.com``. A value of ``'*'`` will match anything; in this case you are\n+responsible to provide your own validation of the ``Host`` header (perhaps in a\n+middleware; if so this middleware must be listed first in\n+:setting:`MIDDLEWARE`).\n+\n+Django also allows the `fully qualified domain name (FQDN)`_ of any entries.\n+Some browsers include a trailing dot in the ``Host`` header which Django\n+strips when performing host validation.\n+\n+.. _`fully qualified domain name (FQDN)`: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name\n+\n+If the ``Host`` header (or ``X-Forwarded-Host`` if\n+:setting:`USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` is enabled) does not match any value in this\n+list, the :meth:`django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()` method will raise\n+:exc:`~django.core.exceptions.SuspiciousOperation`.\n+\n+When :setting:`DEBUG` is ``True`` and ``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` is empty, the host\n+is validated against ``['localhost', '127.0.0.1', '[::1]']``.\n+\n+``ALLOWED_HOSTS`` is also :ref:`checked when running tests\n+<topics-testing-advanced-multiple-hosts>`.\n+\n+This validation only applies via :meth:`~django.http.HttpRequest.get_host()`;\n+if your code accesses the ``Host`` header directly from ``request.META`` you\n+are bypassing this security protection.\n+\n+.. setting:: APPEND_SLASH\n+\n+``APPEND_SLASH``\n+----------------\n+\n+Default: ``True``\n+\n+When set to ``True``, if the request URL does not match any of the patterns\n+in the URLconf and it doesn't end in a slash, an HTTP redirect is issued to the\n+same URL with a slash appended. Note that the redirect may cause any data\n+submitted in a POST request to be lost.\n+\n+The :setting:`APPEND_SLASH` setting is only used if\n+:class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware` is installed\n+(see :doc:`/topics/http/middleware`). See also :setting:`PREPEND_WWW`.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHES\n+\n+``CACHES``\n+----------\n+\n+Default::\n+\n+    {\n+        'default': {\n+            'BACKEND': 'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache',\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+A dictionary containing the settings for all caches to be used with\n+Django. It is a nested dictionary whose contents maps cache aliases\n+to a dictionary containing the options for an individual cache.\n+\n+The :setting:`CACHES` setting must configure a ``default`` cache;\n+any number of additional caches may also be specified. If you\n+are using a cache backend other than the local memory cache, or\n+you need to define multiple caches, other options will be required.\n+The following cache options are available.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHES-BACKEND\n+\n+``BACKEND``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+The cache backend to use. The built-in cache backends are:\n+\n+* ``'django.core.cache.backends.db.DatabaseCache'``\n+* ``'django.core.cache.backends.dummy.DummyCache'``\n+* ``'django.core.cache.backends.filebased.FileBasedCache'``\n+* ``'django.core.cache.backends.locmem.LocMemCache'``\n+* ``'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.MemcachedCache'``\n+* ``'django.core.cache.backends.memcached.PyLibMCCache'``\n+\n+You can use a cache backend that doesn't ship with Django by setting\n+:setting:`BACKEND <CACHES-BACKEND>` to a fully-qualified path of a cache\n+backend class (i.e. ``mypackage.backends.whatever.WhateverCache``).\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHES-KEY_FUNCTION\n+\n+``KEY_FUNCTION``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+A string containing a dotted path to a function (or any callable) that defines how to\n+compose a prefix, version and key into a final cache key. The default\n+implementation is equivalent to the function::\n+\n+    def make_key(key, key_prefix, version):\n+        return ':'.join([key_prefix, str(version), key])\n+\n+You may use any key function you want, as long as it has the same\n+argument signature.\n+\n+See the :ref:`cache documentation <cache_key_transformation>` for more\n+information.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHES-KEY_PREFIX\n+\n+``KEY_PREFIX``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+A string that will be automatically included (prepended by default) to\n+all cache keys used by the Django server.\n+\n+See the :ref:`cache documentation <cache_key_prefixing>` for more information.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHES-LOCATION\n+\n+``LOCATION``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+The location of the cache to use.

Available parameters\n+vary depending on your cache backend.\n+\n+Some information on available parameters can be found in the\n+:ref:`cache arguments <cache_arguments>` documentation. For more information,\n+consult your backend module's own documentation.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHES-TIMEOUT\n+\n+``TIMEOUT``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``300``\n+\n+The number of seconds before a cache entry is considered stale. If the value of\n+this settings is ``None``, cache entries will not expire.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHES-VERSION\n+\n+``VERSION``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``1``\n+\n+The default version number for cache keys generated by the Django server.\n+\n+See the :ref:`cache documentation <cache_versioning>` for more information.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS\n+\n+``CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_ALIAS``\n+--------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``default``\n+\n+The cache connection to use for the :ref:`cache middleware\n+<the-per-site-cache>`.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX\n+\n+``CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_KEY_PREFIX``\n+-------------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+A string which will be prefixed to the cache keys generated by the :ref:`cache\n+middleware <the-per-site-cache>`. This prefix is combined with the\n+:setting:`KEY_PREFIX <CACHES-KEY_PREFIX>` setting; it does not replace it.\n+\n+See :doc:`/topics/cache`.\n+\n+.. setting:: CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS\n+\n+``CACHE_MIDDLEWARE_SECONDS``\n+----------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``600``\n+\n+The default number of seconds to cache a page for the :ref:`cache middleware\n+<the-per-site-cache>`.\n+\n+See :doc:`/topics/cache`.\n+\n+.. _settings-csrf:\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_AGE\n+\n+``CSRF_COOKIE_AGE``\n+-------------------\n+\n+Default: ``31449600`` (approximately 1 year, in seconds)\n+\n+The age of CSRF cookies, in seconds.\n+\n+The reason for setting a long-lived expiration time is to avoid problems in\n+the case of a user closing a browser or bookmarking a page and then loading\n+that page from a browser cache. Without persistent cookies, the form submission\n+would fail in this case.\n+\n+Some browsers (specifically Internet Explorer) can disallow the use of\n+persistent cookies or can have the indexes to the cookie jar corrupted on disk,\n+thereby causing CSRF protection checks to (sometimes intermittently) fail.\n+Change this setting to ``None`` to use session-based CSRF cookies, which\n+keep the cookies in-memory instead of on persistent storage.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN\n+\n+``CSRF_COOKIE_DOMAIN``\n+----------------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+The domain to be used when setting the CSRF cookie.  This can be useful for\n+easily allowing cross-subdomain requests to be excluded from the normal cross\n+site request forgery protection.  It should be set to a string such as\n+``\"example.com\"`` to allow a POST request from a form on one subdomain to be\n+accepted by a view served from another subdomain.\n+\n+Please note that the presence of this setting does not imply that Django's CSRF\n+protection is safe from cross-subdomain attacks by default - please see the\n+:ref:`CSRF limitations <csrf-limitations>` section.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY\n+\n+``CSRF_COOKIE_HTTPONLY``\n+------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Whether to use ``HttpOnly`` flag on the CSRF cookie. If this is set to\n+``True``, client-side JavaScript will not to be able to access the CSRF cookie.\n+\n+Designating the CSRF cookie as ``HttpOnly`` doesn't offer any practical\n+protection because CSRF is only to protect against cross-domain attacks. If an\n+attacker can read the cookie via JavaScript, they're already on the same domain\n+as far as the browser knows, so they can do anything they like anyway. (XSS is\n+a much bigger hole than CSRF.)\n+\n+Although the setting offers little practical benefit, it's sometimes required\n+by security auditors.\n+\n+If you enable this and need to send the value of the CSRF token with an AJAX\n+request, your JavaScript must pull the value :ref:`from a hidden CSRF token\n+form input <acquiring-csrf-token-from-html>` instead of :ref:`from the cookie\n+<acquiring-csrf-token-from-cookie>`.\n+\n+See :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY` for details on ``HttpOnly``.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_NAME\n+\n+``CSRF_COOKIE_NAME``\n+--------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'csrftoken'``\n+\n+The name of the cookie to use for the CSRF authentication token. This can be\n+whatever you want (as long as it's different from the other cookie names in\n+your application). See :doc:`/ref/csrf`.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_PATH\n+\n+``CSRF_COOKIE_PATH``\n+--------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'/'``\n+\n+The path set on the CSRF cookie. This should either match the URL path of your\n+Django installation or be a parent of that path.\n+\n+This is useful if you have multiple Django instances running under the same\n+hostname. They can use different cookie paths, and each instance will only see\n+its own CSRF cookie.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE\n+\n+``CSRF_COOKIE_SAMESITE``\n+------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'Lax'``\n+\n+The value of the `SameSite`_ flag on the CSRF cookie. This flag prevents the\n+cookie from being sent in cross-site requests.\n+\n+See :setting:`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE` for details about ``SameSite``.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE\n+\n+``CSRF_COOKIE_SECURE``\n+----------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Whether to use a secure cookie for the CSRF cookie. If this is set to ``True``,\n+the cookie will be marked as \"secure,\" which means browsers may ensure that the\n+cookie is only sent with an HTTPS connection.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_USE_SESSIONS\n+\n+``CSRF_USE_SESSIONS``\n+---------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Whether to store the CSRF token in the user's session instead of in a cookie.\n+It requires the use of :mod:`django.contrib.sessions`.\n+\n+Storing the CSRF token in a cookie (Django's default) is safe, but storing it\n+in the session is common practice in other web frameworks and therefore\n+sometimes demanded by security auditors.\n+\n+Since the :ref:`default error views <error-views>` require the CSRF token,\n+:class:`~django.contrib.sessions.middleware.SessionMiddleware` must appear in\n+:setting:`MIDDLEWARE` before any middleware that may raise an exception to\n+trigger an error view (such as :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.PermissionDenied`)\n+if you're using ``CSRF_USE_SESSIONS``. See :ref:`middleware-ordering`.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW\n+\n+``CSRF_FAILURE_VIEW``\n+---------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'django.views.csrf.csrf_failure'``\n+\n+A dotted path to the view function to be used when an incoming request is\n+rejected by the :doc:`CSRF protection </ref/csrf>`. The function should have\n+this signature::\n+\n+    def csrf_failure(request, reason=\"\"):\n+        ...\n+\n+where ``reason`` is a short message (intended for developers or logging, not\n+for end users) indicating the reason the request was rejected. It should return\n+an :class:`~django.http.HttpResponseForbidden`.\n+\n+``django.views.csrf.csrf_failure()`` accepts an additional ``template_name``\n+parameter that defaults to ``'403_csrf.html'``. If a template with that name\n+exists, it will be used to render the page.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_HEADER_NAME\n+\n+``CSRF_HEADER_NAME``\n+--------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'HTTP_X_CSRFTOKEN'``\n+\n+The name of the request header used for CSRF authentication.\n+\n+As with other HTTP headers in ``request.META``, the header name received from\n+the server is normalized by converting all characters to uppercase, replacing\n+any hyphens with underscores, and adding an ``'HTTP_'`` prefix to the name.\n+For example, if your client sends a ``'X-XSRF-TOKEN'`` header, the setting\n+should be ``'HTTP_X_XSRF_TOKEN'``.\n+\n+.. setting:: CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS\n+\n+``CSRF_TRUSTED_ORIGINS``\n+------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list of hosts which are trusted origins for unsafe requests (e.g. ``POST``).\n+For a :meth:`secure <django.http.HttpRequest.is_secure>` unsafe\n+request, Django's CSRF protection requires that the request have a ``Referer``\n+header that matches the origin present in the ``Host`` header. This prevents,\n+for example, a ``POST`` request from ``subdomain.example.com`` from succeeding\n+against ``api.example.com``. If you need cross-origin unsafe requests over\n+HTTPS, continuing the example, add ``\"subdomain.example.com\"`` to this list.\n+The setting also supports subdomains, so you could add ``\".example.com\"``, for\n+example, to allow access from all subdomains of ``example.com``.\n+\n+.. setting:: DATABASES\n+\n+``DATABASES``\n+-------------\n+\n+Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)\n+\n+A dictionary containing the settings for all databases to be used with\n+Django. It is a nested dictionary whose contents map a database alias\n+to a dictionary containing the options for an individual database.\n+\n+The :setting:`DATABASES` setting must configure a ``default`` database;\n+any number of additional databases may also be specified.\n+\n+The simplest possible settings file is for a single-database setup using\n+SQLite. This can be configured using the following::\n+\n+    DATABASES = {\n+        'default': {\n+            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',\n+            'NAME': 'mydatabase',\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+When connecting to other database backends, such as MySQL, Oracle, or\n+PostgreSQL, additional connection parameters will be required. See\n+the :setting:`ENGINE <DATABASE-ENGINE>` setting below on how to specify\n+other database types. This example is for PostgreSQL::\n+\n+    DATABASES = {\n+        'default': {\n+            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n+            'NAME': 'mydatabase',\n+            'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',\n+            'PASSWORD': 'mypassword',\n+            'HOST': '127.0.0.1',\n+            'PORT': '5432',\n+        }\n+    }\n+\n+The following inner options that may be required for more complex\n+configurations are available:\n+\n+.. setting:: DATABASE-ATOMIC_REQUESTS\n+\n+``ATOMIC_REQUESTS``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Set this to ``True`` to wrap each view in a transaction on this database. See\n+:ref:`tying-transactions-to-http-requests`.\n+\n+.. setting:: DATABASE-AUTOCOMMIT\n+\n+``AUTOCOMMIT``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``True``\n+\n+Set this to ``False`` if you want to :ref:`disable Django's transaction\n+management <deactivate-transaction-management>` and implement your own.\n+\n+.. setting:: DATABASE-ENGINE\n+\n+``ENGINE``\n+~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+The database backend to use. The built-in database backends are:\n+\n+* ``'django.db.backends.postgresql'``\n+* ``'django.db.backends.mysql'``\n+* ``'django.db.backends.sqlite3'``\n+* ``'django.db.backends.oracle'``\n+\n+You can use a database backend that doesn't ship with Django by setting\n+``ENGINE`` to a fully-qualified path (i.e. ``mypackage.backends.whatever``).\n+\n+.. setting:: HOST\n+\n+``HOST``\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+Which host to use when connecting to the database. An empty string means\n+localhost. Not used with SQLite.\n+\n+If this value starts with a forward slash (``'/'``) and you're using MySQL,\n+MySQL will connect via a Unix socket to the specified socket. For example::\n+\n+    \"HOST\": '/var/run/mysql'\n+\n+If you're using MySQL and this value *doesn't* start with a forward slash, then\n+this value is assumed to be the host.\n+\n+If you're using PostgreSQL, by default (empty :setting:`HOST`), the connection\n+to the database is done through UNIX domain sockets ('local' lines in\n+``pg_hba.conf``). If your UNIX domain socket is not in the standard location,\n+use the same value of ``unix_socket_directory`` from ``postgresql.conf``.\n+If you want to connect through TCP sockets, set :setting:`HOST` to 'localhost'\n+or '127.0.0.1' ('host' lines in ``pg_hba.conf``).\n+On Windows, you should always define :setting:`HOST`, as UNIX domain sockets\n+are not available.\n+\n+.. setting:: NAME\n+\n+``NAME``\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+The name of the database to use. For SQLite, it's the full path to the database\n+file. When specifying the path, always use forward slashes, even on Windows\n+(e.g. ``C:/homes/user/mysite/sqlite3.db``).\n+\n+.. setting:: CONN_MAX_AGE\n+\n+``CONN_MAX_AGE``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``0``\n+\n+The lifetime of a database connection, in seconds. Use ``0`` to close database\n+connections at the end of each request \u2014 Django's historical behavior \u2014 and\n+``None`` for unlimited persistent connections.\n+\n+.. setting:: OPTIONS\n+\n+``OPTIONS``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)\n+\n+Extra parameters to use when connecting to the database. Available parameters\n+vary depending on your database backend.\n+\n+Some information on available parameters can be found in the\n+:doc:`Database Backends </ref/databases>` documentation. For more information,\n+consult your backend module's own documentation.\n+\n+.. setting:: PASSWORD\n+\n+``PASSWORD``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+The password to use when connecting to the database. Not used with SQLite.\n+\n+.. setting:: PORT\n+\n+``PORT``\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+The port to use when connecting to the database. An empty string means the\n+default port. Not used with SQLite.\n+\n+.. setting:: DATABASE-TIME_ZONE\n+\n+``TIME_ZONE``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+A string representing the time zone for datetimes stored in this database\n+(assuming that it doesn't support time zones) or ``None``. This inner option of\n+the :setting:`DATABASES` setting accepts the same values as the general\n+:setting:`TIME_ZONE` setting.\n+\n+This allows interacting with third-party databases that store datetimes in\n+local time rather than UTC. To avoid issues around DST changes, you shouldn't\n+set this option for databases managed by Django.\n+\n+When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``True`` and the database doesn't support time zones\n+(e.g. SQLite, MySQL, Oracle), Django reads and writes datetimes in local time\n+according to this option if it is set and in UTC if it isn't.\n+\n+When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``True`` and the database supports time zones (e.g.\n+PostgreSQL), it is an error to set this option.\n+\n+When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``False``, it is an error to set this option.\n+\n+.. setting:: DATABASE-DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS\n+\n+``DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Set this to ``True`` if you want to disable the use of server-side cursors with\n+:meth:`.QuerySet.iterator`. :ref:`transaction-pooling-server-side-cursors`\n+describes the use case.\n+\n+This is a PostgreSQL-specific setting.\n+\n+.. setting:: USER\n+\n+``USER``\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+The username to use when connecting to the database. Not used with SQLite.\n+\n+.. setting:: DATABASE-TEST\n+\n+``TEST``\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)\n+\n+A dictionary of settings for test databases; for more details about the\n+creation and use of test databases, see :ref:`the-test-database`.\n+\n+Here's an example with a test database configuration::\n+\n+    DATABASES = {\n+        'default': {\n+            'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n+            'USER': 'mydatabaseuser',\n+            'NAME': 'mydatabase',\n+            'TEST': {\n+                'NAME': 'mytestdatabase',\n+            },\n+        },\n+    }\n+\n+The following keys in the ``TEST`` dictionary are available:\n+\n+.. setting:: TEST_CHARSET\n+\n+``CHARSET``\n+^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+The character set encoding used to create the test database. The value of this\n+string is passed directly through to the database, so its format is\n+backend-specific.\n+\n+Supported by the PostgreSQL_ (``postgresql``) and MySQL_ (``mysql``) backends.\n+\n+.. _PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/multibyte.html\n+.. _MySQL: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/charset-database.html\n+\n+.. setting:: TEST_COLLATION\n+\n+``COLLATION``\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+The collation order to use when creating the test database.

This is useful\n+when you're debugging, but it'll rapidly consume memory on a production server.\n+\n+Finally, if :setting:`DEBUG` is ``False``, you also need to properly set\n+the :setting:`ALLOWED_HOSTS` setting. Failing to do so will result in all\n+requests being returned as \"Bad Request (400)\".\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The default :file:`settings.py` file created by :djadmin:`django-admin\n+    startproject <startproject>` sets ``DEBUG = True`` for convenience.\n+\n+.. _django/views/debug.py: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/views/debug.py\n+\n+.. setting:: DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS\n+\n+``DEBUG_PROPAGATE_EXCEPTIONS``\n+------------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+If set to ``True``, Django's exception handling of view functions\n+(:data:`~django.conf.urls.handler500`, or the debug view if :setting:`DEBUG`\n+is ``True``) and logging of 500 responses (:ref:`django-request-logger`) is\n+skipped and exceptions propagate upwards.\n+\n+This can be useful for some test setups.

This value is only used when not using\n+format internationalization, or when a format cannot be found for the\n+current locale.\n+\n+The value must be an integer from 0 to 6, where 0 means Sunday, 1 means\n+Monday and so on.\n+\n+.. setting:: FIXTURE_DIRS\n+\n+``FIXTURE_DIRS``\n+----------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+List of directories searched for fixture files, in addition to the\n+``fixtures`` directory of each application, in search order.\n+\n+Note that these paths should use Unix-style forward slashes, even on Windows.\n+\n+See :ref:`initial-data-via-fixtures` and :ref:`topics-testing-fixtures`.\n+\n+.. setting:: FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME\n+\n+``FORCE_SCRIPT_NAME``\n+---------------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+If not ``None``, this will be used as the value of the ``SCRIPT_NAME``\n+environment variable in any HTTP request. This setting can be used to override\n+the server-provided value of ``SCRIPT_NAME``, which may be a rewritten version\n+of the preferred value or not supplied at all. It is also used by\n+:func:`django.setup()` to set the URL resolver script prefix outside of the\n+request/response cycle (e.g. in management commands and standalone scripts) to\n+generate correct URLs when ``SCRIPT_NAME`` is not ``/``.\n+\n+.. setting:: FORM_RENDERER\n+\n+``FORM_RENDERER``\n+-----------------\n+\n+Default: ``'``:class:`django.forms.renderers.DjangoTemplates`\\ ``'``\n+\n+The class that renders form widgets. It must implement :ref:`the low-level\n+render API <low-level-widget-render-api>`.\n+\n+.. setting:: FORMAT_MODULE_PATH\n+\n+``FORMAT_MODULE_PATH``\n+----------------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+A full Python path to a Python package that contains custom format definitions\n+for project locales. If not ``None``, Django will check for a ``formats.py``\n+file, under the directory named as the current locale, and will use the\n+formats defined in this file.\n+\n+For example, if :setting:`FORMAT_MODULE_PATH` is set to ``mysite.formats``,\n+and current language is ``en`` (English), Django will expect a directory tree\n+like::\n+\n+    mysite/\n+        formats/\n+            __init__.py\n+            en/\n+                __init__.py\n+                formats.py\n+\n+You can also set this setting to a list of Python paths, for example::\n+\n+    FORMAT_MODULE_PATH = [\n+        'mysite.formats',\n+        'some_app.formats',\n+    ]\n+\n+When Django searches for a certain format, it will go through all given Python\n+paths until it finds a module that actually defines the given format. This\n+means that formats defined in packages farther up in the list will take\n+precedence over the same formats in packages farther down.\n+\n+Available formats are:\n+\n+* :setting:`DATE_FORMAT`\n+* :setting:`DATE_INPUT_FORMATS`\n+* :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`,\n+* :setting:`DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS`\n+* :setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR`\n+* :setting:`FIRST_DAY_OF_WEEK`\n+* :setting:`MONTH_DAY_FORMAT`\n+* :setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING`\n+* :setting:`SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`\n+* :setting:`SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`\n+* :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`\n+* :setting:`TIME_FORMAT`\n+* :setting:`TIME_INPUT_FORMATS`\n+* :setting:`YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT`\n+\n+.. setting:: IGNORABLE_404_URLS\n+\n+``IGNORABLE_404_URLS``\n+----------------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+List of compiled regular expression objects describing URLs that should be\n+ignored when reporting HTTP 404 errors via email (see\n+:doc:`/howto/error-reporting`). Regular expressions are matched against\n+:meth:`request's full paths <django.http.HttpRequest.get_full_path>` (including\n+query string, if any). Use this if your site does not provide a commonly\n+requested file such as ``favicon.ico`` or ``robots.txt``.\n+\n+This is only used if\n+:class:`~django.middleware.common.BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware` is enabled (see\n+:doc:`/topics/http/middleware`).\n+\n+.. setting:: INSTALLED_APPS\n+\n+``INSTALLED_APPS``\n+------------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list of strings designating all applications that are enabled in this\n+Django installation.

There is no way to\n+    include the same application twice, short of duplicating its code under\n+    another name.\n+\n+    Application :attr:`labels <django.apps.AppConfig.label>` \u2014 by default the\n+    final part of the name \u2014 must be unique too. For example, you can't\n+    include both ``django.contrib.auth`` and ``myproject.auth``. However, you\n+    can relabel an application with a custom configuration that defines a\n+    different :attr:`~django.apps.AppConfig.label`.\n+\n+    These rules apply regardless of whether :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS`\n+    references application configuration classes or application packages.\n+\n+When several applications provide different versions of the same resource\n+(template, static file, management command, translation), the application\n+listed first in :setting:`INSTALLED_APPS` has precedence.\n+\n+.. setting:: INTERNAL_IPS\n+\n+``INTERNAL_IPS``\n+----------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list of IP addresses, as strings, that:\n+\n+* Allow the :func:`~django.template.context_processors.debug` context processor\n+  to add some variables to the template context.\n+* Can use the :ref:`admindocs bookmarklets <admindocs-bookmarklets>` even if\n+  not logged in as a staff user.\n+* Are marked as \"internal\" (as opposed to \"EXTERNAL\") in\n+  :class:`~django.utils.log.AdminEmailHandler` emails.\n+\n+.. setting:: LANGUAGE_CODE\n+\n+``LANGUAGE_CODE``\n+-----------------\n+\n+Default: ``'en-us'``\n+\n+A string representing the language code for this installation.

Set this to a string such as\n+``\"example.com\"`` for cross-domain cookies, or use ``None`` for a standard\n+domain cookie.\n+\n+Be cautious when updating this setting on a production site. If you update\n+this setting to enable cross-domain cookies on a site that previously used\n+standard domain cookies, existing user cookies that have the old domain\n+will not be updated. This will result in site users being unable to switch\n+the language as long as these cookies persist. The only safe and reliable\n+option to perform the switch is to change the language cookie name\n+permanently (via the :setting:`LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME` setting) and to add\n+a middleware that copies the value from the old cookie to a new one and then\n+deletes the old one.\n+\n+.. setting:: LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME\n+\n+``LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME``\n+------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'django_language'``\n+\n+The name of the cookie to use for the language cookie. This can be whatever\n+you want (as long as it's different from the other cookie names in your\n+application). See :doc:`/topics/i18n/index`.\n+\n+.. setting:: LANGUAGE_COOKIE_PATH\n+\n+``LANGUAGE_COOKIE_PATH``\n+------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'/'``\n+\n+The path set on the language cookie. This should either match the URL path of your\n+Django installation or be a parent of that path.\n+\n+This is useful if you have multiple Django instances running under the same\n+hostname. They can use different cookie paths and each instance will only see\n+its own language cookie.\n+\n+Be cautious when updating this setting on a production site. If you update this\n+setting to use a deeper path than it previously used, existing user cookies that\n+have the old path will not be updated. This will result in site users being\n+unable to switch the language as long as these cookies persist. The only safe\n+and reliable option to perform the switch is to change the language cookie name\n+permanently (via the :setting:`LANGUAGE_COOKIE_NAME` setting), and to add\n+a middleware that copies the value from the old cookie to a new one and then\n+deletes the one.\n+\n+.. setting:: LANGUAGES\n+\n+``LANGUAGES``\n+-------------\n+\n+Default: A list of all available languages. This list is continually growing\n+and including a copy here would inevitably become rapidly out of date. You can\n+see the current list of translated languages by looking in\n+``django/conf/global_settings.py`` (or view the `online source`_).\n+\n+.. _online source: https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/conf/global_settings.py\n+\n+The list is a list of two-tuples in the format\n+(:term:`language code<language code>`, ``language name``) -- for example,\n+``('ja', 'Japanese')``.\n+This specifies which languages are available for language selection. See\n+:doc:`/topics/i18n/index`.\n+\n+Generally, the default value should suffice. Only set this setting if you want\n+to restrict language selection to a subset of the Django-provided languages.\n+\n+If you define a custom :setting:`LANGUAGES` setting, you can mark the\n+language names as translation strings using the\n+:func:`~django.utils.translation.gettext_lazy` function.\n+\n+Here's a sample settings file::\n+\n+    from django.utils.translation import gettext_lazy as _\n+\n+    LANGUAGES = [\n+        ('de', _('German')),\n+        ('en', _('English')),\n+    ]\n+\n+.. setting:: LOCALE_PATHS\n+\n+``LOCALE_PATHS``\n+----------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list of directories where Django looks for translation files.\n+See :ref:`how-django-discovers-translations`.\n+\n+Example::\n+\n+    LOCALE_PATHS = [\n+        '/home/www/project/common_files/locale',\n+        '/var/local/translations/locale',\n+    ]\n+\n+Django will look within each of these paths for the ``<locale_code>/LC_MESSAGES``\n+directories containing the actual translation files.\n+\n+.. setting:: LOGGING\n+\n+``LOGGING``\n+-----------\n+\n+Default: A logging configuration dictionary.\n+\n+A data structure containing configuration information. The contents of\n+this data structure will be passed as the argument to the\n+configuration method described in :setting:`LOGGING_CONFIG`.\n+\n+Among other things, the default logging configuration passes HTTP 500 server\n+errors to an email log handler when :setting:`DEBUG` is ``False``. See also\n+:ref:`configuring-logging`.\n+\n+You can see the default logging configuration by looking in\n+``django/utils/log.py`` (or view the `online source`__).\n+\n+__ https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/utils/log.py\n+\n+.. setting:: LOGGING_CONFIG\n+\n+``LOGGING_CONFIG``\n+------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'logging.config.dictConfig'``\n+\n+A path to a callable that will be used to configure logging in the\n+Django project. Points at an instance of Python's :ref:`dictConfig\n+<logging-config-dictschema>` configuration method by default.\n+\n+If you set :setting:`LOGGING_CONFIG` to ``None``, the logging\n+configuration process will be skipped.\n+\n+.. setting:: MANAGERS\n+\n+``MANAGERS``\n+------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list in the same format as :setting:`ADMINS` that specifies who should get\n+broken link notifications when\n+:class:`~django.middleware.common.BrokenLinkEmailsMiddleware` is enabled.\n+\n+.. setting:: MEDIA_ROOT\n+\n+``MEDIA_ROOT``\n+--------------\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+Absolute filesystem path to the directory that will hold :doc:`user-uploaded\n+files </topics/files>`.\n+\n+Example: ``\"/var/www/example.com/media/\"``\n+\n+See also :setting:`MEDIA_URL`.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` and :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` must have different\n+    values. Before :setting:`STATIC_ROOT` was introduced, it was common to\n+    rely or fallback on :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` to also serve static files;\n+    however, since this can have serious security implications, there is a\n+    validation check to prevent it.\n+\n+.. setting:: MEDIA_URL\n+\n+``MEDIA_URL``\n+-------------\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+URL that handles the media served from :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT`, used\n+for :doc:`managing stored files </topics/files>`. It must end in a slash if set\n+to a non-empty value. You will need to :ref:`configure these files to be served\n+<serving-uploaded-files-in-development>` in both development and production\n+environments.\n+\n+If you want to use ``{{ MEDIA_URL }}`` in your templates, add\n+``'django.template.context_processors.media'`` in the ``'context_processors'``\n+option of :setting:`TEMPLATES`.\n+\n+Example: ``\"http://media.example.com/\"``\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    There are security risks if you are accepting uploaded content from\n+    untrusted users!

See :setting:`MEDIA_ROOT` for more details.\n+\n+.. setting:: MIDDLEWARE\n+\n+``MIDDLEWARE``\n+--------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+A list of middleware to use. See :doc:`/topics/http/middleware`.\n+\n+.. setting:: MIGRATION_MODULES\n+\n+``MIGRATION_MODULES``\n+---------------------\n+\n+Default: ``{}`` (Empty dictionary)\n+\n+A dictionary specifying the package where migration modules can be found on a\n+per-app basis. The default value of this setting is an empty dictionary, but\n+the default package name for migration modules is ``migrations``.\n+\n+Example::\n+\n+    {'blog': 'blog.db_migrations'}\n+\n+In this case, migrations pertaining to the ``blog`` app will be contained in\n+the ``blog.db_migrations`` package.\n+\n+If you provide the ``app_label`` argument, :djadmin:`makemigrations` will\n+automatically create the package if it doesn't already exist.\n+\n+When you supply ``None`` as a value for an app, Django will consider the app as\n+an app without migrations regardless of an existing ``migrations`` submodule.\n+This can be used, for example, in a test settings file to skip migrations while\n+testing (tables will still be created for the apps' models). If this is used in\n+your general project settings, remember to use the :option:`migrate\n+--run-syncdb` option if you want to create tables for the app.\n+\n+.. setting:: MONTH_DAY_FORMAT\n+\n+``MONTH_DAY_FORMAT``\n+--------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'F j'``\n+\n+The default formatting to use for date fields on Django admin change-list\n+pages -- and, possibly, by other parts of the system -- in cases when only the\n+month and day are displayed.\n+\n+For example, when a Django admin change-list page is being filtered by a date\n+drilldown, the header for a given day displays the day and month. Different\n+locales have different formats. For example, U.S. English would say\n+\"January 1,\" whereas Spanish might say \"1 Enero.\"\n+\n+Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the corresponding\n+locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.\n+\n+See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`. See also\n+:setting:`DATE_FORMAT`, :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`,\n+:setting:`TIME_FORMAT` and :setting:`YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT`.\n+\n+.. setting:: NUMBER_GROUPING\n+\n+``NUMBER_GROUPING``\n+-------------------\n+\n+Default: ``0``\n+\n+Number of digits grouped together on the integer part of a number.\n+\n+Common use is to display a thousand separator. If this setting is ``0``, then\n+no grouping will be applied to the number. If this setting is greater than\n+``0``, then :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` will be used as the separator between\n+those groups.\n+\n+Some locales use non-uniform digit grouping, e.g. ``10,00,00,000`` in\n+``en_IN``. For this case, you can provide a sequence with the number of digit\n+group sizes to be applied. The first number defines the size of the group\n+preceding the decimal delimiter, and each number that follows defines the size\n+of preceding groups. If the sequence is terminated with ``-1``, no further\n+grouping is performed. If the sequence terminates with a ``0``, the last group\n+size is used for the remainder of the number.\n+\n+Example tuple for ``en_IN``::\n+\n+    NUMBER_GROUPING = (3, 2, 0)\n+\n+Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the locale-dictated\n+format has higher precedence and will be applied instead.\n+\n+See also :setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR`, :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` and\n+:setting:`USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.\n+\n+.. setting:: PREPEND_WWW\n+\n+``PREPEND_WWW``\n+---------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Whether to prepend the \"www.\" subdomain to URLs that don't have it. This is only\n+used if :class:`~django.middleware.common.CommonMiddleware` is installed\n+(see :doc:`/topics/http/middleware`). See also :setting:`APPEND_SLASH`.\n+\n+.. setting:: ROOT_URLCONF\n+\n+``ROOT_URLCONF``\n+----------------\n+\n+Default: Not defined\n+\n+A string representing the full Python import path to your root URLconf, for\n+example ``\"mydjangoapps.urls\"``. Can be overridden on a per-request basis by\n+setting the attribute ``urlconf`` on the incoming ``HttpRequest``\n+object. See :ref:`how-django-processes-a-request` for details.\n+\n+.. setting:: SECRET_KEY\n+\n+``SECRET_KEY``\n+--------------\n+\n+Default: ``''`` (Empty string)\n+\n+A secret key for a particular Django installation. This is used to provide\n+:doc:`cryptographic signing </topics/signing>`, and should be set to a unique,\n+unpredictable value.\n+\n+:djadmin:`django-admin startproject <startproject>` automatically adds a\n+randomly-generated ``SECRET_KEY`` to each new project.\n+\n+Uses of the key shouldn't assume that it's text or bytes.

This controls the behavior of the request object's ``is_secure()``\n+method.\n+\n+By default, ``is_secure()`` determines if a request is secure by confirming\n+that a requested URL uses ``https://``. This method is important for Django's\n+CSRF protection, and it may be used by your own code or third-party apps.\n+\n+If your Django app is behind a proxy, though, the proxy may be \"swallowing\" the\n+fact that a request is HTTPS, using a non-HTTPS connection between the proxy\n+and Django. In this case, ``is_secure()`` would always return ``False`` -- even\n+for requests that were made via HTTPS by the end user.\n+\n+In this situation, configure your proxy to set a custom HTTP header that tells\n+Django whether the request came in via HTTPS, and set\n+``SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER`` so that Django knows what header to look for.\n+\n+Set a tuple with two elements -- the name of the header to look for and the\n+required value. For example::\n+\n+    SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER = ('HTTP_X_FORWARDED_PROTO', 'https')\n+\n+This tells Django to trust the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header that comes from our\n+proxy, and any time its value is ``'https'``, then the request is guaranteed to\n+be secure (i.e., it originally came in via HTTPS).\n+\n+You should *only* set this setting if you control your proxy or have some other\n+guarantee that it sets/strips this header appropriately.\n+\n+Note that the header needs to be in the format as used by ``request.META`` --\n+all caps and likely starting with ``HTTP_``. (Remember, Django automatically\n+adds ``'HTTP_'`` to the start of x-header names before making the header\n+available in ``request.META``.)\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    **Modifying this setting can compromise your site's security. Ensure you\n+    fully understand your setup before changing it.**\n+\n+    Make sure ALL of the following are true before setting this (assuming the\n+    values from the example above):\n+\n+    * Your Django app is behind a proxy.\n+    * Your proxy strips the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header from all incoming\n+      requests. In other words, if end users include that header in their\n+      requests, the proxy will discard it.\n+    * Your proxy sets the ``X-Forwarded-Proto`` header and sends it to Django,\n+      but only for requests that originally come in via HTTPS.\n+\n+    If any of those are not true, you should keep this setting set to ``None``\n+    and find another way of determining HTTPS, perhaps via custom middleware.\n+\n+.. setting:: SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT\n+\n+``SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT``\n+--------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+If a URL path matches a regular expression in this list, the request will not be\n+redirected to HTTPS. If :setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` is ``False``, this\n+setting has no effect.\n+\n+.. setting:: SECURE_SSL_HOST\n+\n+``SECURE_SSL_HOST``\n+-------------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+If a string (e.g. ``secure.example.com``), all SSL redirects will be directed\n+to this host rather than the originally-requested host\n+(e.g. ``www.example.com``). If :setting:`SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` is ``False``, this\n+setting has no effect.\n+\n+.. setting:: SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT\n+\n+``SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT``\n+-----------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+If ``True``, the :class:`~django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware`\n+:ref:`redirects <ssl-redirect>` all non-HTTPS requests to HTTPS (except for\n+those URLs matching a regular expression listed in\n+:setting:`SECURE_REDIRECT_EXEMPT`).\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+   If turning this to ``True`` causes infinite redirects, it probably means\n+   your site is running behind a proxy and can't tell which requests are secure\n+   and which are not. Your proxy likely sets a header to indicate secure\n+   requests; you can correct the problem by finding out what that header is and\n+   configuring the :setting:`SECURE_PROXY_SSL_HEADER` setting accordingly.\n+\n+.. setting:: SERIALIZATION_MODULES\n+\n+``SERIALIZATION_MODULES``\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Default: Not defined\n+\n+A dictionary of modules containing serializer definitions (provided as\n+strings), keyed by a string identifier for that serialization type. For\n+example, to define a YAML serializer, use::\n+\n+    SERIALIZATION_MODULES = {'yaml': 'path.to.yaml_serializer'}\n+\n+.. setting:: SERVER_EMAIL\n+\n+``SERVER_EMAIL``\n+----------------\n+\n+Default: ``'root@localhost'``\n+\n+The email address that error messages come from, such as those sent to\n+:setting:`ADMINS` and :setting:`MANAGERS`.\n+\n+.. admonition:: Why are my emails sent from a different address?\n+\n+    This address is used only for error messages. It is *not* the address that\n+    regular email messages sent with :meth:`~django.core.mail.send_mail()`\n+    come from; for that, see :setting:`DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL`.\n+\n+.. setting:: SHORT_DATE_FORMAT\n+\n+``SHORT_DATE_FORMAT``\n+---------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'m/d/Y'`` (e.g. ``12/31/2003``)\n+\n+An available formatting that can be used for displaying date fields on\n+templates. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the\n+corresponding locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.\n+See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.\n+\n+See also :setting:`DATE_FORMAT` and :setting:`SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT`.\n+\n+.. setting:: SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT\n+\n+``SHORT_DATETIME_FORMAT``\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'m/d/Y P'`` (e.g. ``12/31/2003 4 p.m.``)\n+\n+An available formatting that can be used for displaying datetime fields on\n+templates. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the\n+corresponding locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.\n+See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.\n+\n+See also :setting:`DATE_FORMAT` and :setting:`SHORT_DATE_FORMAT`.\n+\n+.. setting:: SIGNING_BACKEND\n+\n+``SIGNING_BACKEND``\n+-------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'django.core.signing.TimestampSigner'``\n+\n+The backend used for signing cookies and other data.\n+\n+See also the :doc:`/topics/signing` documentation.\n+\n+.. setting:: SILENCED_SYSTEM_CHECKS\n+\n+``SILENCED_SYSTEM_CHECKS``\n+--------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list of identifiers of messages generated by the system check framework\n+(i.e. ``[\"models.W001\"]``) that you wish to permanently acknowledge and ignore.\n+Silenced checks will not be output to the console.\n+\n+See also the :doc:`/ref/checks` documentation.\n+\n+.. setting:: TEMPLATES\n+\n+``TEMPLATES``\n+-------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+A list containing the settings for all template engines to be used with\n+Django. Each item of the list is a dictionary containing the options for an\n+individual engine.\n+\n+Here's a simple setup that tells the Django template engine to load templates\n+from the ``templates`` subdirectory inside each installed application::\n+\n+    TEMPLATES = [\n+        {\n+            'BACKEND': 'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates',\n+            'APP_DIRS': True,\n+        },\n+    ]\n+\n+The following options are available for all backends.\n+\n+.. setting:: TEMPLATES-BACKEND\n+\n+``BACKEND``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: Not defined\n+\n+The template backend to use. The built-in template backends are:\n+\n+* ``'django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates'``\n+* ``'django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2'``\n+\n+You can use a template backend that doesn't ship with Django by setting\n+``BACKEND`` to a fully-qualified path (i.e. ``'mypackage.whatever.Backend'``).\n+\n+.. setting:: TEMPLATES-NAME\n+\n+``NAME``\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: see below\n+\n+The alias for this particular template engine. It's an identifier that allows\n+selecting an engine for rendering. Aliases must be unique across all\n+configured template engines.\n+\n+It defaults to the name of the module defining the engine class, i.e. the\n+next to last piece of :setting:`BACKEND <TEMPLATES-BACKEND>`, when it isn't\n+provided. For example if the backend is ``'mypackage.whatever.Backend'`` then\n+its default name is ``'whatever'``.\n+\n+.. setting:: TEMPLATES-DIRS\n+\n+``DIRS``\n+~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+Directories where the engine should look for template source files, in search\n+order.\n+\n+.. setting:: TEMPLATES-APP_DIRS\n+\n+``APP_DIRS``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Whether the engine should look for template source files inside installed\n+applications.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The default :file:`settings.py` file created by :djadmin:`django-admin\n+    startproject <startproject>` sets ``'APP_DIRS': True``.\n+\n+.. setting:: TEMPLATES-OPTIONS\n+\n+``OPTIONS``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Default: ``{}`` (Empty dict)\n+\n+Extra parameters to pass to the template backend. Available parameters vary\n+depending on the template backend. See\n+:class:`~django.template.backends.django.DjangoTemplates` and\n+:class:`~django.template.backends.jinja2.Jinja2` for the options of the\n+built-in backends.\n+\n+.. setting:: TEST_RUNNER\n+\n+``TEST_RUNNER``\n+---------------\n+\n+Default: ``'django.test.runner.DiscoverRunner'``\n+\n+The name of the class to use for starting the test suite. See\n+:ref:`other-testing-frameworks`.\n+\n+.. setting:: TEST_NON_SERIALIZED_APPS\n+\n+``TEST_NON_SERIALIZED_APPS``\n+----------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``[]`` (Empty list)\n+\n+In order to restore the database state between tests for\n+``TransactionTestCase``\\s and database backends without transactions, Django\n+will :ref:`serialize the contents of all apps <test-case-serialized-rollback>`\n+when it starts the test run so it can then reload from that copy before running\n+tests that need it.\n+\n+This slows down the startup time of the test runner; if you have apps that\n+you know don't need this feature, you can add their full names in here (e.g.\n+``'django.contrib.contenttypes'``) to exclude them from this serialization\n+process.\n+\n+.. setting:: THOUSAND_SEPARATOR\n+\n+``THOUSAND_SEPARATOR``\n+----------------------\n+\n+Default: ``','`` (Comma)\n+\n+Default thousand separator used when formatting numbers. This setting is\n+used only when :setting:`USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` is ``True`` and\n+:setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING` is greater than ``0``.\n+\n+Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the locale-dictated\n+format has higher precedence and will be applied instead.\n+\n+See also :setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING`, :setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR` and\n+:setting:`USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.\n+\n+.. setting:: TIME_FORMAT\n+\n+``TIME_FORMAT``\n+---------------\n+\n+Default: ``'P'`` (e.g. ``4 p.m.``)\n+\n+The default formatting to use for displaying time fields in any part of the\n+system. Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the\n+locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied instead. See\n+:tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`.\n+\n+See also :setting:`DATE_FORMAT` and :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`.\n+\n+.. setting:: TIME_INPUT_FORMATS\n+\n+``TIME_INPUT_FORMATS``\n+----------------------\n+\n+Default::\n+\n+    [\n+        '%H:%M:%S',     # '14:30:59'\n+        '%H:%M:%S.%f',  # '14:30:59.000200'\n+        '%H:%M',        # '14:30'\n+    ]\n+\n+A list of formats that will be accepted when inputting data on a time field.\n+Formats will be tried in order, using the first valid one. Note that these\n+format strings use Python's :ref:`datetime module syntax\n+<strftime-strptime-behavior>`, not the format strings from the :tfilter:`date`\n+template filter.\n+\n+When :setting:`USE_L10N` is ``True``, the locale-dictated format has higher\n+precedence and will be applied instead.\n+\n+See also :setting:`DATE_INPUT_FORMATS` and :setting:`DATETIME_INPUT_FORMATS`.\n+\n+.. setting:: TIME_ZONE\n+\n+``TIME_ZONE``\n+-------------\n+\n+Default: ``'America/Chicago'``\n+\n+A string representing the time zone for this installation. See the `list of\n+time zones`_.\n+\n+.. note::\n+    Since Django was first released with the :setting:`TIME_ZONE` set to\n+    ``'America/Chicago'``, the global setting (used if nothing is defined in\n+    your project's ``settings.py``) remains ``'America/Chicago'`` for backwards\n+    compatibility. New project templates default to ``'UTC'``.\n+\n+Note that this isn't necessarily the time zone of the server. For example, one\n+server may serve multiple Django-powered sites, each with a separate time zone\n+setting.\n+\n+When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``False``, this is the time zone in which Django\n+will store all datetimes. When :setting:`USE_TZ` is ``True``, this is the\n+default time zone that Django will use to display datetimes in templates and\n+to interpret datetimes entered in forms.\n+\n+On Unix environments (where :func:`time.tzset` is implemented), Django sets the\n+``os.environ['TZ']`` variable to the time zone you specify in the\n+:setting:`TIME_ZONE` setting. Thus, all your views and models will\n+automatically operate in this time zone. However, Django won't set the ``TZ``\n+environment variable if you're using the manual configuration option as\n+described in :ref:`manually configuring settings\n+<settings-without-django-settings-module>`. If Django doesn't set the ``TZ``\n+environment variable, it's up to you to ensure your processes are running in\n+the correct environment.\n+\n+.. note::\n+    Django cannot reliably use alternate time zones in a Windows environment.\n+    If you're running Django on Windows, :setting:`TIME_ZONE` must be set to\n+    match the system time zone.\n+\n+.. _list of time zones: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones\n+\n+.. setting:: USE_I18N\n+\n+``USE_I18N``\n+------------\n+\n+Default: ``True``\n+\n+A boolean that specifies whether Django's translation system should be enabled.\n+This provides an easy way to turn it off, for performance. If this is set to\n+``False``, Django will make some optimizations so as not to load the\n+translation machinery.\n+\n+See also :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE`, :setting:`USE_L10N` and :setting:`USE_TZ`.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The default :file:`settings.py` file created by :djadmin:`django-admin\n+    startproject <startproject>` includes ``USE_I18N = True`` for convenience.\n+\n+.. setting:: USE_L10N\n+\n+``USE_L10N``\n+------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+A boolean that specifies if localized formatting of data will be enabled by\n+default or not. If this is set to ``True``, e.g. Django will display numbers and\n+dates using the format of the current locale.\n+\n+See also :setting:`LANGUAGE_CODE`, :setting:`USE_I18N` and :setting:`USE_TZ`.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The default :file:`settings.py` file created by :djadmin:`django-admin\n+    startproject <startproject>` includes ``USE_L10N = True`` for convenience.\n+\n+.. setting:: USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR\n+\n+``USE_THOUSAND_SEPARATOR``\n+--------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+A boolean that specifies whether to display numbers using a thousand separator.\n+When :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True`` and if this is also set to\n+``True``, Django will use the values of :setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR` and\n+:setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING` to format numbers unless the locale already has an\n+existing thousands separator. If there is a thousands separator in the locale\n+format, it will have higher precedence and will be applied instead.\n+\n+See also :setting:`DECIMAL_SEPARATOR`, :setting:`NUMBER_GROUPING` and\n+:setting:`THOUSAND_SEPARATOR`.\n+\n+.. setting:: USE_TZ\n+\n+``USE_TZ``\n+----------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+A boolean that specifies if datetimes will be timezone-aware by default or not.\n+If this is set to ``True``, Django will use timezone-aware datetimes internally.\n+Otherwise, Django will use naive datetimes in local time.\n+\n+See also :setting:`TIME_ZONE`, :setting:`USE_I18N` and :setting:`USE_L10N`.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The default :file:`settings.py` file created by\n+    :djadmin:`django-admin startproject <startproject>` includes\n+    ``USE_TZ = True`` for convenience.\n+\n+.. setting:: USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST\n+\n+``USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST``\n+------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+A boolean that specifies whether to use the ``X-Forwarded-Host`` header in\n+preference to the ``Host`` header. This should only be enabled if a proxy\n+which sets this header is in use.\n+\n+This setting takes priority over :setting:`USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT`. Per\n+:rfc:`7239#page-7`, the ``X-Forwarded-Host`` header can include the port\n+number, in which case you shouldn't use :setting:`USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT`.\n+\n+.. setting:: USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT\n+\n+``USE_X_FORWARDED_PORT``\n+------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+A boolean that specifies whether to use the ``X-Forwarded-Port`` header in\n+preference to the ``SERVER_PORT`` ``META`` variable. This should only be\n+enabled if a proxy which sets this header is in use.\n+\n+:setting:`USE_X_FORWARDED_HOST` takes priority over this setting.\n+\n+.. setting:: WSGI_APPLICATION\n+\n+``WSGI_APPLICATION``\n+--------------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+The full Python path of the WSGI application object that Django's built-in\n+servers (e.g. :djadmin:`runserver`) will use. The :djadmin:`django-admin\n+startproject <startproject>` management command will create a simple\n+``wsgi.py`` file with an ``application`` callable in it, and point this setting\n+to that ``application``.\n+\n+If not set, the return value of ``django.core.wsgi.get_wsgi_application()``\n+will be used. In this case, the behavior of :djadmin:`runserver` will be\n+identical to previous Django versions.\n+\n+.. setting:: YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT\n+\n+``YEAR_MONTH_FORMAT``\n+---------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'F Y'``\n+\n+The default formatting to use for date fields on Django admin change-list\n+pages -- and, possibly, by other parts of the system -- in cases when only the\n+year and month are displayed.\n+\n+For example, when a Django admin change-list page is being filtered by a date\n+drilldown, the header for a given month displays the month and the year.\n+Different locales have different formats. For example, U.S. English would say\n+\"January 2006,\" whereas another locale might say \"2006/January.\"\n+\n+Note that if :setting:`USE_L10N` is set to ``True``, then the corresponding\n+locale-dictated format has higher precedence and will be applied.\n+\n+See :tfilter:`allowed date format strings <date>`. See also\n+:setting:`DATE_FORMAT`, :setting:`DATETIME_FORMAT`, :setting:`TIME_FORMAT`\n+and :setting:`MONTH_DAY_FORMAT`.\n+\n+.. setting:: X_FRAME_OPTIONS\n+\n+``X_FRAME_OPTIONS``\n+-------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'SAMEORIGIN'``\n+\n+The default value for the X-Frame-Options header used by\n+:class:`~django.middleware.clickjacking.XFrameOptionsMiddleware`.

Set this to a string such as\n+``\"example.com\"`` for cross-domain cookies, or use ``None`` for a standard\n+domain cookie.\n+\n+Be cautious when updating this setting on a production site. If you update\n+this setting to enable cross-domain cookies on a site that previously used\n+standard domain cookies, existing user cookies will be set to the old\n+domain. This may result in them being unable to log in as long as these cookies\n+persist.\n+\n+This setting also affects cookies set by :mod:`django.contrib.messages`.\n+\n+.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY\n+\n+``SESSION_COOKIE_HTTPONLY``\n+---------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``True``\n+\n+Whether to use ``HTTPOnly`` flag on the session cookie. If this is set to\n+``True``, client-side JavaScript will not to be able to access the\n+session cookie.\n+\n+HTTPOnly_ is a flag included in a Set-Cookie HTTP response header.

This should either match the URL path of your\n+Django installation or be parent of that path.\n+\n+This is useful if you have multiple Django instances running under the same\n+hostname. They can use different cookie paths, and each instance will only see\n+its own session cookie.\n+\n+.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE\n+\n+``SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE``\n+---------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'Lax'``\n+\n+The value of the `SameSite`_ flag on the session cookie. This flag prevents the\n+cookie from being sent in cross-site requests thus preventing CSRF attacks and\n+making some methods of stealing session cookie impossible.\n+\n+Possible values for the setting are:\n+\n+* ``'Strict'``: prevents the cookie from being sent by the browser to the\n+  target site in all cross-site browsing context, even when following a regular\n+  link.\n+\n+  For example, for a GitHub-like website this would mean that if a logged-in\n+  user follows a link to a private GitHub project posted on a corporate\n+  discussion forum or email, GitHub will not receive the session cookie and the\n+  user won't be able to access the project. A bank website, however, most\n+  likely doesn't want to allow any transactional pages to be linked from\n+  external sites so the ``'Strict'`` flag would be appropriate.\n+\n+* ``'Lax'`` (default): provides a balance between security and usability for\n+  websites that want to maintain user's logged-in session after the user\n+  arrives from an external link.\n+\n+  In the GitHub scenario, the session cookie would be allowed when following a\n+  regular link from an external website and be blocked in CSRF-prone request\n+  methods (e.g. ``POST``).\n+\n+* ``None``: disables the flag.\n+\n+.. _SameSite: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/SameSite\n+\n+.. setting:: SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE\n+\n+``SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE``\n+-------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Whether to use a secure cookie for the session cookie. If this is set to\n+``True``, the cookie will be marked as \"secure,\" which means browsers may\n+ensure that the cookie is only sent under an HTTPS connection.\n+\n+Leaving this setting off isn't a good idea because an attacker could capture an\n+unencrypted session cookie with a packet sniffer and use the cookie to hijack\n+the user's session.\n+\n+.. setting:: SESSION_ENGINE\n+\n+``SESSION_ENGINE``\n+------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'django.contrib.sessions.backends.db'``\n+\n+Controls where Django stores session data.

See\n+:ref:`browser-length-vs-persistent-sessions`.\n+\n+.. setting:: SESSION_FILE_PATH\n+\n+``SESSION_FILE_PATH``\n+---------------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+If you're using file-based session storage, this sets the directory in\n+which Django will store session data. When the default value (``None``) is\n+used, Django will use the standard temporary directory for the system.\n+\n+\n+.. setting:: SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST\n+\n+``SESSION_SAVE_EVERY_REQUEST``\n+------------------------------\n+\n+Default: ``False``\n+\n+Whether to save the session data on every request. If this is ``False``\n+(default), then the session data will only be saved if it has been modified --\n+that is, if any of its dictionary values have been assigned or deleted. Empty\n+sessions won't be created, even if this setting is active.\n+\n+.. setting:: SESSION_SERIALIZER\n+\n+``SESSION_SERIALIZER``\n+----------------------\n+\n+Default: ``'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.JSONSerializer'``\n+\n+Full import path of a serializer class to use for serializing session data.\n+Included serializers are:\n+\n+* ``'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer'``\n+* ``'django.contrib.sessions.serializers.JSONSerializer'``\n+\n+See :ref:`session_serialization` for details, including a warning regarding\n+possible remote code execution when using\n+:class:`~django.contrib.sessions.serializers.PickleSerializer`.\n+\n+Sites\n+=====\n+\n+Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.sites`.\n+\n+.. setting:: SITE_ID\n+\n+``SITE_ID``\n+-----------\n+\n+Default: Not defined\n+\n+The ID, as an integer, of the current site in the ``django_site`` database\n+table. This is used so that application data can hook into specific sites\n+and a single database can manage content for multiple sites.\n+\n+\n+.. _settings-staticfiles:\n+\n+Static Files\n+============\n+\n+Settings for :mod:`django.contrib.staticfiles`.\n+\n+.. setting:: STATIC_ROOT\n+\n+``STATIC_ROOT``\n+---------------\n+\n+Default: ``None``\n+\n+The absolute path to the directory where :djadmin:`collectstatic` will collect\n+static files for deployment.\n+\n+Example: ``\"/var/www/example.com/static/\"``\n+\n+If the :doc:`staticfiles</ref/contrib/staticfiles>` contrib app is enabled\n+(as in the default project template), the :djadmin:`collectstatic` management\n+command will collect static files into this directory.

                    "msg": "### Understanding the Issue\n\nThe provided issue describes a problem where uploaded files in Django do not have consistent file permissions due to differences in temporary file handling. Specifically, files uploaded without an explicit `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting may have varying permissions because of how Python's `tempfile` module sets permissions (e.g., `0o600` on some systems). The request is to set a default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSION` of `0o644` to ensure consistency in file permissions across different environments and upload methods.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about inconsistent file permissions for uploaded files in Django. Files may have different permissions if the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is not explicitly defined. Setting the default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` will address this inconsistency.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n\n#### List of Span IDs\n- `impl:105`\n- `FileSystemStorage._save`\n- `FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode`\n\n#### Explanation of Each Code Span's Relevance\n1. **span_id: impl:105**: This code span from `django/conf/global_settings.py` includes settings related to file uploads, including `FILE_UPLOAD_TEMP_DIR` and |`FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS|. Changing `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` here would set the default permissions globally.\n2. **span_id: FileSystemStorage._save**: This code span from `django/core/files/storage.py` contains the `_save()` method of `FileSystemStorage`, where files are ultimately saved and their permissions can be set. Ensuring permissions are consistently applied here is essential.\n3. **span_id: FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode**: This code span from `django/core/files/storage.py` includes the `file_permissions_mode` method. This method returns the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting or a set value. Thus, it's directly responsible for setting the file permissions and is highly relevant to solving this issue.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. impl:105 - This code span encompasses default settings for file upload permissions in Django. Changing the default here would address the issue directly at a global level.\n2. FileSystemStorage._save - This code span represents the method responsible for saving the uploaded files and applying their permissions, making it crucial for fixing the inconsistency issue.\n3. FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode - This code span includes the method that fetches the file upload permission settings. Fixing or reviewing this area ensures that the correct permission settings are consistently applied.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Understanding the Candidate Patch\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks\n- **File 1: new file `django/conf/.backup.global_settings.py`**\n- **File 2: modified file `django/conf/global_settings.py`**\n\n#### Explanation of Each Hunk\n1. **File 1: `django/conf/.backup.global_settings.py`**\n   - A new file serving as a backup for `global_settings.py` is introduced, potentially as a backup or unnecessary generated new file. This change does not seem to be related to fixing the issue at hand directly.\n\n2. **File 2: `django/conf/global_settings.py`**\n   - The `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting is modified from `None` to `0o644`. This change directly addresses setting default global permissions for file uploads to ensure consistent permissions.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **File 1: `django/conf/.backup.global_settings.py`** - Unclear why this backup file was created; it's unrelated to fixing the stated issue.\n2. **File 2: `django/conf/global_settings.py`** - The patch correctly changes `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644`, addressing the core of the issue by ensuring consistent file permissions globally.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location for Fix\n\nThe change in `django/conf/global_settings.py` is indeed fixing the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting which is central for resolving the discussed issue. Thus, the patch is modifying the correct location.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct location `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` in `global_settings.py`, addressing the issue effectively.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking for New Issues\n\nThe patch does not introduce new issues and aligns with the given code spans, ensuring no contradictions or conflicts with existing code related to file permission settings.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues are introduced. The patch aligns well with existing logic and fixes the consistency in file permissions without contradictions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Verification of Fix\n\nThe change to default `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` resolves the inconsistency in file permissions described in the issue. This ensures temporary files get permissions of `0644` when uploaded, effectively making the patch a valid action to address the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue by setting `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644`, ensuring consistency in file upload permissions across different file handling methods.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This is necessary to control the default mode set to newly uploaded files if not specified otherwise.\n2. span_id: relevant code span ID `FileSystemStorage._save`\n- This code contains the function in the `FileSystemStorage` class, which handles the saving of the uploaded files. This is highly relevant because applying the correct file permission happens here, specifically the `os.chmod` call after the file is saved on line 283.\n3. span_id: FileSystemStorage.file_permissions_mode\n- This method or cached_property retrieves the `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` setting using `_value_or_setting` with the `file_permissions_mode` attribute. The utilization of this setting within `FileSystemStorage` helps to determine whether the file has the correct file permissions during creation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Modified Hunk: `b/django/conf/global_settings.py, lines (300-307)`\n- Original Code: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = None`\n- Modified Code: `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS = 0o644`\n- What it does: This change sets the default file permissions mode for newly uploaded files to `0o644`. This means that the user who owns the file will have read and write permissions, while all other users will have read permissions.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies `global_settings.py`, which is where the default values for Django settings are defined. Changing `FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS` to `0o644` inside this file ensures that the new default will be applied across the project unless overridden.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues by making this change. The change in the default permissions aligns with the commonly used permissions for public files, and no other parts of the code contradict the new setting specifically.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch effectively fixes the issue by setting the default permissions for file uploads to `0o644`, which addresses the problem described. It correctly modifies the global settings file. While ensuring the FILE_UPLOAD_PERMISSIONS' constant setting will prevent inconsistency in file access rights, especially that might otherwise occur by uploading with `tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile + os.rename sequence`.
