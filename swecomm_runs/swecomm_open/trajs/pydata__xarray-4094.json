When these variables are stacked and then unstacked again, it results in a `MergeError` preventing a successful roundtrip process.</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nList of span ids:\n1. DataArray.to_unstacked_dataset\n\nExplanation of each code span's relevance to the issue:\n- **DataArray.to_unstacked_dataset**: This code span contains the full implementation of the `to_unstacked_dataset` method. This is directly relevant to the issue as any fixes would need to be made in this method to handle single-dimension variables properly.\n\n<code_span_exp>The code span with ID `DataArray.to_unstacked_dataset` is a function definition directly implementing the `to_unstacked_dataset` method. Since the issue is that single-dimensional variables cause an error when using this method, examining and modifying code within this function will likely resolve the problem.</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Hunks modifying lines 1964 in `xarray/core/dataarray.py`\n\nExplanation of each modified hunk:\n- The hunk in `xarray/core/dataarray.py` modifies the line where `self.sel({variable_dim: k}).squeeze(drop=True)` is called, changing it to `self.sel({variable_dim: k}, drop=True)`. The potentially problematic `squeeze` method is removed, and the `drop=True` argument is added directly in the `sel` call.\n\n<patch_exp>The patch modifies the line that selects and extracts indexed variables from a DataArray. The change made is to call `self.sel({variable_dim: k}, drop=True)` instead of chaining `squeeze(drop=True)`. This alteration likely intends to handle single-dimensional variables correctly by dropping the dimension directly during selection.</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check Correctness of Location\nThe patch modification occurs within the correct function (`to_unstacked_dataset`) inside `xarray/core/dataarray.py` which is relevant to the issue described.\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch is modifying the correct function, `to_unstacked_dataset`, inside the `xarray.core.dataarray` module. This function is directly related to the reported issue.</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n- No immediate new issues are apparent from the changes within just the `to_unstacked_dataset` method. The code doesn't contradict any logic from the identified span itself and the drop=True argument maintains its previous roles albeit in a different method.\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch does not introduce new code discrepancies or contradict the identified span logic. It seems to be safe regarding any new issues beyond what it addresses directly.</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n- Removing the `squeeze` method and directly calling `self.sel` with the `drop=True` argument should handle selection properly even for single-dimensional data. Handling could facilitate the operational correction specified in the problem description.\n- One should independently confirm the roundtrip process behavior as part of regular tests against single-dimensional cases. Review for subtle edge conditions remains.\n \n<fix_issue_exp>The patch effectively addresses the proper indexing within the `to_unstacked_dataset` method. By removing the `squeeze` method and adding the `drop=True` parameter to `self.sel`, the change is reasonably aligned with ensuring single-dimension variables handle accurately without raising `MergeError`.</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>8</score>"
