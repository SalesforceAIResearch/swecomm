There are no evident contradictions or new issues within the identified code spans. The added check doesn't affect other parts of the constructor or the normalization and mpf value translation.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch correctly identifies the crux of the issue -- the 'L' suffix in hexadecimal strings from pickled data in Python 2 -- and addresses it by trimming this suffix before converting the string in Python 3. This type of compatibility patch is important for seamless transitions between versions, and the provided solution directly addresses the problem without introducing common pitfalls. Given no evident issues or missteps in logic, the patch should fix the described problem.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

                    "msg": "<issue_exp>\nThe issue is regarding the compatibility of pickled sympy expressions containing floats between Python 2 and Python 3. Specifically, an expression containing a float that is pickled in Python 2 and then unpickled in Python 3 results in a `ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 16: '1L'`.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nList of span ids: mpf_norm, Float._as_mpf_val, Float.__new__\n\nSpan ID `mpf_norm`:\nThis function is a low-level function responsible for normalizing `mpf` tuples. It ensures that well-formed `mpf` tuples are passed around and ultimately verifies the mantissa isn't zero for non-zero `mpf` values.\n\nSpan ID `Float._as_mpf_val`:\nThis method processes the `mpf` normalized value using the precision. It is derivative of `mpf_norm` function and directly influences how floating-point values are handled in the Sympy `Float` class.\n\nSpan ID `Float.__new__`:\nThis is the constructor for the `Float` class. It processes various types of input (`float`, `Decimal`, `tuple`, etc.) and creates the necessary `mpf` representation. It contains relevant code for handling pickled hexadecimal string representations of tuples, converting these tuples into `mpf` form using Python's `long` (in Python 2) or `int` (in Python 3) type.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nList of modified hunks:\n1. The line `num[1] = long(num[1], 16)` is replaced with `num[1] = int(num[1], 16)`.\n\nExplanation:\nThe modified hunk changes `long(num[1], 16)` to `int(num[1], 16)`. This effectively updates the compatibility of the unpickling process to support Python 3, where `int` now suffices for the functionality previously achieved by `long` in Python 2.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is in the correct location. It addresses the conversion error where `num[1]` is attempted to be converted from a hexadecimal string to an integer. This operation is highly relevant to the pickled hexadecimal form originating from Python 2 which is no longer directly compatible with Python 3 due to the removal of the `long` type.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no direct contradictions with the identified code spans. The replacement of `long` with `int` is consistent with the Python 2 to 3 change and does not introduce any known issues relevant to the functionality confined within these spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the fundamental incompatibility with the hexadecimal string conversion in Python 3 by replacing `long` with `int`, which is in line with Python 3 conventions. This change seems logically sound and aligns with common practices for transitioning between these Python versions. However, common mistakes could involve discernible subtleties regarding nuanced differences of numeric wrappers between Python versions or overlooking other implicit dependencies.\n\nOverall, I don't identify any specific omissions or errors regarding proper resolutions for the provided issue scenario.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Then each common divisor of  a  and  b\n+    divides  r, and it follows that  gcd(a, b) == gcd(b, r).\n+    The algorithm works by constructing the sequence\n+    r0, r1, r2, ..., where  r0 = a, r1 = b,  and each  rn\n+    is the remainder from the division of the two preceding\n+    elements.\n+\n+    In Python, q = a // b  and  r = a % b  are obtained by the\n+    floor division and the remainder operations, respectively.\n+    These are the most expensive arithmetic operations, especially\n+    for large  a  and  b.\n+\n+    Lehmer's algorithm is based on the observation that the quotients\n+    qn = r(n-1) // rn  are in general small integers even\n+    when  a  and  b  are very large. Hence the quotients can be\n+    usually determined from a relatively small number of most\n+    significant bits.\n+\n+    The efficiency of the algorithm is further enhanced by not\n+    computing each long remainder in Euclid's sequence. The remainders\n+    are linear combinations of  a  and  b  with integer coefficients\n+    derived from the quotients. The coefficients can be computed\n+    as far as the quotients can be determined from the chosen\n+    most significant parts of  a  and  b. Only then a new pair of\n+    consecutive remainders is computed and the algorithm starts\n+    anew with this pair.\n+\n+    References\n+    ==========\n+\n+    ..
