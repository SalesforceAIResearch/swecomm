                    "msg": "Let's break down the review process step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that when using the `@method_decorator` to decorate a method with a logger, the resulting decorator does not preserve certain attributes like `__name__`and `__module__`, causing an `AttributeError` when these attributes are subsequently accessed.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- List of span ids:\n  - `_multi_decorate`\n  - `_update_method_wrapper`\n  - `method_decorator`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `django/utils/decorators.py span_id=_multi_decorate`: This code span defines the `_multi_decorate()` function driving the addition of decorators and initial attribute preservation using `update_wrapper`. Both of these actions are central to the problem of attribute visibility and availability in the decorated method.\n   \n2. `django/utils/decorators.py span_id=_update_method_wrapper`: This code span defines the `_update_method_wrapper()` function, which tries to update the wrapper attributes based on the applied decorator. Understanding this is essential as extra assertions of attributes should not circumvent this logic.\n\n3. `django/utils/decorators.py span_id=method_decorator`: This particular span shows the mechanism for changing regular function decorators to method decorators. The problem emerges from its underlying practices inadequately retaining wrapped method attributes whereby one possible leakage resolves among these implementations ensuring attributes are highlighted, affecting curing approach divergence and recognizing meta-functional decor operability towards resolving methods accurately not fully exhibiting necessary function keys.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Modified hunk in file `django/utils/decorators.py` from line `42`\n\n<patch_exp>\n1.

                    "msg": "### Explanation\n\n#### Issue Explanation\nThe function passed to the `method_decorator` is a `partial` object, which lacks certain attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc. This leads to problems such as `AttributeError` when the decorated method tries to access these missing attributes, as demonstrated in the given logger example.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue revolves around `method_decorator` not preserving the function attributes such as `__name__`, `__module__`, and others when the decorated method is a `partial` object. This leads to an `AttributeError`, as `partial` objects do not have these attributes by default.\n</issue_exp>\n\n#### Code Span Explanation\n- **Code Span IDs**: [_multi_decorate, _update_method_wrapper, method_decorator]\n  \n- **_multi_decorate**:\n  - It\u2019s a utility function that handles applying multiple decorators to a method. This function is directly relevant to the issue since it\u2019s used internally by `method_decorator` and plays a role in whether or not `partial` objects end up with the correct attributes.\n  \n- **_update_method_wrapper**:\n  - This function ensures that any extra attributes added by decorators are copied to the function being decorated. Its relevance comes from its role in the attribute-copying mechanism of decorators, which is central to fixing the reported issue.\n\n- **method_decorator**:\n  - The function at the core of the issue, `_multi_decorate`, is called within `method_decorator` to convert a simple function decorator into a method decorator. It should be ensuring the decorated `partial` object has all necessary attributes to avoid `AttributeError`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe code spans provide a holistic view of the decorator mechanics at play:\n1. _multi_decorate: This function is significant as it decorates the method using one or more decorators. It\u2019s part of the chain where the issue lies.\n2. _update_method_wrapper: Important for copying attributes added by decorators to the function they decorate, crucial for ensuring `partial` objects receive the right attributes.\n3. method_decorator: The function transforms function decorators into method decorators. The key function in question with respect to the reported issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### Patch Explanation\n\n**Modified Hunks:**\n1. **Initial Hunk** (around line 40\u201341 in `django/utils/decorators.py`)\n   - **Before:** `bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))`\n     - Assigns a partially-applied function (bound method) to `bound_method`.\n   - **After:** \n        ```python\n        bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))\n        update_wrapper(bound_method, method)\n        ```\n     - Wraps the newly created `partial` object (`bound_method`) using `update_wrapper` to attach attributes like `__name__`, `__module__`, etc., from `method`.\n\n**Explanations:**\n1. The hunk does the necessary work to ensure that the `bound_method` (`partial` object) has the same attributes as `method` through the `update_wrapper` call. This should address the `AttributeError` raised when missing attributes on the `partial` object are accessed.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The patch modifies the code to call `update_wrapper` on the `partial` `bound_method` with `method`. This is aimed at preserving attributes such as `__name__`, `__module__`, etc., thus avoiding the `AttributeError`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n#### Checking Correct Location\n\nThe presence of `bound_method = partial(method.__get__(self, type(self)))` in `_multi_decorate` makes it clear that `partial` objects have a role in this decorator logic. Since `bound_method` is decorated after converting into a `partial` object, placing `update_wrapper(bound_method, method)` ensures setting the unnamed attributes at the right place.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. Updating `bound_method` with the attributes from `method` within `_multi_decorate` addresses the core issue directly.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### Checking for New Issues\n\nThe need for copying attributes using `update_wrapper` is logical and doesn\u2019t clash with either `_update_method_wrapper` or `method_decorator` since encapsulating a decorated method while preserving those attributes is aligned with the established API logic.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It complements the existing mechanisms (_update_method_wrapper and method_decorator) by ensuring attribute preservation on the `partial` object.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### Fix Issue\n\nUpon examining, the patch intelligently applies the `update_wrapper` to ensure the `partial` object holds the attributes, preventing `AttributeError`. This sync with common errors typically related to inadequately-patched `partial` objects, is mitigated securely by the examined patch.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems to resolve the issue effectively by preserving relevant attributes on the `partial` object, adhering to expected functional requirements, and ensuring compatibility with the current attributes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This might leave nested decorators devoid of essential attributes. The correct usage is to only update after all decorations have been applied.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n### Score\n<score>6</score>"

It is central to the issue as the partial object with missing attributes is being processed here.\n   </code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the Candidate Patch**\n   \n   List of modified hunks:\n   - Hunk modifying `_multi_decorate` in `django/utils/decorators.py`\n   - New test added in `tests/decorators/test_method_decorator.py`\n   \n   <patch_exp>\n   - The hunk in `django/utils/decorators.py` modifies the `_multi_decorate` function to properly update the bound method with an additional decorator, `@wraps(method)`. This ensures that the attributes such as `__name__` and `__module__` are copied over to `bound_method`.\n   - Adds a new test case in `tests/decorators/test_method_decorator.py` to validate that `method_decorator` preserves the wrapper assignments, including attributes like `__name__` and custom attributes such as `debug`.\n   </patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if Patch Fixes Correct Location**\n   \n   <correct_location_exp>Yes, the patch modifies `_multi_decorate` which is one of the key functions responsible for handling decorators and their method attributes. This ensures the correct attributes are preserved by adding the `@wraps(method)` decorator, solving the reported issue.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check for New Issues**\n   \n   <new_issues_exp>The patch introduces a call to `method.` inside the decorator mechanism which might not be at parity if the rest of the codebase or its performance considerations. However, it aligns with the function's design and intended resilience while correcting the oversight in transferring attributes.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if Patch Fixes the Issue**\n   \n   <fix_issue_exp>\n   - The patch does fix the issue by decorating the `bound_method` with `@wraps(method)`, thereby ensuring that the required method attributes are present and correctly transferred.\n   - The solution aligns well with common practices for decorators that involve the `wraps` from `functools` to preserve the `__module__`, `__name__`, and `__doc__` of the original function.\n   - This patch doesn't fall into common mistakes amplifying its accuracy and adjacency to the designed implementation principles mentioned in the issue description.\n   </fix_issue_exp>\n   \n7. **Score the Patch**\n\n   Based on the evaluated merits, flaws, and their mitigations:\n\n<score>9</score>"
