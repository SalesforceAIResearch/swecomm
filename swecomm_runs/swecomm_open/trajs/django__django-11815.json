The header of `django/db/migrations/writer.py` is modified to import the `Enum` class. This allows checking if a default value is an Enum instance.\n   ```diff\n   8: # SettingsReference imported for backwards compatibility in Django 2.2.\n   9: from django.conf import SettingsReference  # NOQA\n  10: from django.db import migrations\n  11: from django.db.migrations.loader import MigrationLoader\n  12: from django.db.migrations.serializer import Serializer, serializer_factory\n  13: from django.utils.inspect import get_func_args\n  14: from django.utils.module_loading import module_dir\n  15: from django.utils.timezone import now\n  16: from enum import Enum\n  17:\n   ```\n\n2. In the `MigrationWriter.serialize` method, it checks if a value is an instance of `Enum`. If it is, it serializes the name of the Enum instead of its value.\n   ```diff\n   64: if isinstance(_arg_value, Enum):\n   65:     arg_string, arg_imports = MigrationWriter.serialize(_arg_value.name)\n   66: else:\n   67:     arg_string, arg_imports = MigrationWriter.serialize(_arg_value)\n   ```\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location Check\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is applied in the method where individual argument values for migrations are serialized. This is the correct place, as it's directly responsible for rendering the default Enum values in the migration file.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### New Issues Evaluation\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modification appears to integrate well with the identified code spans and does not introduce new logical contradictions with any of them.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Patch Fix Evaluation\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the given issue by checking if a value is an Enum instance and then serializing its name instead of its value. This approach aligns perfectly with the stated problem, ensuring that migrations remain stable irrespective of translations. Importing the `enum` library in the header and applying the check inside the `serialize` method is appropriate. Further, the location and logic employed do not contradict other identified code spans.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue described is about Django migrations wrongly serializing Enum objects' values instead of their names when used as default values for CharField. When translations are applied to these enum values, the values in the migration files do not match the enum values anymore, causing errors. The expected behavior is to serialize the enum names, not the potentially translatable values, to maintain consistency across different translations.\n</issue_exp>\n\nStep 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nIDs of the code spans:\n- EnumSerializer\n- serializer_factory\n- EnumSerializer.serialize\n- IntegerChoices\n- TextChoices\n- Choices\n- CharField\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. EnumSerializer: This class is responsible for serializing Enum objects which is directly related to the issue.\n\n2. serializer_factory: This function is invoked within the EnumSerializer class to serialize values of various types including Enums.\n\n3. EnumSerializer.serialize: This method in EnumSerializer class directly handles the serialization process of Enums which is noted as problematic.\n\n4. IntegerChoices: Related to choices for Integer fields, potentially > imp          actioned by EnumSerializer for those kinds of physical choices.\n\n5. TextChoices: Related to choice for Text-type fields, it can be touched when EnumSerializer works with text-based enums.\n\n6. Choices: Used as a base class for creating different types of enumerated choices, it\u2019s relevant because EnumSerializer is supposed to handle these definitions.\n\n7. CharField: The type of model field experiencing the issue when Enum fields are used.\n</code_span_exp>\n\nStep 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Changes in EnumSerializer class\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. The original serialize function of the EnumSerializer:\n   - Retrieves the enum's class and its module.\n   - Serializes its value.\n   - Creates an import statement for the enum class.\n   - Returns serialized text including serialized value.\n\n2. Changes made:\n   - Now retrieves the name (untranslated) instead of the value of the enum.\n   - Simplifies imports only to the enum's module.\n   - Returns new serialization schema using the enum name. This ensures the generated code remains consistent regardless of eventual translations.\n</patch_exp>\n\nStep 4: Correct Function Check\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is targeting the correct function. The method `serialize` within the `EnumSerializer` class is the place where serialization of enums occurs, which is governing how enums default value and their information should be written in migration files.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\nStep 5: Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe changes simplify the value serialization to enum names, eliminating dependencies on translation values which was causing the issue. No contradictions to the identified spans are present.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\nStep 6: Fix the Issue Check\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch was correctly aimed at serializing the enum name rather than the value, addressing the fundamental problem caused by translated enum values in migration files. The details within the function change directly target required serialization fixes, avoiding common pitfalls like missectorization or lack of update on related logic.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Currently, when an Enum is used as the default value for a CharField, the generated migration file uses the translated value of the Enum object instead of its name. Since these translated values can change over time, continuing to use them could result in errors when applying older migrations. The correct behavior should be to serialize the Enum using its name rather than the translated value to ensure migrations remain stable even if translations change.\n</issue_exp>\n\n2. **Understand the identified code spans**:\n\nList of span ids:\n- EnumSerializer\n- serializer_factory\n- EnumSerializer.serialize\n- IntegerChoices\n- TextChoices\n- Choices\n- CharField\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **EnumSerializer**: This class is directly responsible for serializing Enum types into a format that can be stored in migration files. Changes to serialization will likely happen here.\n2. **serializer_factory**: This function determines which serializer to use based on the type of the input value. It needs to work with EnumSerializer to ensure correct serialization of Enums.\n3. **EnumSerializer.serialize**: This specific method in EnumSerializer handles the serializing process for Enum values and should be altered to fix our issue.\n4. **IntegerChoices**: This subclass of Enum likely represents a common usage pattern of Enums with integer values, which may inform correct behavior.\n5. **TextChoices**: Similar to IntegerChoices but probably deals with string values and defines choices via Enums for text fields.\n6. **Choices**: This represents a base Enum similar to but more general than IntegerChoices and TextChoices, potentially part of the inheritance scheme.\n7. **CharField**: Relevant because the issue involves CharFields with Enum default values, thus understanding how CharField works will inform the problem-solving strategy.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch**:\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Modification in `EnumSerializer.serialize` method.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe hunk in the `EnumSerializer.serialize` method is replacing `self.value.value` with `self.value.name` in the `serializer_factory(self.value.value).serialize()` call. By making this change, the code now serializes the Enum's name (which remains stable) rather than its value (susceptible to changes due to translation), thereby fixing the issue described.\n```python\n(v_string, v_imports = serializer_factory(self.value.name).serialize())\n```\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not**:\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function, `EnumSerializer.serialize`. This is the method responsible for serializing Enum types within Django's migration framework, and addressing the serialization logic here correctly targets the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**:\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't seem to introduce any new issues and does not contradict with other code spans. Specifically, changing the serialization from `value` to `name` simplifies the preservation of a consistent and non-translatable Enum representation, without side effects on related Enums or serialization functions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**:\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch effectively addresses the main concern of using Enum's value instead of name during serialization into migration files, which resolves the encountered translation-related error. This precise change aligns with best practices, avoids common pitfalls, and stabilizes migration files against future changes in translation.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Addition of `tests/migrations/test_serializer.py`\n\n<patch_exp>\n**Hunk 1: Changes in `django/db/migrations/serializer.py`**\n- Modified `EnumSerializer.serialize`:\n  Before patch: It serialized Enum values using their `value`.\n  After patch: It serializes Enum values using their `name`.\n- Removed unused variable `v_string, v_imports`.\n\nThis hunk changes the serialization logic to correctly use the Enum name instead of value which aligns with the issue fix itself.\n\n**Hunk 2: Addition of `tests/migrations/test_serializer.py`**\n- Created a new test file to validate Enum serialization:\n  It checks if a CharField with Enum default values is serialized to use the Enum's name, ensuring the patch correctly resolves the issue without introducing any regressions.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check Correct Function\nEnsuring the patch addresses the correct location or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function: `EnumSerializer.serialize`. This method is directly involved in serializing Enum values in migrations, which is the core of the described issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check New Issues\nEnsuring the patch does not introduce further contradictions.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce new issues. It directly modifies the serialization logic for Enum values to use their `name`, and accompanying tests validate the correct functionality.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Fixes the Issue\nComparing the generated patch against known common mistakes by LLMs.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to correctly fix the issue. It makes the necessary changes in the `EnumSerializer.serialize` method to ensure that Enum names are used instead of values. Additionally, it includes robust tests to ensure the changes work as expected. Thus, the patch does not fall into common mistakes made by LLMs, such as misunderstanding Enum serialize logic or failing to address affected tests.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score\n<score>9</score>"

This avoids problems related to translation, where the value of the Enum member might get translated, leading to a `ValueError` when applying migrations.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nSpan IDs: \nEnumSerializer,\nserializer_factory,\nEnumSerializer.serialize,\nIntegerChoices,\nTextChoices,\nChoices,\nCharField\n\n- EnumSerializer: This class is responsible for serializing Enum objects, directly related to the faulty serialization using the value instead of the name.\n- serializer_factory: This function is responsible for returning the correct serializer based on the type of the value, which includes Enum types.\n- EnumSerializer.serialize: The serialization function within the EnumSerializer class, which currently uses the value of the Enum member, needing modification to use the name instead.\n- IntegerChoices: Provides context on how to create enumerated integer choices, can be considered relevant for understanding Enum customizations.\n- TextChoices: Similar to IntegerChoices but for text choices, shows ways to create Enum types for textual representations.\n- Choices: Base class for creating enumerated choices, applies generically to all types of Enums used in Django models.\n- CharField: The field type of interest here, where Enum objects are used as default values influencing migration generation.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\nModified Hunks:\n1. serializer.py (b/django/db/migrations/serializer.py): This is removing the direct serialization of the value (`self.value.value`) and changing it to serialize the name (`self.value.name`) instead within EnumSerializer.\n   - The patch removes the line `v_string, v_imports = serializer_factory(self.value.value).serialize(); imports = {'import %s' % module, *v_imports}` and replaces it with `imports = {'import %s' % module}; return \"%s.%s.%s\" % (module, enum_class.__name__, self.value.name), imports`.\n\n2. test_serializer.py (b/tests/migrations/test_serializer.py): This introduces a new test to confirm the behavior of the EnumSerializer.\n   - It adds a new test within the newly created `TestEnumSerializer` class using Django's testing framework to check that serialization returns the Enum name and appropriate imports are included.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function, `EnumSerializer.serialize`, which is responsible for the incorrect usage of the Enum value in migrations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. It modifies only the specific part needing the change, and existing functionality outside Enum serialization should remain unaffected. In fact, it simplifies the imports management, minimizing potential dependency issues.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch fixes the issue described. The candidate patch replaces the usage of `self.value.value` with `self.value.name`, ensuring that migrations now reference the Enum name consistently. This change directly addresses the translation issue as Enum names are not subject to translation, solving the ValueError problem mentioned in the issue description.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
