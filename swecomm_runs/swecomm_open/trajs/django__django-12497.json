Thus, the patch significantly fixes the issue and doesn't fall into common mistakes posed by language models, such as introducing inconsistent or syntactically incorrect code.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

Additionally, it includes the parameter `symmetrical=False`, which is outdated and not required since Django 3.0 for intermediary models to self.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe error message given by Django when dealing with a Many-to-Many field with more than two ForeignKeys should refer to using ManyToManyField instead of ForeignKey.

The issue directly involves the `ManyToManyField`, as it currently incorrectly suggests using `ForeignKey` in its error hint.\n\n2. **Span ID: ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model**\n   - **Relevance**: This function contains the logic that raises the error with the incorrect hint. Fixing this hint will ensure that the error message is correct when it raises relevant errors related to `ManyToManyField`.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **ManyToManyField**: Defines the ManyToManyField class, which is incorrectly referenced in the error message.\n- **ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model**: This function contains the code that raises the error message in question, making it directly relevant to the issue described.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n## Step 3: Understanding the Candidate Patch\n### Modified Hunks\n- **Original Code**:\n```\nhint=(\n   'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n   'use ForeignKey(\"%s\", symmetrical=False, through=\"%s\").'\n) % (\n    RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,\n    relationship_model_name,\n)\n```\n* **Patched Code**:\n```\nhint=(\n   'If you want to create a recursive relationship, '\n   'use ManyToManyField(\"%s\", through=\"%s\").'\n) % (\n    RECURSIVE_RELATIONSHIP_CONSTANT,\n    relationship_model_name,\n)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Modified Hunks\n- The modified hunk changes the error hint from suggesting the use of `ForeignKey` to `ManyToManyField` and also removes the outdated and unnecessary parameter `symmetrical=False`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk**:\n   - **Original Hint**: The hint incorrectly suggests using `ForeignKey` with `symmetrical=False`.\n   - **Patched Hint**: Corrects this to `ManyToManyField` and removes the outdated and unnecessary `symmetrical=False` parameter.\n</patch_exp>\n\n## Step 4: Correct Location Check\n- **Verify**: The patch is applied in the function `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model`, which is the correct location as per the provided identified code spans and issue summary.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct functionality within the `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model` method where the error hint is generated.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n## Step 5: New Issues Check\n- There don\u2019t seem to be any new issues introduced by this patch; it replaces the incorrect hint text with the correct class reference and removes deprecated parameters.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch doesn't introduce any new issues. It simply corrects the hint to refer to ManyToManyField and removes the unused and outdated `symmetrical=False`.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n## Step 6: Fix Issue Verification\n- **Evaluation**: The patch correctly identifies and fixes the usage of `ForeignKey` in the hint as per the described issue. The removal of `symmetrical=False` is also correct and aligns with Django\u2019s current requirements.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue correctly by updating the hint to use ManyToManyField and removing the outdated `symmetrical` parameter.

Understanding the Candidate Patch:\nModified Hunks:\n- Hunk 1 (lines 1303-1321 in the patched `related.py` file)\n- Hunk 2 (lines 1318-1333 in the patched `related.py` file)\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1: Updates the first error message where the hint is revised to simply advise the usage of 'through_fields' without misleading references to 'ForeignKey' or the deprecated 'symmetrical' attribute for recursive relationships.\n- Hunk 2: Identically updates the second error message with similar corrections, focusing on the `through_fields` instruction without confusing many-to-many-specific terminology.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Checking Patch Location:\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is modifying the correct locations (`lines 1303-1321` and `lines 1318-1333` in the `ManyToManyField._check_relationship_model` method) where the flawed hints were originally defined. These corrections directly address the error messages related to intermediary models in many-to-many relationships.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Evaluating New Issues:\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans. The changes correct the hints in existing error messages accurately without impacting other logic or creating new inconsistencies.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Verify If the Patch Fixes the Issue:\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch replaces the incorrect hints with more appropriate guidance without including 'ForeignKey' or the outdated 'symmetrical' parameter, aligning well with the issue description. Common mistakes by LLMs, such as misunderstanding context or syntax errors, are avoided in this case. Hence, the patch appears to appropriately resolve the misstated hints.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The erroneous hint appears within the checks.Error occurrence relevant for validating many-to-many intermediary models. Changing hints here is appropriate and would solve the described issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe proposed patch does not introduce any new issues. It correctly updates `ForeignKey` references to `ManyToManyField` within the hints of `checks.Error` messages, maintaining the string formatting and necessary contextual information.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch correctly addresses the issue by amending inaccurate error hints tied to `ForeignKey` and replacing them with contextually accurate reference to `ManyToManyField`. The changes appropriately align with the actual requirement of many-to-many intermediary models concerning `through` relationships, eliminating outdated constraints like `symmetrical=False`.\n \nHowever, LLMs commonly make errors such as syntactically incorrect formatting and logical contradictions, but this patch does not exhibit such mistakes and correctly alters pertinent parts of the codebase.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
