Understand the issue\n<issue_exp>\nThe user is receiving a UserWarning from the `constrained_layout` engine even when `constrained_layout` is set to `False`.

Understand the identified code spans\nSpan ids: `FigureBase.subplots_adjust`, `ConstrainedLayoutEngine`\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `FigureBase.subplots_adjust`: The code span shows the relevant parameters and part of the logic that updates subplot layout parameters within the `subplots_adjust` method. The warning that is issued when the layout engine is incompatible with `subplots_adjust` is of particular importance here.\n2. `ConstrainedLayoutEngine`: This code span contains the definition of the `ConstrainedLayoutEngine`, including its attributes like `_adjust_compatible` and possibly `_colorbar_gridspec`, which relate to layout compatibility and could be involved in triggering the warning.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n#### 3. Understand the candidate patch\nModified hunks list: \n1. Hunk modifying `(self.get_layout_engine() is not None and not self.get_layout_engine().adjust_compatible)`.\n   \n<patch_exp>\n1.

Check if the patch is fixing the correct function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct function `subplots_adjust` as this is the location where the compatibility of the layout engine is being checked under different conditions, and the warning is being issued.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n#### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces a conditional check involving `PlaceHolderLayoutEngine`, but it does not seem to define or import what `PlaceHolderLayoutEngine` is. If `PlaceHolderLayoutEngine` is not defined anywhere in the code, this would result in a `NameError`, causing a potential run-time crash.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n#### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe intended fix seems plausible but has flaws. Since it offers another guard rail by not raising warnings for `PlaceHolderLayoutEngine`, it might sometimes bypass the checks and alleviate the warnings. However, if `PlaceHolderLayoutEngine` is not defined, this solution is futile due to a `NameError`. Additionally, if `PlaceHolderLayoutEngine` is not the only exception case, it won't robustly address the core problem.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>5</score>"

This warning is due to the incompatibility between these layout settings and the layout engine, as per the current configurations in the codebase.\n\n**Output:**\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is that a UserWarning is generated when using `plt.subplots_adjust` or `bbox_inches='tight'`, even if `constrained_layout=False`. The warning indicates an incompatibility with constrained layout, but this warning should ideally not appear when `constrained_layout` is set to False.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\nLet\u2019s first list the span IDs and then analyze their relevancy to the issue.\n\n**List of Span IDs:**\n- FigureBase.subplots_adjust\n- ConstrainedLayoutEngine\n\n#### Analyzing Relevancy:\n1. **FigureBase.subplots_adjust**: \n   This code contains the method `subplots_adjust` which adjusts subplot layout parameters. The UserWarning related to the layout engine's compatibility with `subplots_adjust` and/or `tight_layout` is generated here. This is directly relevant because it\u2019s where the warning is being triggered.\n\n2. **ConstrainedLayoutEngine**:\n   This represents the engine for `constrained_layout` and includes a class that handles constraints for layout adjustments. It is relevant as any changes or checks for `constrained_layout` processing would involve classes and attributes defined here.\n\n**Output:**\n<code_span_exp>\n- FigureBase.subplots_adjust: This code pertains to the `subplots_adjust` method, responsible for adjusting subplot layout parameters where the UserWarning in the issue is generated.\n- ConstrainedLayoutEngine: This class implementation relates to the `constrained_layout` system. It defines whether adjustment functions for layouts are suitable with constrained layouts.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nPatch Analysis:\n\n#### List of Modified Hunks:\n1. Changes in file `lib/matplotlib/figure.py` around lines 2555\n\n**Patch Explanation:**\n1. **Original Code:**\n   ```python\n            elif mpl.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use']:\n                layout = 'constrained'\n   ```\n\n2. **Patched Code:**\n   ```python\n            elif mpl.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use'] and layout != 'none':\n                layout = 'constrained'\n   ```\n\nThe change introduces an additional condition to ensure that `layout` is not set to 'none' even if `mpl.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use']` is true. \n\n**Output:**\n<patch_exp>\n1. The modified code changes the conditional check to only set `layout` to 'constrained' if `mpl.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use']` is true and `layout` is not 'none'. This additional condition helps in avoiding the improper setting which could lead to incorrect warning issuances.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check Location Correctness\n\n**Patched Location Analysis:**\nWe are modifying the initial setup of the layout engine in `lib/matplotlib/figure.py`. Since this handles the initial determination of layout, it seems appropriate to place the fix here to encompass checking for `constrained_layout=False` correctly.\n\n**Output:**\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch is applied to the correct location within the layout setting logic of Matplotlib's figure handling.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Introduction of New Issues\n\n**Contradictions Identification:**\nThere are no direct contradictions to the provided code spans since:\n- The logic avoids setting layout to constrained improperly, aligning well with `subplots_adjust` semantics.\n- `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` remains unaffected as the established attribute `_adjust_compatible` static assignment standards haven't been altered.\n\n**Output:**\n<new_issues_exp>\nNo new issues seem to be introduced by this patch. It aligns well with the existing logic without introducing contradictions.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Issue Fix Effectiveness\n\n**Effectiveness Analysis:**\nThe added conditional shift ensures that warning won\u2019t trigger improperly due to misunderstanding between auto-setup and provided `layout='none'` resulting inadequate warning ovcer behavior thus making better check.\n\nFurthermore, this logic modification doesn't cause contradictions attributable usual LLM-led errors like misplacing operational logic can't be observed.\n\n**Output:**\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch appears to fix the issue by ensuring that the warning is not improperly generated when `constrained_layout=False`. Adding the condition to check for `layout != 'none'` logically prevents the warning mentioned in the issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score\n\nConsidering the logical tenor improves approach Minimized no contradictions further remained standing layout consistency guiding ensuring prospective encounter awaits errors managed synergizing fault tolerance elimination  \n  \n<score>9</score>"

This method contains logic to warn the user when a specific layout engine, such as constrained layout, is used.\n\nThe code span `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` contains the `ConstrainedLayoutEngine` class definition. This span is pertinent because its `_adjust_compatible` attribute is used within the `subplots_adjust` method to decide if adjustments are compatible, thus affecting the warning message.</code_span_exp>\n\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:** \n\n- List of modified hunks:\n  - Hunk 1: Modifies condition on layout parameter's None check.\n\n<patch_exp>Hunk 1 modifies the condition that checks whether `mpl.rcParams['figure.constrained_layout.use']` is True. It adds an additional check to ensure that the `layout` parameter is not set to 'none'. This change aims to avoid using 'constrained' as `layout` value when explicitly not wanted.</patch_exp>\n\n4. **Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>The patch correctly targets the function responsible for setting the layout engine based on the conditions evaluated. The modified portion is within the figure's layout engine setting logic, which directly influences the constrained layout functionality.</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues, especially if it contradicts with any of the identified code spans:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>The patch introduces an additional logical condition to filter out cases where `layout` is set to 'none'. This only refines the decision logic for setting layout values and does not contradict other identified spans or introduce new issues within the evaluated contexts.</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>With an explicit check to confirm that \u2018layout\u2019 is not set to 'none,' this patch avoids falsely assigning the 'constrained' value in unintended scenarios. Thus, it would correctly prevent the unnecessary UserWarning linked with incompatible layout constraints. Potential mistakes like failing to compare properly or logic placement missteps aren\u2019t seen in this case version.
