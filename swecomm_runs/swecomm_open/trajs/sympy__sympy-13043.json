This unordered nature causes inconsistencies and test failures due to some changes in the core code. The expected behavior is to have the function return the values in a consistent, sorted order for reproducibility and consistency in the results.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>[decompose]</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe identified code span with span_id `decompose` represents the `decompose` function in the `integrals/intpoly.py` file. This function is responsible for decomposing an input polynomial into homogeneous ones of smaller or equal degree and returns these as a dictionary. When `separate=True`, it converts this dictionary into a list of values which are, by default, returned in an arbitrary order. This affects the consistency and order of results, causing potential test failures referenced in the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified Hunk in `sympy/polys/polytools.py`:**\n   - **Before:** The `decompose` function had a single argument `f`.\n   - **After:** The `decompose` function signature is expanded to accept an additional optional parameter `separate`, defaulting to False.\n   - **Explanation:** This seeks to address the issue by enabling a more flexible management of function outputs. The injected `if separate` condition sorts the decomposed function output values based on their string representation before returning them as a list, ensuring predictable and consistent output order.\n\n2. **Added lines in `decompose` Function Implementation:**\n   - **Before:** Directly returned `list(map(f.per, result))`.\n   - **After:** Introduced:\n     ```python\n     if separate:\n         return sorted(list(f.rep.decompose().values()), key=lambda x: str(x.as_expr()))\n     ```\n   - **Explanation:** This modification ensures that when `separate` is set to True, the values are sorted deterministically based on their string representation. If `separate` is False, the original map behavior is maintained.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch correctly modifies the `decompose` function, located in the appropriate module and responsible for the decomposition logic that was referenced in the issue. The `separate` parameter was precisely where the issue stated the inconsistent order occurs.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe changes introduced do not contradict the identified code spans directly. However, introducing new logic to handle the sorting and modifying the function signature might misalign with other parts of the code relying on the original function definition without clear documentation and test cases. The patch could potentially introduce bugs if other calls to `decompose()` expect only one parameter.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the core of the issue - disorder in the list returned by `decompose()` with `separate=True`. Yet, it doesn't comprehensively handle edge cases or ensure existing functionalities without proper documentation and test cases confirm non-interference. New logic introduces unknowns that should have wider context consideration (e.g., impact assessment where function is used across code base).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>6</score>"

Changes to docstring explaining `decompose`.\n2. Modification of the existing logic for `decompose`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk 1: Changes to docstring explaining `decompose`**\n   This change updates the docstring to specify that if `separate=True`, a sorted list of the constituent monomials is returned.\n\n2. **Hunk 2: Modification of the logic for `decompose`**\n   - The call to `S(expr)` is replaced by `sympify(expr)`.\n   - Re-arranged condition order so that symbols are initialized first.\n   - Added a custom sorting algorithm using specific key comparators for handling numbers and polynomial total degrees.\n   - The return statement has been modified to use this sort order to always ensure a predictable and consistent sort behavior.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check if the Patch is Fixing the Correct Function\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct function `decompose` within the correct file (`sympy/integrals/intpoly.py`). The changes directly address the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe revised patch does not introduce any new issues that contradict the other code identified in code spans and the overall logic of the program. It enhances the existing behavior by ensuring consistent sorting which aligns with the requirement.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch can fix the issue. Previously, the output list from `decompose()` when `separate=True` was arbitrarily ordered, which led to inconsistent test results. By introducing explicit sorting using both the term string and polynomial degree, the new patch ensures a consistent and ordered list of polynomials returned when `separate=True`. Two common LLM pitfalls\u2014failed cursory fixes and inappropriate location patches\u2014do not apply to this change, indicating its effectiveness.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
