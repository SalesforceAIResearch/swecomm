Currently, two `ValidationError` instances with identical messages are not considered equal, which can complicate testing. To fix this, an `__eq__` method needs to be added to allow `ValidationErrors` to be compared. This comparison should consider not only the messages but also normalize the error collections to be independent of the order of errors.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understanding the Identified Code Spans\n**List of span IDs:** \n1. ValidationError\n2. ValidationError.messages\n3. ValidationError.__init__\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. `ValidationError`: This is the class for the custom error. Adding an `__eq__` method would be relevant to this class.\n2. `ValidationError.messages`: This property returns the messages of the validation errors. Adjusting comparison involves using these messages.\n3. `ValidationError.__init__`: This is the initializer for the `ValidationError` class. It sets up the error messages, and understanding its structure helps in comparing instances correctly.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understanding the Candidate Patch\n**List of Modified hunks:**\n1. Modification in `messages` property\n2. Addition of `__eq__` method\n3. Addition of `_normalize_error_dict` method\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified `messages` property lines 155-156:**\n   Changes from returning a plain list of messages to returning a set wrapped in a list. This ensures uniqueness and unordered nature of the items.\n\n2. **Addition of `__eq__` method lines 166-173:**\n   Adds a method to compare two `ValidationError` instances. It checks if both are instances of `ValidationError`, have a `error_dict`, and then normalize and compare those dictionaries. Or if both have `error_list`, their normalized messages are compared.\n\n3. **Addition of `_normalize_error_dict` method: lines 175-179:**\n   This helper method processes the error dictionary to ensure all textual representations of errors are sorted, providing a normalized form that is easier to compare for equality.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Check\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the `ValidationError` class by adding an `__eq__` method and modifying the `messages` property. Additionally, a helper method `_normalize_error_dict` is added for internal use in the comparison.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce any new issues. The inclusion of the `__eq__` and `_normalize_error_dict` methods and the modification to the `messages` property support the intended functionality without contradicting any existing spans. However, it should be made sure that calling list(set(...)) still behaves as expected and doesn't mutate critical elements accidentally.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue well by:\n1. Ensuring unique, unordered messages through the modification of the `messages` property.\n2. Introducing an `__eq__` method to compare `ValidationError` instances using `_normalize_error_dict` to ensure equivalence without regard to order.\n\nA confirmation test should be made to ensure these implementations work as expected (e.g., ensuring message only differs in order are still considered equal).\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>\n"

Understand the identified code spans:\n\nList of span IDs:\n- ValidationError\n- ValidationError.messages\n- ValidationError.__init__\n\nExplanation of how each code span is relevant to the issue:\n\n1. `ValidationError`: \n   The entire `ValidationError` class. The modification needs to occur here because this class defines the structure and behavior of validation errors in Django.\n\n2. `ValidationError.messages`: \n   The `messages` property provides a flat list of all messages in the `ValidationError`. Understanding this span helps us appreciate how error messages are structured within an instance.\n\n3. `ValidationError.__init__`: \n   The constructor method of `ValidationError`. It initializes instances with various forms of input data (e.g., a string, list, or dictionary of error messages). This understanding is crucial to gauge how errors are stored within an instance. It also potentially influences the equality operation itself.\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1.

Adds two static methods `_compare_error_dict` and `_compare_error_list` to help with deeply nested comparisons:\n   - `_compare_error_dict` checks if two dictionaries have identical keys and compares their values using `_compare_error_list`.\n   - `_compare_error_list` compares lists of errors irrespective of their order.\n\n<patch_exp>\nThe patch includes modifications to `django.core.exceptions.ValidationError` to incorporate functionality that allows checking for equality between instances:\n1. It implements `__eq__` method for instance-level comparison.\n2. It introduces `_compare_error_dict`, which compares the keys and values of two error dictionaries.\n3. It introduces `_compare_error_list`, which compares lists of errors accountingly irrespective of their order.\nThis holistic approach ensures that validation errors can be compared accurately, adhering to the requirements identified in the issue.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### 4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not:\nThe patch correctly adds the `__eq__` method within the `ValidationError` class, which is the precise location where this feature needs to be implemented.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is fixing the correct function. The `__eq__` method was correctly added to the `ValidationError` class.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### 5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:\nWe need to determine if the added methods cause any contradictions or new issues with the existing class structure, particularly examined spans. The introduced methods do not break any encapsulation or modify the internal data beyond comparison purposes. They do not contradict the established behaviors seen in identified code spans.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new issues. The methods introduced are consistent with the current design and do not contradict any existing spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### 6. Check if the patch can fix the issue:\nAnalysis indicates several potential common pitfalls:\n1. Property or namespace overlap.\n2. Logic errors in the equality conditions.\n\nNo common languages model mistakes such as unbound identifier issues or missed references are detected. The patch thoroughly ensures two `ValidationError` instances can be evaluated accurately considering order-independent conditions on dictionary and list structures.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue correctly by enabling order-independent comparison of `ValidationError` instances and maintaining class integrity. The logic is appropriately scoped and integrates well without side effects or masking hacks common in large language model outputs.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

The `__eq__` method was added to the `ValidationError` class. This method first checks if the `other` instance is of type `ValidationError`. If neither instance has an `error_dict`, it uses `_compare_error_dict` static method to compare their dictionaries. Similarly, for instances with `error_list`, it uses `_compare_error_list`. If neither structure is present, it compares `message`, `code`, and `params` attributes directly. Two static methods `_compare_error_dict` and `_compare_error_list` have been introduced.

It makes use of additional helper functions `_compare_error_dict` and `_compare_error_list` to handle deeper structures within `ValidationError`. Importantly, it includes comparisons that are order-independent, as was requested in the issue. \n\nHere are potential factors to consider:\n- The `ValidationError` diff previously was only indirectly managed through its constructs in `__init__`, which indicated coding leniency on input shapes whether dict, list, or string. Comparing with permutations for deeper nested dictionaries or lists via internal comparers unintentionally might clutter statistical representation cost.\n   \nOverall, the patch does not have any significant apparent flaws.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

The __eq__ method logically belongs to the ValidationError class since it needs to compare instances of ValidationError.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch introduces condition handling for kind of ValidationErrors (with error_dict or error_list) completely separate from each other but may not thoroughly address nested or mixed cases (`error_dict` and a common list errors `error_list`). It appears coherent with existing `__init__` structure without introducing contradictions. \n\nHowever, it would be good to have additional safeguards or more comprehensive comparison logic to handle edge cases more robustly specifically sorting such directive arrays could differ on nested ValidationErrors.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue by introducing a comprehensive __eq__ method that compares ValidationError objects in an order-independent manner, which should logically resolve the problem outlined. However, it could still suffer from complexities around mixed cases where encompasses multiple nested errors ideally require more intricate testing in complex possible validationError compositions. Nonetheless, it squarely targets the resolution needed per described structure presumed guidance align the primary issue.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n7. **Final score**\n\n<score>8</score>"

This method allows validation for equality of `ValidationError` instances based on their `error_dict`, `error_list`, or `message`.\n    - A `__ne__` method is also added to handle inequality.\n    - Changes to the `__hash__` method to ensure that objects of this class remain hashable and unique based on their content.\n\n2. New test cases in tests/validation_error_tests/test_validation_error_equality.py:\n    - These test cases check the equality and inequality of `ValidationError` instances in various scenarios: single messages, lists of messages, dictionary of messages, the presence of `code` and `params`, as well as mixing types where simple messages are compared with error lists.\n</modified_hunks>\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is modifying the correct location. The modifications are made to the `ValidationError` class within the `django/core/exceptions.py` file, which is precisely where this new functionality is needed. Additionally, new tests are added to verify the changes made.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any evident new issues. It ensures that different types of `ValidationError` comparison are addressed through extensive test cases for potential equality and inequality checks. The modifications fit well within the class without breaking existing properties and methods.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nYes, the patch seems to address the issue comprehensively. Here\u2019s why:\n   1. The `__eq__` method compares `ValidationError` instances based on their internal data structures (`error_dict`, `error_list`, `message`, `code`, and `params`).\n   2. The use of sorting within the list comparisons ensures that the order of errors in the list does not affect the equality check\u2014a key aspect stated in the issue requirements.\n   3. The newly added tests appear to cover various edge cases effectively, ensuring the equality and inequality behavior works as intended.\n\nThe potential issues patches like these might commonly encounter include:\n   - *Inconsistency in comparison due to missing attributes*: This is handled with the guarded checks against `hasattr`.\n   - *Hash collision*: Safeguards against this with updated `__hash__`.\n\nTherefore, the patch appears robust against potential LLM common mistakes.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"
