The location of the `_check_default_pk` method implies its relevance.\n3. **Model._check_default_pk**: This is the actual function where the warning models.W042 is generated, marking it as extremely relevant to the issue.\n4. **AutoFieldMixin**: Represents a mixin for auto-incrementing fields, potentially linked to the nature of primary keys.\n5. **Options.setup_pk**: A function used in setting up the primary key field for a model, contributing to how primary keys are handled.\n6. **Options._prepare**: This function promotes the primary key from a parent model if no primary key is explicitly set, relevant for understanding inheritance behaviors that cause the warning.\n7. **Options**: Defines a class providing metadata options for Django models, governing behavior and attributes related to model fields and primary keys.\n8. **Options._get_default_pk_class**: This retrieves the default primary key class, used for generating a default auto-incrementing primary key if not overridden by app-level config settings.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified hunk in _check_default_pk function in django/db/models/base.py:**\n   - **Original Code (before patch):**\n     ```\n     @classmethod\n     def _check_default_pk(cls):\n         if (\n             cls._meta.pk.auto_created and\n             ...\n             not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden\n         ):\n         ...\n     ```\n   - **Patched Code (after patch):**\n     ```\n     @classmethod\n     def _check_default_pk(cls):\n         if (\n             cls._meta.pk.auto_created and\n             not settings.is_overridden('DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD') and\n             not cls._meta.app_config._is_default_auto_field_overridden and\n             not any(hasattr(base, '_meta') and base._meta.pk for base in cls.__bases__)\n         ):\n         ...\n     ```\n \n   Explanation:\n   The patch adds an additional condition (`not any(hasattr(base, '_meta') and base._meta.pk for base in cls.__bases__)`) which checks that none of the base classes have a defined primary key. This ensures the warning is not raised if an inherited parent class already defines a primary key.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `_check_default_pk` function, which is the function where the models.W042 warning is generated. So, it is addressing the correct location within the codebase.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere are no new issues introduced by the patch. The logic in the patch adds a check for inherited primary keys that match the purpose outlined in the identified code spans and the issue requirements. It does not contradict any of the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch can fix the issue. It addresses the specific requirement described in the issue by ensuring that auto-created primary keys are avoided when a base class already defines a primary key, thus eliminating the false positive warnings related to the W042 check. The patch adds a necessary check that improves the inherited model's handling, which aligns with the described problem and provided example class (such as 'Entity' -> 'User').\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>10</score>"

Specifically, for inherited models, changes might be needed in the logic handling how primary keys from base and derived classes interact, which are likely in the Meta options or model checks code spans. Therefore, this patch changes a global default setting but may not fix the root cause of warnings for models inheriting primary keys defined in their ancestors.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. **Check if the patch is introducing any new issues:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modification itself does not introduce new issues but it\u2019s essential to verify that this change won't affect other parts of the codebase that rely on the current `DEFAULT_AUTO_FIELD` setting being `AutoField`. Changing to `BigAutoField` can cause unintended migrations or SQL schema changes, necessitating compatibility and regression testing.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch only sets the global default primary key type to `BigAutoField`, which follows the hint in the warning, but it likely doesn't influence the derivation of primary keys in inherited models where keys are expected to be retained from the base model without override. The issue seems deeper, likely around interpreting or overriding model meta options (`cls._check_default_pk`, etc.). If the inheritance hierarchy is correct and well-implemented, this change might not fully address the systemic cause but may suppress warnings as a side effect because fewer models will hit the auto key assignment logic.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n\n<score>2</score>"

It changes the default to `BigAutoField` but doesn't apply customized logic to check if inherited properties should avoid default settings.\n\nSome common mistakes:\n- The fix is too broad and changes all auto fields, rather than isolating pre-defined primary keys in models.\n- It does not interact with elicited models or ancestors specified to cater to pre-configured primary keys from ancestral models.\n- Does not modify specific model behaviors or authenticate other overriding realms for the settings.\n  \nIt suggests somewhat a silencing of the warning without acknowledging legitimate inherited custom primary keys.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Step 7: Score\n\nFollowing Ivmar's principles and based on the deducted points:\n\n1.

The second hunk explicitly adds a BigAutoField as the 'id' field of `AbstractUser`, asserting a non-auto-created primary key in this model.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Checking the Correct Location ###\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe locations targeted in the patch are good. Changing the global setting and explicitly defining fields in the AbstractUser class is aligned towards addressing the reported issue. These are appropriate spots since the warnings suggest fixing models' behalf to use 'BigAutoField.'\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Checking New Issues Introduced ###\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues based on the identified spans. The defaults have been updated, and explicit primary keys have been added only deemed where necessary considering W042 warning analytics above mentions for models.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Checking Patch Against Common LLM Mistakes ###\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nIt effectively addresses the present issue by making default changes and explicitly adding the primary key much as what caused W042 warnings about auto-created primary keys.\nHowever:\n1. This change of fields will not reflect completely required inherited Fields from primary parents unless and patches all highlighted models above directly achieve broader summarization. seeing W042 persists under Abstract overlapping inducement learner.\nPulled-off variables binding entries that simplistic semantics considers mutualized padding:\n```E.g. Issues individually further configurations post app models corrections emerged under (0013 check_all_models model label chances subclasses not..
