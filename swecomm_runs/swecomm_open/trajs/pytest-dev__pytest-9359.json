It intelligently removes only lines starting with the \"@\" symbol, which generally denote decorators; it does not affect other parts of the explanation. There is no contradiction with the identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch reasonably addresses the problem described in the issue by removing decorator lines from the explanation string. It doesn't fall into common mistakes like incomplete filtering because it specifically looks for lines starting with \"@\" within the explanation string. However, it does rely on the assumption that decorator lines will always start with ' @ ', which generally holds but should be verified. Nevertheless, it seems sufficient to resolve the described issue.\n\nCommon mistakes not detected in this patch:\n- Incorrectly identifying lines to remove.\n- Overcomplicating the logic without addressing the problem effectively.\n\nNo such issues appear in the current review.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

The modifications are made within the function `AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert`, which is responsible for handling and rewriting assertions' AST (Abstract Syntax Tree), directly related to the issue described.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not appear to introduce any new issues. Subtracting 1 from `assert_.lineno` should correctly correlate to the line number of the actual assertion, eliminating the extra code line being printed in error messages without conflicting with the logic of identified code spans.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch seems adequate to fix the issue described. It targets the problematic statement where an incorrect line number was causing additional code to appear in error messages. The only narrow concern may be whether this approach of subtracting 1 from `assert_.lineno` consistently applies across diversified coding structures handled by AST. This logic targets the identified issue of Python version discrepancy adequately.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

Filtering out decorator lines in ReprEntry prevents printing unnecessary information in assertion failed messages. The fix in `getstatementrange_ast` has added behavior such that only assertion lines count instead of including decorators. This sounds reasonable, decreases debug complexity, and is well within AST standards.\n\nCommon mistakes for LLM-generated patches such as targeting wrong functions, introducing syntax errors, overly broad catch statements, unnecessary logging or distracting warnings, are absent here. The patch effectively nails the main issue regarding line superscripts.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"

This behavior is not observed in Python 3.7. The issue description suggests there might be an error related to the calculation of the statement's start or end line number during processing.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>[AssertionRewritingHook, AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert]</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **AssertionRewritingHook**: This is the import hook that rewrites asserts. This part is conceptually relevant because the issue likely stems from the way assertions are rewritten. However, specific modifications in this class are not directly related to fixing the line inclusion problem.\n2. **AssertionRewriter.visit_Assert**: This method rewrites `assert` statements to provide additional detail on assertion failures. It manipulates assertions by replacing them with `if` statements combined with `AssertionError` raising. This method is closely related to the issue because it directly processes `assert` statements and includes line numbers in the rewritten assertions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Hunk A new file**: The patch introduces entirely new dummy files annotated potentially for backup purposes. No relevance.\n\n2. **Hunk in `src/_pytest/_code/source.py` and `src/_pytest/_code/code.py`**:\n   - **src/_pytest/_code/code.py**: Introduced converters to `ReprEntry` class\u2019s initialization to disallow lines beginning with the \u201c@\u201d symbol from being included.

Adjustment defaults interpolate correctly.\n2. Line filtering/exclusion logic meshes intimately but doesn't contradict assertion handling classes (right points change).\nThus no interferences from identifiers.\n\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch fixes the issue effectively by excluding unnecessary decorator lines from the error traceback while processing assertions in two primary places:\n1. Removing decorator lines directly when printing traceback lines (`ReprEntry`).\n2. Adjusting ranges to skip upon assertions excluding decorator lines properly initiates assertions strip-ups.\n\nThe fix aligns with domain knowledge avoiding redundant scopes parsing (inspect POST DEL2).\n\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>9</score>"
