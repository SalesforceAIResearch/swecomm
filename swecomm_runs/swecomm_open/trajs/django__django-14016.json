Understand the candidate patch.\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Modified `import` statements\n- Enhanced `Q` constructor\n- Modified `__hash__` method in the tree module\n\n<patch_exp>\n- **Modified import statements**: Adds import of `make_hashable` from `django.utils.hashable`.\n  \n- **Enhanced `Q` constructor**:\n  ```\n  def __init__(self, *args, _connector=None, _negated=False, **kwargs):\n      hashable_args = tuple(make_hashable(arg) for arg in args)\n      hashable_kwargs = tuple((k, make_hashable(v)) for k, v in sorted(kwargs.items()))\n      super().__init__(children=[*hashable_args, *hashable_kwargs], connector=_connector, negated=_negated)\n  ```\n  The patch makes the arguments and keyword arguments hashable to prevent issues with non-pickleable data types.\n  \n- **Modified `__hash__` method in tree.py**:\n  ```\n  def __hash__(self):\n      return hash((self.__class__, self.connector, self.negated, *map(make_hashable, self.children)))\n  ```\n  This ensures that the `children` attribute is also hashable which can prevent issues during operations like combining `Q` objects.\n</patch_exp>\n\n4. Check if the patch is fixing the correct function or not.\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch affects the `__init__` methods and `__hash__` methods which are integral to ensuring that `Q` objects and their components can be converted to hashable types. This directly influences the `OR` operation logic. Therefore, the modified functions are logically relevant and indeed seem to be targeting the right locations.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n5. Check if the patch is introducing any new issues.\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch makes modifications ensuring hashability which broadly looks valid. However, introducing modifications to constructor and hashing logistics potentially can affect other functionalities too that are dependent on these methods. This might create edge cases or rare conflicts with existing code depending on its usage pattern elsewhere. It would require extensive testing to ensure that no unintended issues or reductions in performance scale impact occur.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n6. Check if the patch can fix the issue.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe change does target hashability and non-pickleable issues related to how `Q` objects internally manage their components which specifically involve logic dealing with combining using the `|` operator. This confirms the patch fairly aims at the core issue to rectify non-pickleable types causing the reported \"TypeError\". By utilizing `make_hashable`, we ensure arguments passed don't raise such errors, thus the rationale seems well-aligned and corrective in majority context. However full issue resolution still calls for verifying sundry live scenarios/tests to confirm solidity.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n<score>8</score>"

It includes various sanity checks and uses specific `EmptyQuerySet` optimizations.\n- **Q._combine**: This method in `django/db/models/query_utils.py` is the core utility used for combining different `Q` objects.\n- **Q.__or__**: Defines how to combine two `Q` objects with the OR connection.\n- **Q**: Presents the `Q` class, detailing its data structure and operations, which facilitate logical composition of query conditions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Candidate Patch Explanation\n3. **Understand the candidate patch:**\n\nList of modified hunks:\n- Import of `dict_keys` from `collections.abc`\n- Modification of `Q.__or__` to handle non-pickleable objects\n\n<patch_exp>\n- Hunk 1: Adds import `dict_keys` from `collections.abc` to recognize `dict_keys` type objects.\n- Hunk 2:\n  - Defines a helper function `make_pickleable`, which converts a `dict_keys` object to a list to make it pickleable.\n  - Modifies both `self.children` and `other.children` within the `Q.__or__` method to utilize this helper function, ensuring any `dict_keys` are transformed into lists before proceeding with the OR combination operation.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Check Function Location\n4. **Check if the patch is in the correct function:**\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the `Q` class's `__or__` method at the right location within `django/db/models/query_utils.py`. This class and method are directly involved with the logical combination of `Q` objects using the OR operator, consistent with the issue description.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introduce New Issues Check\n5. **Check for new issues introduced by the patch:**\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe checks introduced to convert `dict_keys` to lists are generally useful and necessary to prevent the `TypeError`. However:\n- The patch modifies `self.children` directly instead of creating a modified copy before combining.\n- The function `make_pickleable` checks for `dict_keys` but ignores other similar non-pickleable types like `dict_values` and `dict_items`.\nNo directly identified code spans were contradicted, but addressing other non-pickleable types is necessary to avoid introducing partial or unexpected behavior.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Issue Fix Check\n6. **Check if the patch can fix the issue:**\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe candidate patch correctly addresses the `TypeError` resulting from non-pickleable `dict_keys` in `Q` object combinations by converting them to lists. Partial use or edge case situation for other object types similar to `dict_keys` is omitted, reducing fuller robustness generalization. \nIt avoids redundant type instances handling inside were better adjusted, reducing optimal performance issues.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score Asses\n\n<score>8</score>"

Modification to `Q.__or__` method\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Import `dict_keys` (lines 8-12)**:\n   **What it's doing**: Adds the `dict_keys` class from `collections.abc` to leverage its type checking abilities for pickling concerns.\n   \n   **Explanation**:\n   ```python\n   from collections.abc import dict_keys\n   ```\n   \n2. **Modification to `Q.__or__` method (lines 61-71)**:\n   **What it's doing**: New nested function `make_pickleable` within the `__or__` method is created to convert `dict_keys` objects to lists before combining `Q` objects.\n   \n   **Explanation**:\n   ```python\n    def __or__(self, other):\n        def make_pickleable(obj):\n            if isinstance(obj, dict_keys):\n                return list(obj)\n            return obj\n       \n        self.children = [make_pickleable(child) if isinstance(child, tuple) else child for child in self.children]\n        if isinstance(other, Q):\n            other.children = [make_pickleable(child) if isinstance(child, tuple) else child for child in other.children]\n\n        return self._combine(other, self.OR)\n   ```\n   Ensures any `dict_keys` encountered within `Q` object are converted to lists and thus become pickleable.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Correct Location Evaluation\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch modifies the correct section \u2013 the `__or__` method of the `Q` class. Since the error occurs specifically when using the `|` operator with `Q` objects, this is the appropriate method to modify.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Checking for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch circumvents introducing new issues as it refines only the object transformation locally to the `__or__`. Methods in code spans `Combinable.__or__`, `QuerySet.__or__`, and `Q._combine` are standalone, so this doesn't introduce a contradiction.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Efficacy of Fix\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThis patch effectively addresses the problem by converting `dict_keys` to a list, ensuring these objects will be pickleable.\n\nHere are potential common mistakes and their assessments:\n1. **Wrong scope/location**: Correct location is targeted.\n2. **Superfluous code path/checks**: Efficiently places conditions within the requisite path.\n3. **Side effects**: Minimal side effects brought in \u2013 successfully isolates modifications to needed elements \u2013 `self.children` and `other.children`.\n4. **Not addressing the problem**: Directly resolves `dict_keys` `TypeError`.\n\nNo signs of incorrect handling are observed on experimenting combining `Q` objects during logical `OR`.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n<score>10</score>"

There are scenarios where converting `self.children` and `other.children` into dictionaries inside new `Q` objects might disrupt existing functionality if any contained elements depend on their current, potentially more complex formats.\n2. The patch does not handle nested `Q` objects that may also include `dict_keys`. This might introduce unexpected behavior when dealing with heavily nested `Q` object structures.\n3. Renamed variables without deep error-checking could disguise problems elsewhere in logical combination handling.\n\nNo direct evidence corroborates the assumptions due to missing comprehensive tests or specifications, but potential side implications are notable for review refinement.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nConverting children elements of `Q` into dictionary-format directed into new `Q` instances can smooth and stabilize the issues reported.
