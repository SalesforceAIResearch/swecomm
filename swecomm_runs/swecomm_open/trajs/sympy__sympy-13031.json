Specifically, the shapes of horizontally stacked empty matrices (having non-zero columns but zero rows) differs between these versions, causing inconsistency in expected outputs.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\nList of span IDs: MatrixShaping, MatrixShaping.row_join, MatrixShaping.hstack\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- `MatrixShaping` (span_id=MatrixShaping): This spans a class providing basic matrix shaping functions.

Addressed here due to the behavior change observed.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks: \n1. Modification at line 381-384 in `hstack` function.\n2. Modification at line 607-610 in `vstack` function.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. Addition of a condition in `hstack` to check if all input matrices have zero rows and, if true, creates a new matrix with zero rows and the combined columns of the input matrices:\n   - Before Patch:\n     ```\n     kls = type(args[0])\n     return reduce(kls.row_join, args)\n     ```\n   - After Patch:\n     ```\n     kls = type(args[0])\n     if all(arg.rows == 0 for arg in args):\n         total_cols = sum(arg.cols for arg in args)\n         return cls._new(0, total_cols, [])\n     return reduce(kls.row_join, args)\n     ```\n2.

The problem is with `hstack` and `vstack`, and the patch modifies these functions directly to handle the edge cases reported in the issue.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check if the Patch is Introducing New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe modification does not seem to contradict any identified code spans. However, there should be unit tests verifying these changes to ensure no unintended side effects occur with the new logic.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch is reasonable for the described issue as it directly modifies the logic in the hstack and vstack methods to correctly handle matrices with zero rows or zero columns. It uses conditions to handle cases where all arguments either have zero rows or baseline zero columns, which aligns with the behavior discrepancy stated in the issue description. Potential pitfalls like off-by-one errors or not handling other edge cases seem managed correctly by summing column or row counts respectively.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Score\n<score>8</score>"

                    "msg": "### Issue Understanding\nThe core issue reported is the change in behavior of the `Matrix.hstack` function in sympy version 1.1 compared to version 1.0. In sympy 1.0, horizontally stacking four matrices, all with the last dimension having size 0 initially returns a shape of `(0, 6)`, whereas in sympy 1.1, it returns `(0, 3)`. Stacking matrices with the first dimension greater than 0 results in correct behavior, exemplified by a shape of `(1, 6)`.\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue is about a change in behavior of the `Matrix.hstack` method between sympy 1.0 and 1.1. In sympy 1.0, horizontally stacking multiple matrices with no columns would sum the total columns correctly, while the same code in sympy 1.1 does not produce the intended column count for matrices with zero dimensions.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Code Span Understanding\nSpan IDs: `MatrixShaping`, `MatrixShaping.row_join`, `MatrixShaping.hstack`\n\n1. **MatrixShaping**\n   - Defines the root class providing methods concerning matrix shaping and submatrix extraction. It\u2019s relevant as `hstack` is a method involved in modifying the shape of the matrices.\n\n2. **MatrixShaping.row_join**\n   - The `row_join` method is responsible for concatenating matrices horizontally, an essential operation when calling `hstack` which utilizes repeated calls to `row_join`. This span shows the nuances in handling edge cases like null matrices, directly relevant to the issue.\n\n3. **MatrixShaping.hstack**\n    - This is the class method combining matrices by joining them horizontally using `row_join`. Understanding its implementation helps clarify why the zero-sized column matrix stacking changed from sympy 1.0 to 1.1.\n\n<code_span_exp>\nThe relevant spans indicate the core building blocks required for the `hstack` operation. \n- `MatrixShaping` class provides context on methods used within matrix operations like `hstack`.\n- `row_join` method is central in combining matrices horizontally, a key operation in resolving the `hstack` issue.\n- `hstack` outlines how multiple matrices are combined horizontally using `row_join` and clarifies the implementation approached typically and possibly changed over versions.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Patch Understanding\nModified hunks: \n1. The change within `MatrixShaping.row_join`\n\n#### Patch Explanation:\n- **Hunk Location: `sympy/matrices/common.py` (function `row_join`)**\n  - The patch adds an additional conditional to address instances of null matrices (`self.cols==0`). It now ensures it returns `other` if `self` has zero rows or `self.rows` and `other.rows` match, otherwise invoking `row_join` as needed. \n\n<patch_exp>\nChanges in `sympy/matrices/common.py` at the function `row_join` added checks for column size zero matrices. When columns are zero, it no longer haphazardly combines but specifically returns `other` or row joins only if sizes match appropriately.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Correct Location Check\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch correctly targets the relevant `row_join` method within `MatrixShaping`, which is directly involved in handling matrix concatenation for `hstack` methods.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Introduction of New Issues Check\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not seem to introduce new issues or contradict the existing behavior described in the code spans. The conditional modification respects the logic in previously setrow logic and those for empty matrices handling appropriately.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Effectiveness of Patch\n<fix_issue_exp>\nWhile the patch addresses one condition in `row_join`, the issue extends into cumulative operations like repeated Class method calls of hstack operations, potentially unchecked originally alongside evolving to +eps on test matrices. Still thorough impact via extensive input set not validated seems y discrepancy check handling expansion needed most managing during.

                    "msg": "Let's analyze the given information and follow the steps as instructed.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Issue\n\n<issue_exp>\nThe issue concerns a change in behavior of the `Matrix.hstack` method between sympy versions 1.0 and 1.1. Specifically, in sympy 1.0, horizontally stacking multiple matrices where all matrices had zero rows worked correctly, returning a combined matrix with a correct column count. However, in sympy 1.1, this behavior changed, resulting in incorrect shapes for some stacked matrices with zero rows. For instance, `Matrix.hstack(M1, M2, M3, M4)` would return `(0, 6)` in version 1.0 but `(0, 3)` in version 1.1, which is not desired.\n</issue_exp>\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Identified Code Spans\n\n- Identified code span IDs:\n  - MatrixShaping\n  - MatrixShaping.row_join\n  - MatrixShaping.hstack\n\n<code_span_exp>\n1. **MatrixShaping**:\n   - This class provides basic matrix shaping and extraction subroutines, ensuring that the code related to matrix stacking and joining is defined and managed within it.\n  \n2. **MatrixShaping.row_join**:\n   - This method is crucial because it defines how two matrices are concatenated (joined) horizontally along columns. An identified line in this method explains how a null matrix is always stackable, which specifically impacts the joining behavior of matrices with zero rows.\n\n3. **MatrixShaping.hstack**:\n   - This class method constructs a matrix by joining several matrices horizontally by repeatedly applying the `row_join` method. This span directly relates to the combination of the matrices which is the focus of the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n### Step 3: Understand the Candidate Patch\n\nList of modified hunks:\n1. Changes in `sympy/matrices/matrices.py` file, adding conditions to handle matrices with zero rows before calling `hstack`.\n\n<patch_exp>\n1. **Modified Hunk**:\n   - The patch introduces a conditional check from line number 1461 to see if all matrices in `jordan_basis` have zero rows. If they do, it creates an appropriate zero matrix of the same combined column size as before using `mat.zeros(0, sum(m.cols for m in jordan_basis))`. This matrix simulates the correct expected shape.\n   - If not all matrices have zero rows, it falls back to the original behavior by concatenating the matrices using `mat.hstack(*jordan_basis)`.\n</patch_exp>\n\n### Step 4: Check Correct Location of the Patch\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nThe patch modifies the code at the end of a function defining a basis matrix within the SymPy matrix class module which includes calculating eigenvalues/eigenvectors. Given the interoperability shown in the issue and code related to how matrix stacks are recreated, the added conditional correctly addresses how matrices with zero rows and variable columns should behave during the horizontal stack process.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n### Step 5: Check for New Issues\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThe patch does not introduce any new contradictions with the existing identified code spans. It correctly adds handling for when all matrices have zero rows and constructs a correct zero-size matrix combining the total number of columns.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n### Step 6: Check if the Patch Can Fix the Issue\n\nThe patch sensibly adds the condition to fix the matrix stacking issue for matrices with zero rows, making sure that the combined matrix shape is appropriately generated even when stacking zero-size rows. The error is handled by completely circumventing the default `hstack` method that causes wrong results.\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch resolves the primary issue by properly handling scenarios where matrices have zero rows without falling into the common LLM-generated code mistakes such as wrong logic or breaking existing functionality. It achieves this by pre-empting its h flipping mechanism according to the number of zero-row matrices and mergeting column sizes correctly.\n</fix_issue_exp>\n\n### Final Score\n\n<score>9</score>"

However, in version 1.1, the output shape appears incorrect for zero-row inputs, not summing up the columns properly.\n</issue_exp>\n\n<span_ids>\nMatrixShaping\nMatrixShaping.row_join\nMatrixShaping.hstack\n</span_ids>\n\n<code_span_exp>\n- **MatrixShaping**: This class provides the foundational operations on matrices, including shaping and extracting submatrices, so understanding how various matrix manipulations are implemented will help address the issue.\n  \n- **MatrixShaping.row_join**: This method is responsible for concatenating two matrices along their horizontal axis (rows). Notably, it includes logic for handling null matrices, which is pertinent to the issue at hand regarding different behaviors in matrix concatenation functions.\n  \n- **MatrixShaping.hstack**: This class method joins multiple matrices horizontally using the `row_join` method. Since the issue arose when multiple zero-row matrices were horizontally stacked, modifications or behavior checks in this method could directly address the issue.\n</code_span_exp>\n\n<modified_hunks>\n1.

If so, instead of using `mat.hstack`, a zero-input matrix with row dimension zero and columns combined from all bases is created.\n</patch_exp>\n\n<correct_location_exp>\nYes, the patch is applied to the correct location in the file `matrices.py` where the method dealing with basis matrix preparation and specifically handles matrix joining/typesetting which interacts with `Matrix.hstack`.\n</correct_location_exp>\n\n<new_issues_exp>\nThere do not appear to be any new issues or contradictions with the identified code spans in this patch. The logic applies an edge-case check only when necessary and leaves default behavior unchanged.\n</new_issues_exp>\n\n<fix_issue_exp>\nThe patch addresses the issue technically by adding a special case handling for zero-row matrices before attempting to horizontally stack them, hence correctly shaping the matrix expected behavior as documented.
