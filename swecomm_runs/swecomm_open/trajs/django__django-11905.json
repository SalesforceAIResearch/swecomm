It builds on the\n+material presented in the :doc:`model </topics/db/models>` and :doc:`database\n+query </topics/db/queries>` guides, so you'll probably want to read and\n+understand those documents before reading this one.\n+\n+Throughout this reference we'll use the :ref:`example Weblog models\n+<queryset-model-example>` presented in the :doc:`database query guide\n+</topics/db/queries>`.\n+\n+.. _when-querysets-are-evaluated:\n+\n+When ``QuerySet``\\s are evaluated\n+=================================\n+\n+Internally, a ``QuerySet`` can be constructed, filtered, sliced, and generally\n+passed around without actually hitting the database. No database activity\n+actually occurs until you do something to evaluate the queryset.\n+\n+You can evaluate a ``QuerySet`` in the following ways:\n+\n+* **Iteration.** A ``QuerySet`` is iterable, and it executes its database\n+  query the first time you iterate over it. For example, this will print\n+  the headline of all entries in the database::\n+\n+      for e in Entry.objects.all():\n+          print(e.headline)\n+\n+  Note: Don't use this if all you want to do is determine if at least one\n+  result exists. It's more efficient to use :meth:`~QuerySet.exists`.\n+\n+* **Slicing.** As explained in :ref:`limiting-querysets`, a ``QuerySet`` can\n+  be sliced, using Python's array-slicing syntax. Slicing an unevaluated\n+  ``QuerySet`` usually returns another unevaluated ``QuerySet``, but Django\n+  will execute the database query if you use the \"step\" parameter of slice\n+  syntax, and will return a list. Slicing a ``QuerySet`` that has been\n+  evaluated also returns a list.\n+\n+  Also note that even though slicing an unevaluated ``QuerySet`` returns\n+  another unevaluated ``QuerySet``, modifying it further (e.g., adding\n+  more filters, or modifying ordering) is not allowed, since that does not\n+  translate well into SQL and it would not have a clear meaning either.\n+\n+* **Pickling/Caching.** See the following section for details of what\n+  is involved when `pickling QuerySets`_. The important thing for the\n+  purposes of this section is that the results are read from the database.\n+\n+* **repr().** A ``QuerySet`` is evaluated when you call ``repr()`` on it.\n+  This is for convenience in the Python interactive interpreter, so you can\n+  immediately see your results when using the API interactively.\n+\n+* **len().** A ``QuerySet`` is evaluated when you call ``len()`` on it.\n+  This, as you might expect, returns the length of the result list.\n+\n+  Note: If you only need to determine the number of records in the set (and\n+  don't need the actual objects), it's much more efficient to handle a count\n+  at the database level using SQL's ``SELECT COUNT(*)``. Django provides a\n+  :meth:`~QuerySet.count` method for precisely this reason.\n+\n+* **list().** Force evaluation of a ``QuerySet`` by calling ``list()`` on\n+  it. For example::\n+\n+      entry_list = list(Entry.objects.all())\n+\n+* **bool().** Testing a ``QuerySet`` in a boolean context, such as using\n+  ``bool()``, ``or``, ``and`` or an ``if`` statement, will cause the query\n+  to be executed. If there is at least one result, the ``QuerySet`` is\n+  ``True``, otherwise ``False``. For example::\n+\n+      if Entry.objects.filter(headline=\"Test\"):\n+         print(\"There is at least one Entry with the headline Test\")\n+\n+  Note: If you only want to determine if at least one result exists (and don't\n+  need the actual objects), it's more efficient to use :meth:`~QuerySet.exists`.\n+\n+.. _pickling QuerySets:\n+\n+Pickling ``QuerySet``\\s\n+-----------------------\n+\n+If you :mod:`pickle` a ``QuerySet``, this will force all the results to be loaded\n+into memory prior to pickling. Pickling is usually used as a precursor to\n+caching and when the cached queryset is reloaded, you want the results to\n+already be present and ready for use (reading from the database can take some\n+time, defeating the purpose of caching). This means that when you unpickle a\n+``QuerySet``, it contains the results at the moment it was pickled, rather\n+than the results that are currently in the database.\n+\n+If you only want to pickle the necessary information to recreate the\n+``QuerySet`` from the database at a later time, pickle the ``query`` attribute\n+of the ``QuerySet``. You can then recreate the original ``QuerySet`` (without\n+any results loaded) using some code like this::\n+\n+    >>> import pickle\n+    >>> query = pickle.loads(s)     # Assuming 's' is the pickled string.\n+    >>> qs = MyModel.objects.all()\n+    >>> qs.query = query            # Restore the original 'query'.\n+\n+The ``query`` attribute is an opaque object. It represents the internals of\n+the query construction and is not part of the public API. However, it is safe\n+(and fully supported) to pickle and unpickle the attribute's contents as\n+described here.\n+\n+.. admonition:: You can't share pickles between versions\n+\n+    Pickles of ``QuerySets`` are only valid for the version of Django that\n+    was used to generate them. If you generate a pickle using Django\n+    version N, there is no guarantee that pickle will be readable with\n+    Django version N+1. Pickles should not be used as part of a long-term\n+    archival strategy.\n+\n+    Since pickle compatibility errors can be difficult to diagnose, such as\n+    silently corrupted objects, a ``RuntimeWarning`` is raised when you try to\n+    unpickle a queryset in a Django version that is different than the one in\n+    which it was pickled.\n+\n+.. _queryset-api:\n+\n+``QuerySet`` API\n+================\n+\n+Here's the formal declaration of a ``QuerySet``:\n+\n+.. class:: QuerySet(model=None, query=None, using=None)\n+\n+    Usually when you'll interact with a ``QuerySet`` you'll use it by\n+    :ref:`chaining filters <chaining-filters>`. To make this work, most\n+    ``QuerySet`` methods return new querysets. These methods are covered in\n+    detail later in this section.\n+\n+    The ``QuerySet`` class has two public attributes you can use for\n+    introspection:\n+\n+    .. attribute:: ordered\n+\n+        ``True`` if the ``QuerySet`` is ordered \u2014 i.e. has an\n+        :meth:`order_by()` clause or a default ordering on the model.\n+        ``False`` otherwise.\n+\n+    .. attribute:: db\n+\n+        The database that will be used if this query is executed now.\n+\n+    .. note::\n+\n+        The ``query`` parameter to :class:`QuerySet` exists so that specialized\n+        query subclasses can reconstruct internal query state. The value of the\n+        parameter is an opaque representation of that query state and is not\n+        part of a public API. To put it another way: if you need to ask, you\n+        don't need to use it.\n+\n+.. currentmodule:: django.db.models.query.QuerySet\n+\n+Methods that return new ``QuerySet``\\s\n+--------------------------------------\n+\n+Django provides a range of ``QuerySet`` refinement methods that modify either\n+the types of results returned by the ``QuerySet`` or the way its SQL query is\n+executed.\n+\n+``filter()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: filter(**kwargs)\n+\n+Returns a new ``QuerySet`` containing objects that match the given lookup\n+parameters.\n+\n+The lookup parameters (``**kwargs``) should be in the format described in\n+`Field lookups`_ below. Multiple parameters are joined via ``AND`` in the\n+underlying SQL statement.\n+\n+If you need to execute more complex queries (for example, queries with ``OR`` statements),\n+you can use :class:`Q objects <django.db.models.Q>`.\n+\n+``exclude()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: exclude(**kwargs)\n+\n+Returns a new ``QuerySet`` containing objects that do *not* match the given\n+lookup parameters.\n+\n+The lookup parameters (``**kwargs``) should be in the format described in\n+`Field lookups`_ below. Multiple parameters are joined via ``AND`` in the\n+underlying SQL statement, and the whole thing is enclosed in a ``NOT()``.\n+\n+This example excludes all entries whose ``pub_date`` is later than 2005-1-3\n+AND whose ``headline`` is \"Hello\"::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.exclude(pub_date__gt=datetime.date(2005, 1, 3), headline='Hello')\n+\n+In SQL terms, that evaluates to:\n+\n+.. code-block:: sql\n+\n+    SELECT ...\n+    WHERE NOT (pub_date > '2005-1-3' AND headline = 'Hello')\n+\n+This example excludes all entries whose ``pub_date`` is later than 2005-1-3\n+OR whose headline is \"Hello\"::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.exclude(pub_date__gt=datetime.date(2005, 1, 3)).exclude(headline='Hello')\n+\n+In SQL terms, that evaluates to:\n+\n+.. code-block:: sql\n+\n+    SELECT ...\n+    WHERE NOT pub_date > '2005-1-3'\n+    AND NOT headline = 'Hello'\n+\n+Note the second example is more restrictive.\n+\n+If you need to execute more complex queries (for example, queries with ``OR`` statements),\n+you can use :class:`Q objects <django.db.models.Q>`.\n+\n+``annotate()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: annotate(*args, **kwargs)\n+\n+Annotates each object in the ``QuerySet`` with the provided list of :doc:`query\n+expressions </ref/models/expressions>`. An expression may be a simple value, a\n+reference to a field on the model (or any related models), or an aggregate\n+expression (averages, sums, etc.) that has been computed over the objects that\n+are related to the objects in the ``QuerySet``.\n+\n+Each argument to ``annotate()`` is an annotation that will be added\n+to each object in the ``QuerySet`` that is returned.\n+\n+The aggregation functions that are provided by Django are described\n+in `Aggregation Functions`_ below.\n+\n+Annotations specified using keyword arguments will use the keyword as\n+the alias for the annotation. Anonymous arguments will have an alias\n+generated for them based upon the name of the aggregate function and\n+the model field that is being aggregated. Only aggregate expressions\n+that reference a single field can be anonymous arguments. Everything\n+else must be a keyword argument.\n+\n+For example, if you were manipulating a list of blogs, you may want\n+to determine how many entries have been made in each blog::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import Count\n+    >>> q = Blog.objects.annotate(Count('entry'))\n+    # The name of the first blog\n+    >>> q[0].name\n+    'Blogasaurus'\n+    # The number of entries on the first blog\n+    >>> q[0].entry__count\n+    42\n+\n+The ``Blog`` model doesn't define an ``entry__count`` attribute by itself,\n+but by using a keyword argument to specify the aggregate function, you can\n+control the name of the annotation::\n+\n+    >>> q = Blog.objects.annotate(number_of_entries=Count('entry'))\n+    # The number of entries on the first blog, using the name provided\n+    >>> q[0].number_of_entries\n+    42\n+\n+For an in-depth discussion of aggregation, see :doc:`the topic guide on\n+Aggregation </topics/db/aggregation>`.\n+\n+``order_by()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: order_by(*fields)\n+\n+By default, results returned by a ``QuerySet`` are ordered by the ordering\n+tuple given by the ``ordering`` option in the model's ``Meta``. You can\n+override this on a per-``QuerySet`` basis by using the ``order_by`` method.\n+\n+Example::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2005).order_by('-pub_date', 'headline')\n+\n+The result above will be ordered by ``pub_date`` descending, then by\n+``headline`` ascending. The negative sign in front of ``\"-pub_date\"`` indicates\n+*descending* order. Ascending order is implied. To order randomly, use ``\"?\"``,\n+like so::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by('?')\n+\n+Note: ``order_by('?')`` queries may be expensive and slow, depending on the\n+database backend you're using.\n+\n+To order by a field in a different model, use the same syntax as when you are\n+querying across model relations. That is, the name of the field, followed by a\n+double underscore (``__``), followed by the name of the field in the new model,\n+and so on for as many models as you want to join. For example::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by('blog__name', 'headline')\n+\n+If you try to order by a field that is a relation to another model, Django will\n+use the default ordering on the related model, or order by the related model's\n+primary key if there is no :attr:`Meta.ordering\n+<django.db.models.Options.ordering>` specified. For example, since the ``Blog``\n+model has no default ordering specified::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by('blog')\n+\n+...is identical to::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by('blog__id')\n+\n+If ``Blog`` had ``ordering = ['name']``, then the first queryset would be\n+identical to::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by('blog__name')\n+\n+You can also order by :doc:`query expressions </ref/models/expressions>` by\n+calling :meth:`~.Expression.asc` or :meth:`~.Expression.desc` on the\n+expression::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by(Coalesce('summary', 'headline').desc())\n+\n+:meth:`~.Expression.asc` and :meth:`~.Expression.desc` have arguments\n+(``nulls_first`` and ``nulls_last``) that control how null values are sorted.\n+\n+Be cautious when ordering by fields in related models if you are also using\n+:meth:`distinct()`. See the note in :meth:`distinct` for an explanation of how\n+related model ordering can change the expected results.\n+\n+.. note::\n+    It is permissible to specify a multi-valued field to order the results by\n+    (for example, a :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` field, or the\n+    reverse relation of a :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey` field).\n+\n+    Consider this case::\n+\n+         class Event(Model):\n+            parent = models.ForeignKey(\n+                'self',\n+                on_delete=models.CASCADE,\n+                related_name='children',\n+            )\n+            date = models.DateField()\n+\n+         Event.objects.order_by('children__date')\n+\n+    Here, there could potentially be multiple ordering data for each ``Event``;\n+    each ``Event`` with multiple ``children`` will be returned multiple times\n+    into the new ``QuerySet`` that ``order_by()`` creates. In other words,\n+    using ``order_by()`` on the ``QuerySet`` could return more items than you\n+    were working on to begin with - which is probably neither expected nor\n+    useful.\n+\n+    Thus, take care when using multi-valued field to order the results. **If**\n+    you can be sure that there will only be one ordering piece of data for each\n+    of the items you're ordering, this approach should not present problems. If\n+    not, make sure the results are what you expect.\n+\n+There's no way to specify whether ordering should be case sensitive. With\n+respect to case-sensitivity, Django will order results however your database\n+backend normally orders them.\n+\n+You can order by a field converted to lowercase with\n+:class:`~django.db.models.functions.Lower` which will achieve case-consistent\n+ordering::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by(Lower('headline').desc())\n+\n+If you don't want any ordering to be applied to a query, not even the default\n+ordering, call :meth:`order_by()` with no parameters.\n+\n+You can tell if a query is ordered or not by checking the\n+:attr:`.QuerySet.ordered` attribute, which will be ``True`` if the\n+``QuerySet`` has been ordered in any way.\n+\n+Each ``order_by()`` call will clear any previous ordering. For example, this\n+query will be ordered by ``pub_date`` and not ``headline``::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.order_by('headline').order_by('pub_date')\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    Ordering is not a free operation. Each field you add to the ordering\n+    incurs a cost to your database. Each foreign key you add will\n+    implicitly include all of its default orderings as well.\n+\n+    If a query doesn't have an ordering specified, results are returned from\n+    the database in an unspecified order. A particular ordering is guaranteed\n+    only when ordering by a set of fields that uniquely identify each object in\n+    the results. For example, if a ``name`` field isn't unique, ordering by it\n+    won't guarantee objects with the same name always appear in the same order.\n+\n+``reverse()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: reverse()\n+\n+Use the ``reverse()`` method to reverse the order in which a queryset's\n+elements are returned. Calling ``reverse()`` a second time restores the\n+ordering back to the normal direction.\n+\n+To retrieve the \"last\" five items in a queryset, you could do this::\n+\n+    my_queryset.reverse()[:5]\n+\n+Note that this is not quite the same as slicing from the end of a sequence in\n+Python. The above example will return the last item first, then the\n+penultimate item and so on. If we had a Python sequence and looked at\n+``seq[-5:]``, we would see the fifth-last item first. Django doesn't support\n+that mode of access (slicing from the end), because it's not possible to do it\n+efficiently in SQL.\n+\n+Also, note that ``reverse()`` should generally only be called on a ``QuerySet``\n+which has a defined ordering (e.g., when querying against a model which defines\n+a default ordering, or when using :meth:`order_by()`). If no such ordering is\n+defined for a given ``QuerySet``, calling ``reverse()`` on it has no real\n+effect (the ordering was undefined prior to calling ``reverse()``, and will\n+remain undefined afterward).\n+\n+``distinct()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: distinct(*fields)\n+\n+Returns a new ``QuerySet`` that uses ``SELECT DISTINCT`` in its SQL query. This\n+eliminates duplicate rows from the query results.\n+\n+By default, a ``QuerySet`` will not eliminate duplicate rows. In practice, this\n+is rarely a problem, because simple queries such as ``Blog.objects.all()``\n+don't introduce the possibility of duplicate result rows. However, if your\n+query spans multiple tables, it's possible to get duplicate results when a\n+``QuerySet`` is evaluated. That's when you'd use ``distinct()``.\n+\n+.. note::\n+    Any fields used in an :meth:`order_by` call are included in the SQL\n+    ``SELECT`` columns. This can sometimes lead to unexpected results when used\n+    in conjunction with ``distinct()``. If you order by fields from a related\n+    model, those fields will be added to the selected columns and they may make\n+    otherwise duplicate rows appear to be distinct. Since the extra columns\n+    don't appear in the returned results (they are only there to support\n+    ordering), it sometimes looks like non-distinct results are being returned.\n+\n+    Similarly, if you use a :meth:`values()` query to restrict the columns\n+    selected, the columns used in any :meth:`order_by()` (or default model\n+    ordering) will still be involved and may affect uniqueness of the results.\n+\n+    The moral here is that if you are using ``distinct()`` be careful about\n+    ordering by related models. Similarly, when using ``distinct()`` and\n+    :meth:`values()` together, be careful when ordering by fields not in the\n+    :meth:`values()` call.\n+\n+On PostgreSQL only, you can pass positional arguments (``*fields``) in order to\n+specify the names of fields to which the ``DISTINCT`` should apply. This\n+translates to a ``SELECT DISTINCT ON`` SQL query. Here's the difference. For a\n+normal ``distinct()`` call, the database compares *each* field in each row when\n+determining which rows are distinct. For a ``distinct()`` call with specified\n+field names, the database will only compare the specified field names.\n+\n+.. note::\n+    When you specify field names, you *must* provide an ``order_by()`` in the\n+    ``QuerySet``, and the fields in ``order_by()`` must start with the fields in\n+    ``distinct()``, in the same order.\n+\n+    For example, ``SELECT DISTINCT ON (a)`` gives you the first row for each\n+    value in column ``a``. If you don't specify an order, you'll get some\n+    arbitrary row.\n+\n+Examples (those after the first will only work on PostgreSQL)::\n+\n+    >>> Author.objects.distinct()\n+    [...]\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.order_by('pub_date').distinct('pub_date')\n+    [...]\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.order_by('blog').distinct('blog')\n+    [...]\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.order_by('author', 'pub_date').distinct('author', 'pub_date')\n+    [...]\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.order_by('blog__name', 'mod_date').distinct('blog__name', 'mod_date')\n+    [...]\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.order_by('author', 'pub_date').distinct('author')\n+    [...]\n+\n+.. note::\n+    Keep in mind that :meth:`order_by` uses any default related model ordering\n+    that has been defined. You might have to explicitly order by the relation\n+    ``_id`` or referenced field to make sure the ``DISTINCT ON`` expressions\n+    match those at the beginning of the ``ORDER BY`` clause. For example, if\n+    the ``Blog`` model defined an :attr:`~django.db.models.Options.ordering` by\n+    ``name``::\n+\n+        Entry.objects.order_by('blog').distinct('blog')\n+\n+    ...wouldn't work because the query would be ordered by ``blog__name`` thus\n+    mismatching the ``DISTINCT ON`` expression. You'd have to explicitly order\n+    by the relation `_id` field (``blog_id`` in this case) or the referenced\n+    one (``blog__pk``) to make sure both expressions match.\n+\n+``values()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: values(*fields, **expressions)\n+\n+Returns a ``QuerySet`` that returns dictionaries, rather than model instances,\n+when used as an iterable.\n+\n+Each of those dictionaries represents an object, with the keys corresponding to\n+the attribute names of model objects.\n+\n+This example compares the dictionaries of ``values()`` with the normal model\n+objects::\n+\n+    # This list contains a Blog object.\n+    >>> Blog.objects.filter(name__startswith='Beatles')\n+    <QuerySet [<Blog: Beatles Blog>]>\n+\n+    # This list contains a dictionary.\n+    >>> Blog.objects.filter(name__startswith='Beatles').values()\n+    <QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Beatles Blog', 'tagline': 'All the latest Beatles news.'}]>\n+\n+The ``values()`` method takes optional positional arguments, ``*fields``, which\n+specify field names to which the ``SELECT`` should be limited. If you specify\n+the fields, each dictionary will contain only the field keys/values for the\n+fields you specify. If you don't specify the fields, each dictionary will\n+contain a key and value for every field in the database table.\n+\n+Example::\n+\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values()\n+    <QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Beatles Blog', 'tagline': 'All the latest Beatles news.'}]>\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values('id', 'name')\n+    <QuerySet [{'id': 1, 'name': 'Beatles Blog'}]>\n+\n+The ``values()`` method also takes optional keyword arguments,\n+``**expressions``, which are passed through to :meth:`annotate`::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models.functions import Lower\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values(lower_name=Lower('name'))\n+    <QuerySet [{'lower_name': 'beatles blog'}]>\n+\n+You can use built-in and :doc:`custom lookups </howto/custom-lookups>` in\n+ordering. For example::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import CharField\n+    >>> from django.db.models.functions import Lower\n+    >>> CharField.register_lookup(Lower)\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values('name__lower')\n+    <QuerySet [{'name__lower': 'beatles blog'}]>\n+\n+An aggregate within a ``values()`` clause is applied before other arguments\n+within the same ``values()`` clause. If you need to group by another value,\n+add it to an earlier ``values()`` clause instead. For example::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import Count\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values('entry__authors', entries=Count('entry'))\n+    <QuerySet [{'entry__authors': 1, 'entries': 20}, {'entry__authors': 1, 'entries': 13}]>\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values('entry__authors').annotate(entries=Count('entry'))\n+    <QuerySet [{'entry__authors': 1, 'entries': 33}]>\n+\n+A few subtleties that are worth mentioning:\n+\n+* If you have a field called ``foo`` that is a\n+  :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey`, the default ``values()`` call\n+  will return a dictionary key called ``foo_id``, since this is the name\n+  of the hidden model attribute that stores the actual value (the ``foo``\n+  attribute refers to the related model). When you are calling\n+  ``values()`` and passing in field names, you can pass in either ``foo``\n+  or ``foo_id`` and you will get back the same thing (the dictionary key\n+  will match the field name you passed in).\n+\n+  For example::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values()\n+    <QuerySet [{'blog_id': 1, 'headline': 'First Entry', ...}, ...]>\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values('blog')\n+    <QuerySet [{'blog': 1}, ...]>\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values('blog_id')\n+    <QuerySet [{'blog_id': 1}, ...]>\n+\n+* When using ``values()`` together with :meth:`distinct()`, be aware that\n+  ordering can affect the results. See the note in :meth:`distinct` for\n+  details.\n+\n+* If you use a ``values()`` clause after an :meth:`extra()` call,\n+  any fields defined by a ``select`` argument in the :meth:`extra()` must\n+  be explicitly included in the ``values()`` call. Any :meth:`extra()` call\n+  made after a ``values()`` call will have its extra selected fields\n+  ignored.\n+\n+* Calling :meth:`only()` and :meth:`defer()` after ``values()`` doesn't make\n+  sense, so doing so will raise a ``NotImplementedError``.\n+\n+* Combining transforms and aggregates requires the use of two :meth:`annotate`\n+  calls, either explicitly or as keyword arguments to :meth:`values`. As above,\n+  if the transform has been registered on the relevant field type the first\n+  :meth:`annotate` can be omitted, thus the following examples are equivalent::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import CharField, Count\n+    >>> from django.db.models.functions import Lower\n+    >>> CharField.register_lookup(Lower)\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values('entry__authors__name__lower').annotate(entries=Count('entry'))\n+    <QuerySet [{'entry__authors__name__lower': 'test author', 'entries': 33}]>\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values(\n+    ...     entry__authors__name__lower=Lower('entry__authors__name')\n+    ... ).annotate(entries=Count('entry'))\n+    <QuerySet [{'entry__authors__name__lower': 'test author', 'entries': 33}]>\n+    >>> Blog.objects.annotate(\n+    ...     entry__authors__name__lower=Lower('entry__authors__name')\n+    ... ).values('entry__authors__name__lower').annotate(entries=Count('entry'))\n+    <QuerySet [{'entry__authors__name__lower': 'test author', 'entries': 33}]>\n+\n+It is useful when you know you're only going to need values from a small number\n+of the available fields and you won't need the functionality of a model\n+instance object. It's more efficient to select only the fields you need to use.\n+\n+Finally, note that you can call ``filter()``, ``order_by()``, etc. after the\n+``values()`` call, that means that these two calls are identical::\n+\n+    Blog.objects.values().order_by('id')\n+    Blog.objects.order_by('id').values()\n+\n+The people who made Django prefer to put all the SQL-affecting methods first,\n+followed (optionally) by any output-affecting methods (such as ``values()``),\n+but it doesn't really matter. This is your chance to really flaunt your\n+individualism.\n+\n+You can also refer to fields on related models with reverse relations through\n+``OneToOneField``, ``ForeignKey`` and ``ManyToManyField`` attributes::\n+\n+    >>> Blog.objects.values('name', 'entry__headline')\n+    <QuerySet [{'name': 'My blog', 'entry__headline': 'An entry'},\n+         {'name': 'My blog', 'entry__headline': 'Another entry'}, ...]>\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+   Because :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField` attributes and reverse\n+   relations can have multiple related rows, including these can have a\n+   multiplier effect on the size of your result set. This will be especially\n+   pronounced if you include multiple such fields in your ``values()`` query,\n+   in which case all possible combinations will be returned.\n+\n+``values_list()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: values_list(*fields, flat=False, named=False)\n+\n+This is similar to ``values()`` except that instead of returning dictionaries,\n+it returns tuples when iterated over. Each tuple contains the value from the\n+respective field or expression passed into the ``values_list()`` call \u2014 so the\n+first item is the first field, etc. For example::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values_list('id', 'headline')\n+    <QuerySet [(1, 'First entry'), ...]>\n+    >>> from django.db.models.functions import Lower\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values_list('id', Lower('headline'))\n+    <QuerySet [(1, 'first entry'), ...]>\n+\n+If you only pass in a single field, you can also pass in the ``flat``\n+parameter. If ``True``, this will mean the returned results are single values,\n+rather than one-tuples. An example should make the difference clearer::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values_list('id').order_by('id')\n+    <QuerySet[(1,), (2,), (3,), ...]>\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values_list('id', flat=True).order_by('id')\n+    <QuerySet [1, 2, 3, ...]>\n+\n+It is an error to pass in ``flat`` when there is more than one field.\n+\n+You can pass ``named=True`` to get results as a\n+:func:`~python:collections.namedtuple`::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values_list('id', 'headline', named=True)\n+    <QuerySet [Row(id=1, headline='First entry'), ...]>\n+\n+Using a named tuple may make use of the results more readable, at the expense\n+of a small performance penalty for transforming the results into a named tuple.\n+\n+If you don't pass any values to ``values_list()``, it will return all the\n+fields in the model, in the order they were declared.\n+\n+A common need is to get a specific field value of a certain model instance. To\n+achieve that, use ``values_list()`` followed by a ``get()`` call::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values_list('headline', flat=True).get(pk=1)\n+    'First entry'\n+\n+``values()`` and ``values_list()`` are both intended as optimizations for a\n+specific use case: retrieving a subset of data without the overhead of creating\n+a model instance. This metaphor falls apart when dealing with many-to-many and\n+other multivalued relations (such as the one-to-many relation of a reverse\n+foreign key) because the \"one row, one object\" assumption doesn't hold.\n+\n+For example, notice the behavior when querying across a\n+:class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField`::\n+\n+    >>> Author.objects.values_list('name', 'entry__headline')\n+    <QuerySet [('Noam Chomsky', 'Impressions of Gaza'),\n+     ('George Orwell', 'Why Socialists Do Not Believe in Fun'),\n+     ('George Orwell', 'In Defence of English Cooking'),\n+     ('Don Quixote', None)]>\n+\n+Authors with multiple entries appear multiple times and authors without any\n+entries have ``None`` for the entry headline.\n+\n+Similarly, when querying a reverse foreign key, ``None`` appears for entries\n+not having any author::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.values_list('authors')\n+    <QuerySet [('Noam Chomsky',), ('George Orwell',), (None,)]>\n+\n+``dates()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: dates(field, kind, order='ASC')\n+\n+Returns a ``QuerySet`` that evaluates to a list of :class:`datetime.date`\n+objects representing all available dates of a particular kind within the\n+contents of the ``QuerySet``.\n+\n+``field`` should be the name of a ``DateField`` of your model.\n+``kind`` should be either ``\"year\"``, ``\"month\"``, ``\"week\"``, or ``\"day\"``.\n+Each :class:`datetime.date` object in the result list is \"truncated\" to the\n+given ``type``.\n+\n+* ``\"year\"`` returns a list of all distinct year values for the field.\n+* ``\"month\"`` returns a list of all distinct year/month values for the\n+  field.\n+* ``\"week\"`` returns a list of all distinct year/week values for the field. All\n+  dates will be a Monday.\n+* ``\"day\"`` returns a list of all distinct year/month/day values for the\n+  field.\n+\n+``order``, which defaults to ``'ASC'``, should be either ``'ASC'`` or\n+``'DESC'``. This specifies how to order the results.\n+\n+Examples::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.dates('pub_date', 'year')\n+    [datetime.date(2005, 1, 1)]\n+    >>> Entry.objects.dates('pub_date', 'month')\n+    [datetime.date(2005, 2, 1), datetime.date(2005, 3, 1)]\n+    >>> Entry.objects.dates('pub_date', 'week')\n+    [datetime.date(2005, 2, 14), datetime.date(2005, 3, 14)]\n+    >>> Entry.objects.dates('pub_date', 'day')\n+    [datetime.date(2005, 2, 20), datetime.date(2005, 3, 20)]\n+    >>> Entry.objects.dates('pub_date', 'day', order='DESC')\n+    [datetime.date(2005, 3, 20), datetime.date(2005, 2, 20)]\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(headline__contains='Lennon').dates('pub_date', 'day')\n+    [datetime.date(2005, 3, 20)]\n+\n+``datetimes()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: datetimes(field_name, kind, order='ASC', tzinfo=None)\n+\n+Returns a ``QuerySet`` that evaluates to a list of :class:`datetime.datetime`\n+objects representing all available dates of a particular kind within the\n+contents of the ``QuerySet``.\n+\n+``field_name`` should be the name of a ``DateTimeField`` of your model.\n+\n+``kind`` should be either ``\"year\"``, ``\"month\"``, ``\"week\"``, ``\"day\"``,\n+``\"hour\"``, ``\"minute\"``, or ``\"second\"``. Each :class:`datetime.datetime`\n+object in the result list is \"truncated\" to the given ``type``.\n+\n+``order``, which defaults to ``'ASC'``, should be either ``'ASC'`` or\n+``'DESC'``. This specifies how to order the results.\n+\n+``tzinfo`` defines the time zone to which datetimes are converted prior to\n+truncation. Indeed, a given datetime has different representations depending\n+on the time zone in use. This parameter must be a :class:`datetime.tzinfo`\n+object. If it's ``None``, Django uses the :ref:`current time zone\n+<default-current-time-zone>`. It has no effect when :setting:`USE_TZ` is\n+``False``.\n+\n+.. _database-time-zone-definitions:\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    This function performs time zone conversions directly in the database.\n+    As a consequence, your database must be able to interpret the value of\n+    ``tzinfo.tzname(None)``. This translates into the following requirements:\n+\n+    - SQLite: no requirements. Conversions are performed in Python with pytz_\n+      (installed when you install Django).\n+    - PostgreSQL: no requirements (see `Time Zones`_).\n+    - Oracle: no requirements (see `Choosing a Time Zone File`_).\n+    - MySQL: load the time zone tables with `mysql_tzinfo_to_sql`_.\n+\n+    .. _pytz: http://pytz.sourceforge.net/\n+    .. _Time Zones: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-datetime.html#DATATYPE-TIMEZONES\n+    .. _Choosing a Time Zone File: https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/\n+       oracle-database/18/nlspg/datetime-data-types-and-time-zone-support.html\n+       #GUID-805AB986-DE12-4FEA-AF56-5AABCD2132DF\n+    .. _mysql_tzinfo_to_sql: https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/en/mysql-tzinfo-to-sql.html\n+\n+``none()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: none()\n+\n+Calling none() will create a queryset that never returns any objects and no\n+query will be executed when accessing the results. A qs.none() queryset\n+is an instance of ``EmptyQuerySet``.\n+\n+Examples::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.none()\n+    <QuerySet []>\n+    >>> from django.db.models.query import EmptyQuerySet\n+    >>> isinstance(Entry.objects.none(), EmptyQuerySet)\n+    True\n+\n+``all()``\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: all()\n+\n+Returns a *copy* of the current ``QuerySet`` (or ``QuerySet`` subclass).  This\n+can be useful in situations where you might want to pass in either a model\n+manager or a ``QuerySet`` and do further filtering on the result. After calling\n+``all()`` on either object, you'll definitely have a ``QuerySet`` to work with.\n+\n+When a ``QuerySet`` is :ref:`evaluated <when-querysets-are-evaluated>`, it\n+typically caches its results. If the data in the database might have changed\n+since a ``QuerySet`` was evaluated, you can get updated results for the same\n+query by calling ``all()`` on a previously evaluated ``QuerySet``.\n+\n+``union()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: union(*other_qs, all=False)\n+\n+Uses SQL's ``UNION`` operator to combine the results of two or more\n+``QuerySet``\\s. For example:\n+\n+    >>> qs1.union(qs2, qs3)\n+\n+The ``UNION`` operator selects only distinct values by default. To allow\n+duplicate values, use the ``all=True`` argument.\n+\n+``union()``, ``intersection()``, and ``difference()`` return model instances\n+of the type of the first ``QuerySet`` even if the arguments are ``QuerySet``\\s\n+of other models. Passing different models works as long as the ``SELECT`` list\n+is the same in all ``QuerySet``\\s (at least the types, the names don't matter\n+as long as the types in the same order). In such cases, you must use the column\n+names from the first ``QuerySet`` in ``QuerySet`` methods applied to the\n+resulting ``QuerySet``. For example::\n+\n+    >>> qs1 = Author.objects.values_list('name')\n+    >>> qs2 = Entry.objects.values_list('headline')\n+    >>> qs1.union(qs2).order_by('name')\n+\n+In addition, only ``LIMIT``, ``OFFSET``, ``COUNT(*)``, ``ORDER BY``, and\n+specifying columns (i.e. slicing, :meth:`count`, :meth:`order_by`, and\n+:meth:`values()`/:meth:`values_list()`) are allowed on the resulting\n+``QuerySet``. Further, databases place restrictions on what operations are\n+allowed in the combined queries. For example, most databases don't allow\n+``LIMIT`` or ``OFFSET`` in the combined queries.\n+\n+``intersection()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: intersection(*other_qs)\n+\n+Uses SQL's ``INTERSECT`` operator to return the shared elements of two or more\n+``QuerySet``\\s. For example:\n+\n+    >>> qs1.intersection(qs2, qs3)\n+\n+See :meth:`union` for some restrictions.\n+\n+``difference()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: difference(*other_qs)\n+\n+Uses SQL's ``EXCEPT`` operator to keep only elements present in the\n+``QuerySet`` but not in some other ``QuerySet``\\s. For example::\n+\n+    >>> qs1.difference(qs2, qs3)\n+\n+See :meth:`union` for some restrictions.\n+\n+``select_related()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: select_related(*fields)\n+\n+Returns a ``QuerySet`` that will \"follow\" foreign-key relationships, selecting\n+additional related-object data when it executes its query. This is a\n+performance booster which results in a single more complex query but means\n+later use of foreign-key relationships won't require database queries.\n+\n+The following examples illustrate the difference between plain lookups and\n+``select_related()`` lookups. Here's standard lookup::\n+\n+    # Hits the database.\n+    e = Entry.objects.get(id=5)\n+\n+    # Hits the database again to get the related Blog object.\n+    b = e.blog\n+\n+And here's ``select_related`` lookup::\n+\n+    # Hits the database.\n+    e = Entry.objects.select_related('blog').get(id=5)\n+\n+    # Doesn't hit the database, because e.blog has been prepopulated\n+    # in the previous query.\n+    b = e.blog\n+\n+You can use ``select_related()`` with any queryset of objects::\n+\n+    from django.utils import timezone\n+\n+    # Find all the blogs with entries scheduled to be published in the future.\n+    blogs = set()\n+\n+    for e in Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__gt=timezone.now()).select_related('blog'):\n+        # Without select_related(), this would make a database query for each\n+        # loop iteration in order to fetch the related blog for each entry.\n+        blogs.add(e.blog)\n+\n+The order of ``filter()`` and ``select_related()`` chaining isn't important.\n+These querysets are equivalent::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__gt=timezone.now()).select_related('blog')\n+    Entry.objects.select_related('blog').filter(pub_date__gt=timezone.now())\n+\n+You can follow foreign keys in a similar way to querying them. If you have the\n+following models::\n+\n+    from django.db import models\n+\n+    class City(models.Model):\n+        # ...\n+        pass\n+\n+    class Person(models.Model):\n+        # ...\n+        hometown = models.ForeignKey(\n+            City,\n+            on_delete=models.SET_NULL,\n+            blank=True,\n+            null=True,\n+        )\n+\n+    class Book(models.Model):\n+        # ...\n+        author = models.ForeignKey(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n+\n+... then a call to ``Book.objects.select_related('author__hometown').get(id=4)``\n+will cache the related ``Person`` *and* the related ``City``::\n+\n+    # Hits the database with joins to the author and hometown tables.\n+    b = Book.objects.select_related('author__hometown').get(id=4)\n+    p = b.author         # Doesn't hit the database.\n+    c = p.hometown       # Doesn't hit the database.\n+\n+    # Without select_related()...\n+    b = Book.objects.get(id=4)  # Hits the database.\n+    p = b.author         # Hits the database.\n+    c = p.hometown       # Hits the database.\n+\n+You can refer to any :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey` or\n+:class:`~django.db.models.OneToOneField` relation in the list of fields\n+passed to ``select_related()``.\n+\n+You can also refer to the reverse direction of a\n+:class:`~django.db.models.OneToOneField` in the list of fields passed to\n+``select_related`` \u2014 that is, you can traverse a\n+:class:`~django.db.models.OneToOneField` back to the object on which the field\n+is defined. Instead of specifying the field name, use the :attr:`related_name\n+<django.db.models.ForeignKey.related_name>` for the field on the related object.\n+\n+There may be some situations where you wish to call ``select_related()`` with a\n+lot of related objects, or where you don't know all of the relations. In these\n+cases it is possible to call ``select_related()`` with no arguments. This will\n+follow all non-null foreign keys it can find - nullable foreign keys must be\n+specified. This is not recommended in most cases as it is likely to make the\n+underlying query more complex, and return more data, than is actually needed.\n+\n+If you need to clear the list of related fields added by past calls of\n+``select_related`` on a ``QuerySet``, you can pass ``None`` as a parameter::\n+\n+   >>> without_relations = queryset.select_related(None)\n+\n+Chaining ``select_related`` calls works in a similar way to other methods -\n+that is that ``select_related('foo', 'bar')`` is equivalent to\n+``select_related('foo').select_related('bar')``.\n+\n+``prefetch_related()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: prefetch_related(*lookups)\n+\n+Returns a ``QuerySet`` that will automatically retrieve, in a single batch,\n+related objects for each of the specified lookups.\n+\n+This has a similar purpose to ``select_related``, in that both are designed to\n+stop the deluge of database queries that is caused by accessing related objects,\n+but the strategy is quite different.\n+\n+``select_related`` works by creating an SQL join and including the fields of the\n+related object in the ``SELECT`` statement. For this reason, ``select_related``\n+gets the related objects in the same database query. However, to avoid the much\n+larger result set that would result from joining across a 'many' relationship,\n+``select_related`` is limited to single-valued relationships - foreign key and\n+one-to-one.\n+\n+``prefetch_related``, on the other hand, does a separate lookup for each\n+relationship, and does the 'joining' in Python. This allows it to prefetch\n+many-to-many and many-to-one objects, which cannot be done using\n+``select_related``, in addition to the foreign key and one-to-one relationships\n+that are supported by ``select_related``. It also supports prefetching of\n+:class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericRelation` and\n+:class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey`, however, it\n+must be restricted to a homogeneous set of results. For example, prefetching\n+objects referenced by a ``GenericForeignKey`` is only supported if the query\n+is restricted to one ``ContentType``.\n+\n+For example, suppose you have these models::\n+\n+    from django.db import models\n+\n+    class Topping(models.Model):\n+        name = models.CharField(max_length=30)\n+\n+    class Pizza(models.Model):\n+        name = models.CharField(max_length=50)\n+        toppings = models.ManyToManyField(Topping)\n+\n+        def __str__(self):\n+            return \"%s (%s)\" % (\n+                self.name,\n+                \", \".join(topping.name for topping in self.toppings.all()),\n+            )\n+\n+and run::\n+\n+    >>> Pizza.objects.all()\n+    [\"Hawaiian (ham, pineapple)\", \"Seafood (prawns, smoked salmon)\"...\n+\n+The problem with this is that every time ``Pizza.__str__()`` asks for\n+``self.toppings.all()`` it has to query the database, so\n+``Pizza.objects.all()`` will run a query on the Toppings table for **every**\n+item in the Pizza ``QuerySet``.\n+\n+We can reduce to just two queries using ``prefetch_related``:\n+\n+    >>> Pizza.objects.all().prefetch_related('toppings')\n+\n+This implies a ``self.toppings.all()`` for each ``Pizza``; now each time\n+``self.toppings.all()`` is called, instead of having to go to the database for\n+the items, it will find them in a prefetched ``QuerySet`` cache that was\n+populated in a single query.\n+\n+That is, all the relevant toppings will have been fetched in a single query,\n+and used to make ``QuerySets`` that have a pre-filled cache of the relevant\n+results; these ``QuerySets`` are then used in the ``self.toppings.all()`` calls.\n+\n+The additional queries in ``prefetch_related()`` are executed after the\n+``QuerySet`` has begun to be evaluated and the primary query has been executed.\n+\n+If you have an iterable of model instances, you can prefetch related attributes\n+on those instances using the :func:`~django.db.models.prefetch_related_objects`\n+function.\n+\n+Note that the result cache of the primary ``QuerySet`` and all specified related\n+objects will then be fully loaded into memory. This changes the typical\n+behavior of ``QuerySets``, which normally try to avoid loading all objects into\n+memory before they are needed, even after a query has been executed in the\n+database.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    Remember that, as always with ``QuerySets``, any subsequent chained methods\n+    which imply a different database query will ignore previously cached\n+    results, and retrieve data using a fresh database query. So, if you write\n+    the following:\n+\n+        >>> pizzas = Pizza.objects.prefetch_related('toppings')\n+        >>> [list(pizza.toppings.filter(spicy=True)) for pizza in pizzas]\n+\n+    ...then the fact that ``pizza.toppings.all()`` has been prefetched will not\n+    help you. The ``prefetch_related('toppings')`` implied\n+    ``pizza.toppings.all()``, but ``pizza.toppings.filter()`` is a new and\n+    different query. The prefetched cache can't help here; in fact it hurts\n+    performance, since you have done a database query that you haven't used. So\n+    use this feature with caution!\n+\n+    Also, if you call the database-altering methods\n+    :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.add`,\n+    :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.remove`,\n+    :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.clear` or\n+    :meth:`~django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager.set`, on\n+    :class:`related managers<django.db.models.fields.related.RelatedManager>`,\n+    any prefetched cache for the relation will be cleared.\n+\n+You can also use the normal join syntax to do related fields of related\n+fields. Suppose we have an additional model to the example above::\n+\n+    class Restaurant(models.Model):\n+        pizzas = models.ManyToManyField(Pizza, related_name='restaurants')\n+        best_pizza = models.ForeignKey(Pizza, related_name='championed_by', on_delete=models.CASCADE)\n+\n+The following are all legal:\n+\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related('pizzas__toppings')\n+\n+This will prefetch all pizzas belonging to restaurants, and all toppings\n+belonging to those pizzas. This will result in a total of 3 database queries -\n+one for the restaurants, one for the pizzas, and one for the toppings.\n+\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related('best_pizza__toppings')\n+\n+This will fetch the best pizza and all the toppings for the best pizza for each\n+restaurant. This will be done in 3 database queries - one for the restaurants,\n+one for the 'best pizzas', and one for the toppings.\n+\n+Of course, the ``best_pizza`` relationship could also be fetched using\n+``select_related`` to reduce the query count to 2:\n+\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.select_related('best_pizza').prefetch_related('best_pizza__toppings')\n+\n+Since the prefetch is executed after the main query (which includes the joins\n+needed by ``select_related``), it is able to detect that the ``best_pizza``\n+objects have already been fetched, and it will skip fetching them again.\n+\n+Chaining ``prefetch_related`` calls will accumulate the lookups that are\n+prefetched. To clear any ``prefetch_related`` behavior, pass ``None`` as a\n+parameter:\n+\n+   >>> non_prefetched = qs.prefetch_related(None)\n+\n+One difference to note when using ``prefetch_related`` is that objects created\n+by a query can be shared between the different objects that they are related to\n+i.e. a single Python model instance can appear at more than one point in the\n+tree of objects that are returned. This will normally happen with foreign key\n+relationships. Typically this behavior will not be a problem, and will in fact\n+save both memory and CPU time.\n+\n+While ``prefetch_related`` supports prefetching ``GenericForeignKey``\n+relationships, the number of queries will depend on the data. Since a\n+``GenericForeignKey`` can reference data in multiple tables, one query per table\n+referenced is needed, rather than one query for all the items. There could be\n+additional queries on the ``ContentType`` table if the relevant rows have not\n+already been fetched.\n+\n+``prefetch_related`` in most cases will be implemented using an SQL query that\n+uses the 'IN' operator. This means that for a large ``QuerySet`` a large 'IN' clause\n+could be generated, which, depending on the database, might have performance\n+problems of its own when it comes to parsing or executing the SQL query. Always\n+profile for your use case!\n+\n+Note that if you use ``iterator()`` to run the query, ``prefetch_related()``\n+calls will be ignored since these two optimizations do not make sense together.\n+\n+You can use the :class:`~django.db.models.Prefetch` object to further control\n+the prefetch operation.\n+\n+In its simplest form ``Prefetch`` is equivalent to the traditional string based\n+lookups:\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import Prefetch\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related(Prefetch('pizzas__toppings'))\n+\n+You can provide a custom queryset with the optional ``queryset`` argument.\n+This can be used to change the default ordering of the queryset:\n+\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related(\n+    ...     Prefetch('pizzas__toppings', queryset=Toppings.objects.order_by('name')))\n+\n+Or to call :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related()` when\n+applicable to reduce the number of queries even further:\n+\n+    >>> Pizza.objects.prefetch_related(\n+    ...     Prefetch('restaurants', queryset=Restaurant.objects.select_related('best_pizza')))\n+\n+You can also assign the prefetched result to a custom attribute with the optional\n+``to_attr`` argument. The result will be stored directly in a list.\n+\n+This allows prefetching the same relation multiple times with a different\n+``QuerySet``; for instance:\n+\n+    >>> vegetarian_pizzas = Pizza.objects.filter(vegetarian=True)\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related(\n+    ...     Prefetch('pizzas', to_attr='menu'),\n+    ...     Prefetch('pizzas', queryset=vegetarian_pizzas, to_attr='vegetarian_menu'))\n+\n+Lookups created with custom ``to_attr`` can still be traversed as usual by other\n+lookups:\n+\n+    >>> vegetarian_pizzas = Pizza.objects.filter(vegetarian=True)\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related(\n+    ...     Prefetch('pizzas', queryset=vegetarian_pizzas, to_attr='vegetarian_menu'),\n+    ...     'vegetarian_menu__toppings')\n+\n+Using ``to_attr`` is recommended when filtering down the prefetch result as it is\n+less ambiguous than storing a filtered result in the related manager's cache:\n+\n+    >>> queryset = Pizza.objects.filter(vegetarian=True)\n+    >>>\n+    >>> # Recommended:\n+    >>> restaurants = Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related(\n+    ...     Prefetch('pizzas', queryset=queryset, to_attr='vegetarian_pizzas'))\n+    >>> vegetarian_pizzas = restaurants[0].vegetarian_pizzas\n+    >>>\n+    >>> # Not recommended:\n+    >>> restaurants = Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related(\n+    ...     Prefetch('pizzas', queryset=queryset))\n+    >>> vegetarian_pizzas = restaurants[0].pizzas.all()\n+\n+Custom prefetching also works with single related relations like\n+forward ``ForeignKey`` or ``OneToOneField``. Generally you'll want to use\n+:meth:`select_related()` for these relations, but there are a number of cases\n+where prefetching with a custom ``QuerySet`` is useful:\n+\n+* You want to use a ``QuerySet`` that performs further prefetching\n+  on related models.\n+\n+* You want to prefetch only a subset of the related objects.\n+\n+* You want to use performance optimization techniques like\n+  :meth:`deferred fields <defer()>`:\n+\n+    >>> queryset = Pizza.objects.only('name')\n+    >>>\n+    >>> restaurants = Restaurant.objects.prefetch_related(\n+    ...     Prefetch('best_pizza', queryset=queryset))\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The ordering of lookups matters.\n+\n+    Take the following examples:\n+\n+       >>> prefetch_related('pizzas__toppings', 'pizzas')\n+\n+    This works even though it's unordered because ``'pizzas__toppings'``\n+    already contains all the needed information, therefore the second argument\n+    ``'pizzas'`` is actually redundant.\n+\n+        >>> prefetch_related('pizzas__toppings', Prefetch('pizzas', queryset=Pizza.objects.all()))\n+\n+    This will raise a ``ValueError`` because of the attempt to redefine the\n+    queryset of a previously seen lookup. Note that an implicit queryset was\n+    created to traverse ``'pizzas'`` as part of the ``'pizzas__toppings'``\n+    lookup.\n+\n+        >>> prefetch_related('pizza_list__toppings', Prefetch('pizzas', to_attr='pizza_list'))\n+\n+    This will trigger an ``AttributeError`` because ``'pizza_list'`` doesn't exist yet\n+    when ``'pizza_list__toppings'`` is being processed.\n+\n+    This consideration is not limited to the use of ``Prefetch`` objects. Some\n+    advanced techniques may require that the lookups be performed in a\n+    specific order to avoid creating extra queries; therefore it's recommended\n+    to always carefully order ``prefetch_related`` arguments.\n+\n+``extra()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: extra(select=None, where=None, params=None, tables=None, order_by=None, select_params=None)\n+\n+Sometimes, the Django query syntax by itself can't easily express a complex\n+``WHERE`` clause. For these edge cases, Django provides the ``extra()``\n+``QuerySet`` modifier \u2014 a hook for injecting specific clauses into the SQL\n+generated by a ``QuerySet``.\n+\n+.. admonition:: Use this method as a last resort\n+\n+    This is an old API that we aim to deprecate at some point in the future.\n+    Use it only if you cannot express your query using other queryset methods.\n+    If you do need to use it, please `file a ticket\n+    <https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket>`_ using the `QuerySet.extra\n+    keyword <https://code.djangoproject.com/query?status=assigned&status=new&keywords=~QuerySet.extra>`_\n+    with your use case (please check the list of existing tickets first) so\n+    that we can enhance the QuerySet API to allow removing ``extra()``. We are\n+    no longer improving or fixing bugs for this method.\n+\n+    For example, this use of ``extra()``::\n+\n+        >>> qs.extra(\n+        ...     select={'val': \"select col from sometable where othercol = %s\"},\n+        ...     select_params=(someparam,),\n+        ... )\n+\n+    is equivalent to::\n+\n+        >>> qs.annotate(val=RawSQL(\"select col from sometable where othercol = %s\", (someparam,)))\n+\n+    The main benefit of using :class:`~django.db.models.expressions.RawSQL` is\n+    that you can set ``output_field`` if needed. The main downside is that if\n+    you refer to some table alias of the queryset in the raw SQL, then it is\n+    possible that Django might change that alias (for example, when the\n+    queryset is used as a subquery in yet another query).\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    You should be very careful whenever you use ``extra()``. Every time you use\n+    it, you should escape any parameters that the user can control by using\n+    ``params`` in order to protect against SQL injection attacks.\n+\n+    You also must not quote placeholders in the SQL string. This example is\n+    vulnerable to SQL injection because of the quotes around ``%s``:\n+\n+    .. code-block:: sql\n+\n+        SELECT col FROM sometable WHERE othercol = '%s'  # unsafe!\n+\n+    You can read more about how Django's :ref:`SQL injection protection\n+    <sql-injection-protection>` works.\n+\n+By definition, these extra lookups may not be portable to different database\n+engines (because you're explicitly writing SQL code) and violate the DRY\n+principle, so you should avoid them if possible.\n+\n+Specify one or more of ``params``, ``select``, ``where`` or ``tables``. None\n+of the arguments is required, but you should use at least one of them.\n+\n+* ``select``\n+\n+  The ``select`` argument lets you put extra fields in the ``SELECT``\n+  clause.  It should be a dictionary mapping attribute names to SQL\n+  clauses to use to calculate that attribute.\n+\n+  Example::\n+\n+      Entry.objects.extra(select={'is_recent': \"pub_date > '2006-01-01'\"})\n+\n+  As a result, each ``Entry`` object will have an extra attribute,\n+  ``is_recent``, a boolean representing whether the entry's ``pub_date``\n+  is greater than Jan. 1, 2006.\n+\n+  Django inserts the given SQL snippet directly into the ``SELECT``\n+  statement, so the resulting SQL of the above example would be something like:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: sql\n+\n+      SELECT blog_entry.*, (pub_date > '2006-01-01') AS is_recent\n+      FROM blog_entry;\n+\n+\n+  The next example is more advanced; it does a subquery to give each\n+  resulting ``Blog`` object an ``entry_count`` attribute, an integer count\n+  of associated ``Entry`` objects::\n+\n+      Blog.objects.extra(\n+          select={\n+              'entry_count': 'SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_entry WHERE blog_entry.blog_id = blog_blog.id'\n+          },\n+      )\n+\n+  In this particular case, we're exploiting the fact that the query will\n+  already contain the ``blog_blog`` table in its ``FROM`` clause.\n+\n+  The resulting SQL of the above example would be:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: sql\n+\n+      SELECT blog_blog.*, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM blog_entry WHERE blog_entry.blog_id = blog_blog.id) AS entry_count\n+      FROM blog_blog;\n+\n+  Note that the parentheses required by most database engines around\n+  subqueries are not required in Django's ``select`` clauses. Also note\n+  that some database backends, such as some MySQL versions, don't support\n+  subqueries.\n+\n+  In some rare cases, you might wish to pass parameters to the SQL\n+  fragments in ``extra(select=...)``. For this purpose, use the\n+  ``select_params`` parameter.\n+\n+  This will work, for example::\n+\n+      Blog.objects.extra(\n+          select={'a': '%s', 'b': '%s'},\n+          select_params=('one', 'two'),\n+      )\n+\n+  If you need to use a literal ``%s`` inside your select string, use\n+  the sequence ``%%s``.\n+\n+* ``where`` / ``tables``\n+\n+  You can define explicit SQL ``WHERE`` clauses \u2014 perhaps to perform\n+  non-explicit joins \u2014 by using ``where``. You can manually add tables to\n+  the SQL ``FROM`` clause by using ``tables``.\n+\n+  ``where`` and ``tables`` both take a list of strings. All ``where``\n+  parameters are \"AND\"ed to any other search criteria.\n+\n+  Example::\n+\n+      Entry.objects.extra(where=[\"foo='a' OR bar = 'a'\", \"baz = 'a'\"])\n+\n+  ...translates (roughly) into the following SQL:\n+\n+  .. code-block:: sql\n+\n+      SELECT * FROM blog_entry WHERE (foo='a' OR bar='a') AND (baz='a')\n+\n+  Be careful when using the ``tables`` parameter if you're specifying\n+  tables that are already used in the query. When you add extra tables\n+  via the ``tables`` parameter, Django assumes you want that table\n+  included an extra time, if it is already included. That creates a\n+  problem, since the table name will then be given an alias. If a table\n+  appears multiple times in an SQL statement, the second and subsequent\n+  occurrences must use aliases so the database can tell them apart. If\n+  you're referring to the extra table you added in the extra ``where``\n+  parameter this is going to cause errors.\n+\n+  Normally you'll only be adding extra tables that don't already appear\n+  in the query. However, if the case outlined above does occur, there are\n+  a few solutions. First, see if you can get by without including the\n+  extra table and use the one already in the query. If that isn't\n+  possible, put your ``extra()`` call at the front of the queryset\n+  construction so that your table is the first use of that table.\n+  Finally, if all else fails, look at the query produced and rewrite your\n+  ``where`` addition to use the alias given to your extra table. The\n+  alias will be the same each time you construct the queryset in the same\n+  way, so you can rely upon the alias name to not change.\n+\n+* ``order_by``\n+\n+  If you need to order the resulting queryset using some of the new\n+  fields or tables you have included via ``extra()`` use the ``order_by``\n+  parameter to ``extra()`` and pass in a sequence of strings. These\n+  strings should either be model fields (as in the normal\n+  :meth:`order_by()` method on querysets), of the form\n+  ``table_name.column_name`` or an alias for a column that you specified\n+  in the ``select`` parameter to ``extra()``.\n+\n+  For example::\n+\n+      q = Entry.objects.extra(select={'is_recent': \"pub_date > '2006-01-01'\"})\n+      q = q.extra(order_by = ['-is_recent'])\n+\n+  This would sort all the items for which ``is_recent`` is true to the\n+  front of the result set (``True`` sorts before ``False`` in a\n+  descending ordering).\n+\n+  This shows, by the way, that you can make multiple calls to ``extra()``\n+  and it will behave as you expect (adding new constraints each time).\n+\n+* ``params``\n+\n+  The ``where`` parameter described above may use standard Python\n+  database string placeholders \u2014 ``'%s'`` to indicate parameters the\n+  database engine should automatically quote. The ``params`` argument is\n+  a list of any extra parameters to be substituted.\n+\n+  Example::\n+\n+      Entry.objects.extra(where=['headline=%s'], params=['Lennon'])\n+\n+  Always use ``params`` instead of embedding values directly into\n+  ``where`` because ``params`` will ensure values are quoted correctly\n+  according to your particular backend. For example, quotes will be\n+  escaped correctly.\n+\n+  Bad::\n+\n+      Entry.objects.extra(where=[\"headline='Lennon'\"])\n+\n+  Good::\n+\n+      Entry.objects.extra(where=['headline=%s'], params=['Lennon'])\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    If you are performing queries on MySQL, note that MySQL's silent type coercion\n+    may cause unexpected results when mixing types. If you query on a string\n+    type column, but with an integer value, MySQL will coerce the types of all values\n+    in the table to an integer before performing the comparison. For example, if your\n+    table contains the values ``'abc'``, ``'def'`` and you query for ``WHERE mycolumn=0``,\n+    both rows will match. To prevent this, perform the correct typecasting\n+    before using the value in a query.\n+\n+``defer()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: defer(*fields)\n+\n+In some complex data-modeling situations, your models might contain a lot of\n+fields, some of which could contain a lot of data (for example, text fields),\n+or require expensive processing to convert them to Python objects. If you are\n+using the results of a queryset in some situation where you don't know\n+if you need those particular fields when you initially fetch the data, you can\n+tell Django not to retrieve them from the database.\n+\n+This is done by passing the names of the fields to not load to ``defer()``::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.defer(\"headline\", \"body\")\n+\n+A queryset that has deferred fields will still return model instances. Each\n+deferred field will be retrieved from the database if you access that field\n+(one at a time, not all the deferred fields at once).\n+\n+You can make multiple calls to ``defer()``. Each call adds new fields to the\n+deferred set::\n+\n+    # Defers both the body and headline fields.\n+    Entry.objects.defer(\"body\").filter(rating=5).defer(\"headline\")\n+\n+The order in which fields are added to the deferred set does not matter.\n+Calling ``defer()`` with a field name that has already been deferred is\n+harmless (the field will still be deferred).\n+\n+You can defer loading of fields in related models (if the related models are\n+loading via :meth:`select_related()`) by using the standard double-underscore\n+notation to separate related fields::\n+\n+    Blog.objects.select_related().defer(\"entry__headline\", \"entry__body\")\n+\n+If you want to clear the set of deferred fields, pass ``None`` as a parameter\n+to ``defer()``::\n+\n+    # Load all fields immediately.\n+    my_queryset.defer(None)\n+\n+Some fields in a model won't be deferred, even if you ask for them. You can\n+never defer the loading of the primary key. If you are using\n+:meth:`select_related()` to retrieve related models, you shouldn't defer the\n+loading of the field that connects from the primary model to the related\n+one, doing so will result in an error.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    The ``defer()`` method (and its cousin, :meth:`only()`, below) are only for\n+    advanced use-cases. They provide an optimization for when you have analyzed\n+    your queries closely and understand *exactly* what information you need and\n+    have measured that the difference between returning the fields you need and\n+    the full set of fields for the model will be significant.\n+\n+    Even if you think you are in the advanced use-case situation, **only use\n+    defer() when you cannot, at queryset load time, determine if you will need\n+    the extra fields or not**. If you are frequently loading and using a\n+    particular subset of your data, the best choice you can make is to\n+    normalize your models and put the non-loaded data into a separate model\n+    (and database table). If the columns *must* stay in the one table for some\n+    reason, create a model with ``Meta.managed = False`` (see the\n+    :attr:`managed attribute <django.db.models.Options.managed>` documentation)\n+    containing just the fields you normally need to load and use that where you\n+    might otherwise call ``defer()``. This makes your code more explicit to the\n+    reader, is slightly faster and consumes a little less memory in the Python\n+    process.\n+\n+    For example, both of these models use the same underlying database table::\n+\n+        class CommonlyUsedModel(models.Model):\n+            f1 = models.CharField(max_length=10)\n+\n+            class Meta:\n+                managed = False\n+                db_table = 'app_largetable'\n+\n+        class ManagedModel(models.Model):\n+            f1 = models.CharField(max_length=10)\n+            f2 = models.CharField(max_length=10)\n+\n+            class Meta:\n+                db_table = 'app_largetable'\n+\n+        # Two equivalent QuerySets:\n+        CommonlyUsedModel.objects.all()\n+        ManagedModel.objects.all().defer('f2')\n+\n+    If many fields need to be duplicated in the unmanaged model, it may be best\n+    to create an abstract model with the shared fields and then have the\n+    unmanaged and managed models inherit from the abstract model.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    When calling :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save()` for instances with\n+    deferred fields, only the loaded fields will be saved. See\n+    :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save()` for more details.\n+\n+``only()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: only(*fields)\n+\n+The ``only()`` method is more or less the opposite of :meth:`defer()`. You call\n+it with the fields that should *not* be deferred when retrieving a model.  If\n+you have a model where almost all the fields need to be deferred, using\n+``only()`` to specify the complementary set of fields can result in simpler\n+code.\n+\n+Suppose you have a model with fields ``name``, ``age`` and ``biography``. The\n+following two querysets are the same, in terms of deferred fields::\n+\n+    Person.objects.defer(\"age\", \"biography\")\n+    Person.objects.only(\"name\")\n+\n+Whenever you call ``only()`` it *replaces* the set of fields to load\n+immediately. The method's name is mnemonic: **only** those fields are loaded\n+immediately; the remainder are deferred. Thus, successive calls to ``only()``\n+result in only the final fields being considered::\n+\n+    # This will defer all fields except the headline.\n+    Entry.objects.only(\"body\", \"rating\").only(\"headline\")\n+\n+Since ``defer()`` acts incrementally (adding fields to the deferred list), you\n+can combine calls to ``only()`` and ``defer()`` and things will behave\n+logically::\n+\n+    # Final result is that everything except \"headline\" is deferred.\n+    Entry.objects.only(\"headline\", \"body\").defer(\"body\")\n+\n+    # Final result loads headline and body immediately (only() replaces any\n+    # existing set of fields).\n+    Entry.objects.defer(\"body\").only(\"headline\", \"body\")\n+\n+All of the cautions in the note for the :meth:`defer` documentation apply to\n+``only()`` as well. Use it cautiously and only after exhausting your other\n+options.\n+\n+Using :meth:`only` and omitting a field requested using :meth:`select_related`\n+is an error as well.\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    When calling :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save()` for instances with\n+    deferred fields, only the loaded fields will be saved. See\n+    :meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save()` for more details.\n+\n+``using()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: using(alias)\n+\n+This method is for controlling which database the ``QuerySet`` will be\n+evaluated against if you are using more than one database.  The only argument\n+this method takes is the alias of a database, as defined in\n+:setting:`DATABASES`.\n+\n+For example::\n+\n+    # queries the database with the 'default' alias.\n+    >>> Entry.objects.all()\n+\n+    # queries the database with the 'backup' alias\n+    >>> Entry.objects.using('backup')\n+\n+``select_for_update()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: select_for_update(nowait=False, skip_locked=False, of=())\n+\n+Returns a queryset that will lock rows until the end of the transaction,\n+generating a ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` SQL statement on supported databases.\n+\n+For example::\n+\n+    from django.db import transaction\n+\n+    entries = Entry.objects.select_for_update().filter(author=request.user)\n+    with transaction.atomic():\n+        for entry in entries:\n+            ...\n+\n+When the queryset is evaluated (``for entry in entries`` in this case), all\n+matched entries will be locked until the end of the transaction block, meaning\n+that other transactions will be prevented from changing or acquiring locks on\n+them.\n+\n+Usually, if another transaction has already acquired a lock on one of the\n+selected rows, the query will block until the lock is released. If this is\n+not the behavior you want, call ``select_for_update(nowait=True)``. This will\n+make the call non-blocking. If a conflicting lock is already acquired by\n+another transaction, :exc:`~django.db.DatabaseError` will be raised when the\n+queryset is evaluated. You can also ignore locked rows by using\n+``select_for_update(skip_locked=True)`` instead. The ``nowait`` and\n+``skip_locked`` are mutually exclusive and attempts to call\n+``select_for_update()`` with both options enabled will result in a\n+:exc:`ValueError`.\n+\n+By default, ``select_for_update()`` locks all rows that are selected by the\n+query. For example, rows of related objects specified in :meth:`select_related`\n+are locked in addition to rows of the queryset's model. If this isn't desired,\n+specify the related objects you want to lock in ``select_for_update(of=(...))``\n+using the same fields syntax as :meth:`select_related`. Use the value ``'self'``\n+to refer to the queryset's model.\n+\n+You can't use ``select_for_update()`` on nullable relations::\n+\n+    >>> Person.objects.select_related('hometown').select_for_update()\n+    Traceback (most recent call last):\n+    ...\n+    django.db.utils.NotSupportedError: FOR UPDATE cannot be applied to the nullable side of an outer join\n+\n+To avoid that restriction, you can exclude null objects if you don't care about\n+them::\n+\n+    >>> Person.objects.select_related('hometown').select_for_update().exclude(hometown=None)\n+    <QuerySet [<Person: ...)>, ...]>\n+\n+Currently, the ``postgresql``, ``oracle``, and ``mysql`` database\n+backends support ``select_for_update()``. However, MySQL doesn't support the\n+``nowait``, ``skip_locked``, and ``of`` arguments.\n+\n+Passing ``nowait=True``, ``skip_locked=True``, or ``of`` to\n+``select_for_update()`` using database backends that do not support these\n+options, such as MySQL, raises a :exc:`~django.db.NotSupportedError`. This\n+prevents code from unexpectedly blocking.\n+\n+Evaluating a queryset with ``select_for_update()`` in autocommit mode on\n+backends which support ``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` is a\n+:exc:`~django.db.transaction.TransactionManagementError` error because the\n+rows are not locked in that case. If allowed, this would facilitate data\n+corruption and could easily be caused by calling code that expects to be run in\n+a transaction outside of one.\n+\n+Using ``select_for_update()`` on backends which do not support\n+``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` (such as SQLite) will have no effect.\n+``SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`` will not be added to the query, and an error isn't\n+raised if ``select_for_update()`` is used in autocommit mode.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    Although ``select_for_update()`` normally fails in autocommit mode, since\n+    :class:`~django.test.TestCase` automatically wraps each test in a\n+    transaction, calling ``select_for_update()`` in a ``TestCase`` even outside\n+    an :func:`~django.db.transaction.atomic()` block will (perhaps unexpectedly)\n+    pass without raising a ``TransactionManagementError``. To properly test\n+    ``select_for_update()`` you should use\n+    :class:`~django.test.TransactionTestCase`.\n+\n+.. admonition:: Certain expressions may not be supported\n+\n+    PostgreSQL doesn't support ``select_for_update()`` with\n+    :class:`~django.db.models.expressions.Window` expressions.\n+\n+``raw()``\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: raw(raw_query, params=None, translations=None)\n+\n+Takes a raw SQL query, executes it, and returns a\n+``django.db.models.query.RawQuerySet`` instance. This ``RawQuerySet`` instance\n+can be iterated over just like a normal ``QuerySet`` to provide object\n+instances.\n+\n+See the :doc:`/topics/db/sql` for more information.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+  ``raw()`` always triggers a new query and doesn't account for previous\n+  filtering.

Rather,\n+they query the database each time they're called.\n+\n+``get()``\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: get(**kwargs)\n+\n+Returns the object matching the given lookup parameters, which should be in\n+the format described in `Field lookups`_.\n+\n+``get()`` raises :exc:`~django.core.exceptions.MultipleObjectsReturned` if more\n+than one object was found. The\n+:exc:`~django.core.exceptions.MultipleObjectsReturned` exception is an\n+attribute of the model class.\n+\n+``get()`` raises a :exc:`~django.db.models.Model.DoesNotExist` exception if an\n+object wasn't found for the given parameters. This exception is an attribute\n+of the model class. Example::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.get(id='foo') # raises Entry.DoesNotExist\n+\n+The :exc:`~django.db.models.Model.DoesNotExist` exception inherits from\n+:exc:`django.core.exceptions.ObjectDoesNotExist`, so you can target multiple\n+:exc:`~django.db.models.Model.DoesNotExist` exceptions. Example::\n+\n+    from django.core.exceptions import ObjectDoesNotExist\n+    try:\n+        e = Entry.objects.get(id=3)\n+        b = Blog.objects.get(id=1)\n+    except ObjectDoesNotExist:\n+        print(\"Either the entry or blog doesn't exist.\")\n+\n+If you expect a queryset to return one row, you can use ``get()`` without any\n+arguments to return the object for that row::\n+\n+    entry = Entry.objects.filter(...).exclude(...).get()\n+\n+``create()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: create(**kwargs)\n+\n+A convenience method for creating an object and saving it all in one step.  Thus::\n+\n+    p = Person.objects.create(first_name=\"Bruce\", last_name=\"Springsteen\")\n+\n+and::\n+\n+    p = Person(first_name=\"Bruce\", last_name=\"Springsteen\")\n+    p.save(force_insert=True)\n+\n+are equivalent.\n+\n+The :ref:`force_insert <ref-models-force-insert>` parameter is documented\n+elsewhere, but all it means is that a new object will always be created.\n+Normally you won't need to worry about this. However, if your model contains a\n+manual primary key value that you set and if that value already exists in the\n+database, a call to ``create()`` will fail with an\n+:exc:`~django.db.IntegrityError` since primary keys must be unique. Be\n+prepared to handle the exception if you are using manual primary keys.\n+\n+``get_or_create()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: get_or_create(defaults=None, **kwargs)\n+\n+A convenience method for looking up an object with the given ``kwargs`` (may be\n+empty if your model has defaults for all fields), creating one if necessary.\n+\n+Returns a tuple of ``(object, created)``, where ``object`` is the retrieved or\n+created object and ``created`` is a boolean specifying whether a new object was\n+created.\n+\n+This is meant to prevent duplicate objects from being created when requests are\n+made in parallel, and as a shortcut to boilerplatish code. For example::\n+\n+    try:\n+        obj = Person.objects.get(first_name='John', last_name='Lennon')\n+    except Person.DoesNotExist:\n+        obj = Person(first_name='John', last_name='Lennon', birthday=date(1940, 10, 9))\n+        obj.save()\n+\n+Here, with concurrent requests, multiple attempts to save a ``Person`` with\n+the same parameters may be made. To avoid this race condition, the above\n+example can be rewritten using ``get_or_create()`` like so::\n+\n+    obj, created = Person.objects.get_or_create(\n+        first_name='John',\n+        last_name='Lennon',\n+        defaults={'birthday': date(1940, 10, 9)},\n+    )\n+\n+Any keyword arguments passed to ``get_or_create()`` \u2014 *except* an optional one\n+called ``defaults`` \u2014 will be used in a :meth:`get()` call. If an object is\n+found, ``get_or_create()`` returns a tuple of that object and ``False``.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+    This method is atomic assuming that the database enforces uniqueness of the\n+    keyword arguments (see :attr:`~django.db.models.Field.unique` or\n+    :attr:`~django.db.models.Options.unique_together`). If the fields used in the\n+    keyword arguments do not have a uniqueness constraint, concurrent calls to\n+    this method may result in multiple rows with the same parameters being\n+    inserted.\n+\n+You can specify more complex conditions for the retrieved object by chaining\n+``get_or_create()`` with ``filter()`` and using :class:`Q objects\n+<django.db.models.Q>`. For example, to retrieve Robert or Bob Marley if either\n+exists, and create the latter otherwise::\n+\n+    from django.db.models import Q\n+\n+    obj, created = Person.objects.filter(\n+        Q(first_name='Bob') | Q(first_name='Robert'),\n+    ).get_or_create(last_name='Marley', defaults={'first_name': 'Bob'})\n+\n+If multiple objects are found, ``get_or_create()`` raises\n+:exc:`~django.core.exceptions.MultipleObjectsReturned`. If an object is *not*\n+found, ``get_or_create()`` will instantiate and save a new object, returning a\n+tuple of the new object and ``True``. The new object will be created roughly\n+according to this algorithm::\n+\n+    params = {k: v for k, v in kwargs.items() if '__' not in k}\n+    params.update({k: v() if callable(v) else v for k, v in defaults.items()})\n+    obj = self.model(**params)\n+    obj.save()\n+\n+In English, that means start with any non-``'defaults'`` keyword argument that\n+doesn't contain a double underscore (which would indicate a non-exact lookup).\n+Then add the contents of ``defaults``, overriding any keys if necessary, and\n+use the result as the keyword arguments to the model class. If there are any\n+callables in ``defaults``, evaluate them. As hinted at above, this is a\n+simplification of the algorithm that is used, but it contains all the pertinent\n+details. The internal implementation has some more error-checking than this and\n+handles some extra edge-conditions; if you're interested, read the code.\n+\n+If you have a field named ``defaults`` and want to use it as an exact lookup in\n+``get_or_create()``, use ``'defaults__exact'``, like so::\n+\n+    Foo.objects.get_or_create(defaults__exact='bar', defaults={'defaults': 'baz'})\n+\n+The ``get_or_create()`` method has similar error behavior to :meth:`create()`\n+when you're using manually specified primary keys. If an object needs to be\n+created and the key already exists in the database, an\n+:exc:`~django.db.IntegrityError` will be raised.\n+\n+Finally, a word on using ``get_or_create()`` in Django views. Please make sure\n+to use it only in ``POST`` requests unless you have a good reason not to.\n+``GET`` requests shouldn't have any effect on data. Instead, use ``POST``\n+whenever a request to a page has a side effect on your data. For more, see\n+:rfc:`Safe methods <7231#section-4.2.1>` in the HTTP spec.\n+\n+.. warning::\n+\n+  You can use ``get_or_create()`` through :class:`~django.db.models.ManyToManyField`\n+  attributes and reverse relations. In that case you will restrict the queries\n+  inside the context of that relation. That could lead you to some integrity\n+  problems if you don't use it consistently.\n+\n+  Being the following models::\n+\n+      class Chapter(models.Model):\n+          title = models.CharField(max_length=255, unique=True)\n+\n+      class Book(models.Model):\n+          title = models.CharField(max_length=256)\n+          chapters = models.ManyToManyField(Chapter)\n+\n+  You can use ``get_or_create()`` through Book's chapters field, but it only\n+  fetches inside the context of that book::\n+\n+      >>> book = Book.objects.create(title=\"Ulysses\")\n+      >>> book.chapters.get_or_create(title=\"Telemachus\")\n+      (<Chapter: Telemachus>, True)\n+      >>> book.chapters.get_or_create(title=\"Telemachus\")\n+      (<Chapter: Telemachus>, False)\n+      >>> Chapter.objects.create(title=\"Chapter 1\")\n+      <Chapter: Chapter 1>\n+      >>> book.chapters.get_or_create(title=\"Chapter 1\")\n+      # Raises IntegrityError\n+\n+  This is happening because it's trying to get or create \"Chapter 1\" through the\n+  book \"Ulysses\", but it can't do any of them: the relation can't fetch that\n+  chapter because it isn't related to that book, but it can't create it either\n+  because ``title`` field should be unique.\n+\n+``update_or_create()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: update_or_create(defaults=None, **kwargs)\n+\n+A convenience method for updating an object with the given ``kwargs``, creating\n+a new one if necessary. The ``defaults`` is a dictionary of (field, value)\n+pairs used to update the object. The values in ``defaults`` can be callables.\n+\n+Returns a tuple of ``(object, created)``, where ``object`` is the created or\n+updated object and ``created`` is a boolean specifying whether a new object was\n+created.\n+\n+The ``update_or_create`` method tries to fetch an object from database based on\n+the given ``kwargs``. If a match is found, it updates the fields passed in the\n+``defaults`` dictionary.\n+\n+This is meant as a shortcut to boilerplatish code. For example::\n+\n+    defaults = {'first_name': 'Bob'}\n+    try:\n+        obj = Person.objects.get(first_name='John', last_name='Lennon')\n+        for key, value in defaults.items():\n+            setattr(obj, key, value)\n+        obj.save()\n+    except Person.DoesNotExist:\n+        new_values = {'first_name': 'John', 'last_name': 'Lennon'}\n+        new_values.update(defaults)\n+        obj = Person(**new_values)\n+        obj.save()\n+\n+This pattern gets quite unwieldy as the number of fields in a model goes up.\n+The above example can be rewritten using ``update_or_create()`` like so::\n+\n+    obj, created = Person.objects.update_or_create(\n+        first_name='John', last_name='Lennon',\n+        defaults={'first_name': 'Bob'},\n+    )\n+\n+For detailed description how names passed in ``kwargs`` are resolved see\n+:meth:`get_or_create`.\n+\n+As described above in :meth:`get_or_create`, this method is prone to a\n+race-condition which can result in multiple rows being inserted simultaneously\n+if uniqueness is not enforced at the database level.\n+\n+Like :meth:`get_or_create` and :meth:`create`, if you're using manually\n+specified primary keys and an object needs to be created but the key already\n+exists in the database, an :exc:`~django.db.IntegrityError` is raised.\n+\n+``bulk_create()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: bulk_create(objs, batch_size=None, ignore_conflicts=False)\n+\n+This method inserts the provided list of objects into the database in an\n+efficient manner (generally only 1 query, no matter how many objects there\n+are)::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.bulk_create([\n+    ...     Entry(headline='This is a test'),\n+    ...     Entry(headline='This is only a test'),\n+    ... ])\n+\n+This has a number of caveats though:\n+\n+* The model's ``save()`` method will not be called, and the ``pre_save`` and\n+  ``post_save`` signals will not be sent.\n+* It does not work with child models in a multi-table inheritance scenario.\n+* If the model's primary key is an :class:`~django.db.models.AutoField` it\n+  does not retrieve and set the primary key attribute, as ``save()`` does,\n+  unless the database backend supports it (currently PostgreSQL).\n+* It does not work with many-to-many relationships.\n+* It casts ``objs`` to a list, which fully evaluates ``objs`` if it's a\n+  generator. The cast allows inspecting all objects so that any objects with a\n+  manually set primary key can be inserted first. If you want to insert objects\n+  in batches without evaluating the entire generator at once, you can use this\n+  technique as long as the objects don't have any manually set primary keys::\n+\n+    from itertools import islice\n+\n+    batch_size = 100\n+    objs = (Entry(headline='Test %s' % i) for i in range(1000))\n+    while True:\n+        batch = list(islice(objs, batch_size))\n+        if not batch:\n+            break\n+        Entry.objects.bulk_create(batch, batch_size)\n+\n+The ``batch_size`` parameter controls how many objects are created in a single\n+query. The default is to create all objects in one batch, except for SQLite\n+where the default is such that at most 999 variables per query are used.\n+\n+On databases that support it (all but Oracle), setting the ``ignore_conflicts``\n+parameter to ``True`` tells the database to ignore failure to insert any rows\n+that fail constraints such as duplicate unique values. Enabling this parameter\n+disables setting the primary key on each model instance (if the database\n+normally supports it).\n+\n+``bulk_update()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: bulk_update(objs, fields, batch_size=None)\n+\n+This method efficiently updates the given fields on the provided model\n+instances, generally with one query::\n+\n+    >>> objs = [\n+    ...    Entry.objects.create(headline='Entry 1'),\n+    ...    Entry.objects.create(headline='Entry 2'),\n+    ... ]\n+    >>> objs[0].headline = 'This is entry 1'\n+    >>> objs[1].headline = 'This is entry 2'\n+    >>> Entry.objects.bulk_update(objs, ['headline'])\n+\n+:meth:`.QuerySet.update` is used to save the changes, so this is more efficient\n+than iterating through the list of models and calling ``save()`` on each of\n+them, but it has a few caveats:\n+\n+* You cannot update the model's primary key.\n+* Each model's ``save()`` method isn't called, and the\n+  :attr:`~django.db.models.signals.pre_save` and\n+  :attr:`~django.db.models.signals.post_save` signals aren't sent.\n+* If updating a large number of columns in a large number of rows, the SQL\n+  generated can be very large. Avoid this by specifying a suitable\n+  ``batch_size``.\n+* Updating fields defined on multi-table inheritance ancestors will incur an\n+  extra query per ancestor.\n+* If ``objs`` contains duplicates, only the first one is updated.\n+\n+The ``batch_size`` parameter controls how many objects are saved in a single\n+query. The default is to update all objects in one batch, except for SQLite\n+and Oracle which have restrictions on the number of variables used in a query.\n+\n+``count()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: count()\n+\n+Returns an integer representing the number of objects in the database matching\n+the ``QuerySet``.\n+\n+Example::\n+\n+    # Returns the total number of entries in the database.\n+    Entry.objects.count()\n+\n+    # Returns the number of entries whose headline contains 'Lennon'\n+    Entry.objects.filter(headline__contains='Lennon').count()\n+\n+A ``count()`` call performs a ``SELECT COUNT(*)`` behind the scenes, so you\n+should always use ``count()`` rather than loading all of the record into Python\n+objects and calling ``len()`` on the result (unless you need to load the\n+objects into memory anyway, in which case ``len()`` will be faster).\n+\n+Note that if you want the number of items in a ``QuerySet`` and are also\n+retrieving model instances from it (for example, by iterating over it), it's\n+probably more efficient to use ``len(queryset)`` which won't cause an extra\n+database query like ``count()`` would.\n+\n+``in_bulk()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: in_bulk(id_list=None, field_name='pk')\n+\n+Takes a list of field values (``id_list``) and the ``field_name`` for those\n+values, and returns a dictionary mapping each value to an instance of the\n+object with the given field value. If ``id_list`` isn't provided, all objects\n+in the queryset are returned. ``field_name`` must be a unique field, and it\n+defaults to the primary key.\n+\n+Example::\n+\n+    >>> Blog.objects.in_bulk([1])\n+    {1: <Blog: Beatles Blog>}\n+    >>> Blog.objects.in_bulk([1, 2])\n+    {1: <Blog: Beatles Blog>, 2: <Blog: Cheddar Talk>}\n+    >>> Blog.objects.in_bulk([])\n+    {}\n+    >>> Blog.objects.in_bulk()\n+    {1: <Blog: Beatles Blog>, 2: <Blog: Cheddar Talk>, 3: <Blog: Django Weblog>}\n+    >>> Blog.objects.in_bulk(['beatles_blog'], field_name='slug')\n+    {'beatles_blog': <Blog: Beatles Blog>}\n+\n+If you pass ``in_bulk()`` an empty list, you'll get an empty dictionary.\n+\n+``iterator()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: iterator(chunk_size=2000)\n+\n+Evaluates the ``QuerySet`` (by performing the query) and returns an iterator\n+(see :pep:`234`) over the results. A ``QuerySet`` typically caches its results\n+internally so that repeated evaluations do not result in additional queries. In\n+contrast, ``iterator()`` will read results directly, without doing any caching\n+at the ``QuerySet`` level (internally, the default iterator calls ``iterator()``\n+and caches the return value). For a ``QuerySet`` which returns a large number of\n+objects that you only need to access once, this can result in better\n+performance and a significant reduction in memory.\n+\n+Note that using ``iterator()`` on a ``QuerySet`` which has already been\n+evaluated will force it to evaluate again, repeating the query.\n+\n+Also, use of ``iterator()`` causes previous ``prefetch_related()`` calls to be\n+ignored since these two optimizations do not make sense together.\n+\n+Depending on the database backend, query results will either be loaded all at\n+once or streamed from the database using server-side cursors.\n+\n+With server-side cursors\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+Oracle and :ref:`PostgreSQL <postgresql-server-side-cursors>` use server-side\n+cursors to stream results from the database without loading the entire result\n+set into memory.\n+\n+The Oracle database driver always uses server-side cursors.\n+\n+With server-side cursors, the ``chunk_size`` parameter specifies the number of\n+results to cache at the database driver level. Fetching bigger chunks\n+diminishes the number of round trips between the database driver and the\n+database, at the expense of memory.\n+\n+On PostgreSQL, server-side cursors will only be used when the\n+:setting:`DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS <DATABASE-DISABLE_SERVER_SIDE_CURSORS>`\n+setting is ``False``. Read :ref:`transaction-pooling-server-side-cursors` if\n+you're using a connection pooler configured in transaction pooling mode. When\n+server-side cursors are disabled, the behavior is the same as databases that\n+don't support server-side cursors.\n+\n+Without server-side cursors\n+^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n+\n+MySQL doesn't support streaming results, hence the Python database driver loads\n+the entire result set into memory. The result set is then transformed into\n+Python row objects by the database adapter using the ``fetchmany()`` method\n+defined in :pep:`249`.\n+\n+SQLite can fetch results in batches using ``fetchmany()``, but since SQLite\n+doesn't provide isolation between queries within a connection, be careful when\n+writing to the table being iterated over. See :ref:`sqlite-isolation` for\n+more information.\n+\n+The ``chunk_size`` parameter controls the size of batches Django retrieves from\n+the database driver. Larger batches decrease the overhead of communicating with\n+the database driver at the expense of a slight increase in memory consumption.\n+\n+The default value of ``chunk_size``, 2000, comes from `a calculation on the\n+psycopg mailing list <https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/4D2F2C71.8080805%40dndg.it>`_:\n+\n+    Assuming rows of 10-20 columns with a mix of textual and numeric data, 2000\n+    is going to fetch less than 100KB of data, which seems a good compromise\n+    between the number of rows transferred and the data discarded if the loop\n+    is exited early.\n+\n+``latest()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: latest(*fields)\n+\n+Returns the latest object in the table based on the given field(s).\n+\n+This example returns the latest ``Entry`` in the table, according to the\n+``pub_date`` field::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.latest('pub_date')\n+\n+You can also choose the latest based on several fields. For example, to select\n+the ``Entry`` with the earliest ``expire_date`` when two entries have the same\n+``pub_date``::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.latest('pub_date', '-expire_date')\n+\n+The negative sign in ``'-expire_date'`` means to sort ``expire_date`` in\n+*descending* order. Since ``latest()`` gets the last result, the ``Entry`` with\n+the earliest ``expire_date`` is selected.\n+\n+If your model's :ref:`Meta <meta-options>` specifies\n+:attr:`~django.db.models.Options.get_latest_by`, you can omit any arguments to\n+``earliest()`` or ``latest()``. The fields specified in\n+:attr:`~django.db.models.Options.get_latest_by` will be used by default.\n+\n+Like :meth:`get()`, ``earliest()`` and ``latest()`` raise\n+:exc:`~django.db.models.Model.DoesNotExist` if there is no object with the\n+given parameters.\n+\n+Note that ``earliest()`` and ``latest()`` exist purely for convenience and\n+readability.\n+\n+.. admonition:: ``earliest()`` and ``latest()`` may return instances with null dates.\n+\n+    Since ordering is delegated to the database, results on fields that allow\n+    null values may be ordered differently if you use different databases. For\n+    example, PostgreSQL and MySQL sort null values as if they are higher than\n+    non-null values, while SQLite does the opposite.\n+\n+    You may want to filter out null values::\n+\n+        Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__isnull=False).latest('pub_date')\n+\n+``earliest()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: earliest(*fields)\n+\n+Works otherwise like :meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.latest` except\n+the direction is changed.\n+\n+``first()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: first()\n+\n+Returns the first object matched by the queryset, or ``None`` if there\n+is no matching object. If the ``QuerySet`` has no ordering defined, then the\n+queryset is automatically ordered by the primary key. This can affect\n+aggregation results as described in :ref:`aggregation-ordering-interaction`.\n+\n+Example::\n+\n+    p = Article.objects.order_by('title', 'pub_date').first()\n+\n+Note that ``first()`` is a convenience method, the following code sample is\n+equivalent to the above example::\n+\n+    try:\n+        p = Article.objects.order_by('title', 'pub_date')[0]\n+    except IndexError:\n+        p = None\n+\n+``last()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: last()\n+\n+Works like  :meth:`first()`, but returns the last object in the queryset.\n+\n+``aggregate()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: aggregate(*args, **kwargs)\n+\n+Returns a dictionary of aggregate values (averages, sums, etc.) calculated over\n+the ``QuerySet``. Each argument to ``aggregate()`` specifies a value that will\n+be included in the dictionary that is returned.\n+\n+The aggregation functions that are provided by Django are described in\n+`Aggregation Functions`_ below. Since aggregates are also :doc:`query\n+expressions </ref/models/expressions>`, you may combine aggregates with other\n+aggregates or values to create complex aggregates.\n+\n+Aggregates specified using keyword arguments will use the keyword as the name\n+for the annotation. Anonymous arguments will have a name generated for them\n+based upon the name of the aggregate function and the model field that is being\n+aggregated. Complex aggregates cannot use anonymous arguments and must specify\n+a keyword argument as an alias.\n+\n+For example, when you are working with blog entries, you may want to know the\n+number of authors that have contributed blog entries::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import Count\n+    >>> q = Blog.objects.aggregate(Count('entry'))\n+    {'entry__count': 16}\n+\n+By using a keyword argument to specify the aggregate function, you can\n+control the name of the aggregation value that is returned::\n+\n+    >>> q = Blog.objects.aggregate(number_of_entries=Count('entry'))\n+    {'number_of_entries': 16}\n+\n+For an in-depth discussion of aggregation, see :doc:`the topic guide on\n+Aggregation </topics/db/aggregation>`.\n+\n+``exists()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: exists()\n+\n+Returns ``True`` if the :class:`.QuerySet` contains any results, and ``False``\n+if not. This tries to perform the query in the simplest and fastest way\n+possible, but it *does* execute nearly the same query as a normal\n+:class:`.QuerySet` query.\n+\n+:meth:`~.QuerySet.exists` is useful for searches relating to both\n+object membership in a :class:`.QuerySet` and to the existence of any objects in\n+a :class:`.QuerySet`, particularly in the context of a large :class:`.QuerySet`.\n+\n+The most efficient method of finding whether a model with a unique field\n+(e.g. ``primary_key``) is a member of a :class:`.QuerySet` is::\n+\n+    entry = Entry.objects.get(pk=123)\n+    if some_queryset.filter(pk=entry.pk).exists():\n+        print(\"Entry contained in queryset\")\n+\n+Which will be faster than the following which requires evaluating and iterating\n+through the entire queryset::\n+\n+    if entry in some_queryset:\n+       print(\"Entry contained in QuerySet\")\n+\n+And to find whether a queryset contains any items::\n+\n+    if some_queryset.exists():\n+        print(\"There is at least one object in some_queryset\")\n+\n+Which will be faster than::\n+\n+    if some_queryset:\n+        print(\"There is at least one object in some_queryset\")\n+\n+... but not by a large degree (hence needing a large queryset for efficiency\n+gains).\n+\n+Additionally, if a ``some_queryset`` has not yet been evaluated, but you know\n+that it will be at some point, then using ``some_queryset.exists()`` will do\n+more overall work (one query for the existence check plus an extra one to later\n+retrieve the results) than using ``bool(some_queryset)``, which retrieves the\n+results and then checks if any were returned.\n+\n+``update()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: update(**kwargs)\n+\n+Performs an SQL update query for the specified fields, and returns\n+the number of rows matched (which may not be equal to the number of rows\n+updated if some rows already have the new value).\n+\n+For example, to turn comments off for all blog entries published in 2010,\n+you could do this::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010).update(comments_on=False)\n+\n+(This assumes your ``Entry`` model has fields ``pub_date`` and ``comments_on``.)\n+\n+You can update multiple fields \u2014 there's no limit on how many. For example,\n+here we update the ``comments_on`` and ``headline`` fields::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010).update(comments_on=False, headline='This is old')\n+\n+The ``update()`` method is applied instantly, and the only restriction on the\n+:class:`.QuerySet` that is updated is that it can only update columns in the\n+model's main table, not on related models. You can't do this, for example::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.update(blog__name='foo') # Won't work!\n+\n+Filtering based on related fields is still possible, though::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(blog__id=1).update(comments_on=True)\n+\n+You cannot call ``update()`` on a :class:`.QuerySet` that has had a slice taken\n+or can otherwise no longer be filtered.\n+\n+The ``update()`` method returns the number of affected rows::\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(id=64).update(comments_on=True)\n+    1\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(slug='nonexistent-slug').update(comments_on=True)\n+    0\n+\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010).update(comments_on=False)\n+    132\n+\n+If you're just updating a record and don't need to do anything with the model\n+object, the most efficient approach is to call ``update()``, rather than\n+loading the model object into memory. For example, instead of doing this::\n+\n+    e = Entry.objects.get(id=10)\n+    e.comments_on = False\n+    e.save()\n+\n+...do this::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.filter(id=10).update(comments_on=False)\n+\n+Using ``update()`` also prevents a race condition wherein something might\n+change in your database in the short period of time between loading the object\n+and calling ``save()``.\n+\n+Finally, realize that ``update()`` does an update at the SQL level and, thus,\n+does not call any ``save()`` methods on your models, nor does it emit the\n+:attr:`~django.db.models.signals.pre_save` or\n+:attr:`~django.db.models.signals.post_save` signals (which are a consequence of\n+calling :meth:`Model.save() <django.db.models.Model.save>`). If you want to\n+update a bunch of records for a model that has a custom\n+:meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save()` method, loop over them and call\n+:meth:`~django.db.models.Model.save()`, like this::\n+\n+    for e in Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__year=2010):\n+        e.comments_on = False\n+        e.save()\n+\n+``delete()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: delete()\n+\n+Performs an SQL delete query on all rows in the :class:`.QuerySet` and\n+returns the number of objects deleted and a dictionary with the number of\n+deletions per object type.\n+\n+The ``delete()`` is applied instantly. You cannot call ``delete()`` on a\n+:class:`.QuerySet` that has had a slice taken or can otherwise no longer be\n+filtered.\n+\n+For example, to delete all the entries in a particular blog::\n+\n+    >>> b = Blog.objects.get(pk=1)\n+\n+    # Delete all the entries belonging to this Blog.\n+    >>> Entry.objects.filter(blog=b).delete()\n+    (4, {'weblog.Entry': 2, 'weblog.Entry_authors': 2})\n+\n+By default, Django's :class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey` emulates the SQL\n+constraint ``ON DELETE CASCADE`` \u2014 in other words, any objects with foreign\n+keys pointing at the objects to be deleted will be deleted along with them.\n+For example::\n+\n+    >>> blogs = Blog.objects.all()\n+\n+    # This will delete all Blogs and all of their Entry objects.\n+    >>> blogs.delete()\n+    (5, {'weblog.Blog': 1, 'weblog.Entry': 2, 'weblog.Entry_authors': 2})\n+\n+This cascade behavior is customizable via the\n+:attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete` argument to the\n+:class:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey`.\n+\n+The ``delete()`` method does a bulk delete and does not call any ``delete()``\n+methods on your models. It does, however, emit the\n+:data:`~django.db.models.signals.pre_delete` and\n+:data:`~django.db.models.signals.post_delete` signals for all deleted objects\n+(including cascaded deletions).\n+\n+Django needs to fetch objects into memory to send signals and handle cascades.\n+However, if there are no cascades and no signals, then Django may take a\n+fast-path and delete objects without fetching into memory. For large\n+deletes this can result in significantly reduced memory usage. The amount of\n+executed queries can be reduced, too.\n+\n+ForeignKeys which are set to :attr:`~django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete`\n+``DO_NOTHING`` do not prevent taking the fast-path in deletion.\n+\n+Note that the queries generated in object deletion is an implementation\n+detail subject to change.\n+\n+``as_manager()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. classmethod:: as_manager()\n+\n+Class method that returns an instance of :class:`~django.db.models.Manager`\n+with a copy of the ``QuerySet``\u2019s methods. See\n+:ref:`create-manager-with-queryset-methods` for more details.\n+\n+``explain()``\n+~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+.. method:: explain(format=None, **options)\n+\n+Returns a string of the ``QuerySet``\u2019s execution plan, which details how the\n+database would execute the query, including any indexes or joins that would be\n+used. Knowing these details may help you improve the performance of slow\n+queries.\n+\n+For example, when using PostgreSQL::\n+\n+    >>> print(Blog.objects.filter(title='My Blog').explain())\n+    Seq Scan on blog  (cost=0.00..35.50 rows=10 width=12)\n+      Filter: (title = 'My Blog'::bpchar)\n+\n+The output differs significantly between databases.\n+\n+``explain()`` is supported by all built-in database backends except Oracle\n+because an implementation there isn't straightforward.\n+\n+The ``format`` parameter changes the output format from the databases's default,\n+usually text-based. PostgreSQL supports ``'TEXT'``, ``'JSON'``, ``'YAML'``, and\n+``'XML'``. MySQL supports ``'TEXT'`` (also called ``'TRADITIONAL'``) and\n+``'JSON'``.\n+\n+Some databases accept flags that can return more information about the query.\n+Pass these flags as keyword arguments. For example, when using PostgreSQL::\n+\n+    >>> print(Blog.objects.filter(title='My Blog').explain(verbose=True))\n+    Seq Scan on public.blog  (cost=0.00..35.50 rows=10 width=12) (actual time=0.004..0.004 rows=10 loops=1)\n+      Output: id, title\n+      Filter: (blog.title = 'My Blog'::bpchar)\n+    Planning time: 0.064 ms\n+    Execution time: 0.058 ms\n+\n+On some databases, flags may cause the query to be executed which could have\n+adverse effects on your database. For example, PostgreSQL's ``ANALYZE`` flag\n+could result in changes to data if there are triggers or if a function is\n+called, even for a ``SELECT`` query.\n+\n+.. _field-lookups:\n+\n+``Field`` lookups\n+-----------------\n+\n+Field lookups are how you specify the meat of an SQL ``WHERE`` clause. They're\n+specified as keyword arguments to the ``QuerySet`` methods :meth:`filter()`,\n+:meth:`exclude()` and :meth:`get()`.\n+\n+For an introduction, see :ref:`models and database queries documentation\n+<field-lookups-intro>`.\n+\n+Django's built-in lookups are listed below. It is also possible to write\n+:doc:`custom lookups </howto/custom-lookups>` for model fields.\n+\n+As a convenience when no lookup type is provided (like in\n+``Entry.objects.get(id=14)``) the lookup type is assumed to be :lookup:`exact`.\n+\n+.. fieldlookup:: exact\n+\n+``exact``\n+~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Exact match. If the value provided for comparison is ``None``, it will be\n+interpreted as an SQL ``NULL`` (see :lookup:`isnull` for more details).\n+\n+Examples::\n+\n+    Entry.objects.get(id__exact=14)\n+    Entry.objects.get(id__exact=None)\n+\n+SQL equivalents:\n+\n+.. code-block:: sql\n+\n+    SELECT ... WHERE id = 14;\n+    SELECT ... WHERE id IS NULL;\n+\n+.. admonition:: MySQL comparisons\n+\n+    In MySQL, a database table's \"collation\" setting determines whether\n+    ``exact`` comparisons are case-sensitive. This is a database setting, *not*\n+    a Django setting. It's possible to configure your MySQL tables to use\n+    case-sensitive comparisons, but some trade-offs are involved. For more\n+    information about this, see the :ref:`collation section <mysql-collation>`\n+    in the :doc:`databases </ref/databases>` documentation.\n+\n+.. fieldlookup:: iexact\n+\n+``iexact``\n+~~~~~~~~~~\n+\n+Case-insensitive exact match.

WHERE id IN (1, 3, 4);\n+    SELECT ... WHERE headline IN ('a', 'b', 'c');\n+\n+You can also use a queryset to dynamically evaluate the list of values\n+instead of providing a list of literal values::\n+\n+    inner_qs = Blog.objects.filter(name__contains='Cheddar')\n+    entries = Entry.objects.filter(blog__in=inner_qs)\n+\n+This queryset will be evaluated as subselect statement:\n+\n+.. code-block:: sql\n+\n+    SELECT ... WHERE blog.id IN (SELECT id FROM ...

For example:\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import Prefetch\n+    >>> Question.objects.prefetch_related(Prefetch('choice_set')).get().choice_set.all()\n+    <QuerySet [<Choice: Not much>, <Choice: The sky>, <Choice: Just hacking again>]>\n+    # This will only execute two queries regardless of the number of Question\n+    # and Choice objects.\n+    >>> Question.objects.prefetch_related(Prefetch('choice_set')).all()\n+    <QuerySet [<Question: What's up?>]>\n+\n+The ``queryset`` argument supplies a base ``QuerySet`` for the given lookup.\n+This is useful to further filter down the prefetch operation, or to call\n+:meth:`~django.db.models.query.QuerySet.select_related()` from the prefetched\n+relation, hence reducing the number of queries even further:\n+\n+    >>> voted_choices = Choice.objects.filter(votes__gt=0)\n+    >>> voted_choices\n+    <QuerySet [<Choice: The sky>]>\n+    >>> prefetch = Prefetch('choice_set', queryset=voted_choices)\n+    >>> Question.objects.prefetch_related(prefetch).get().choice_set.all()\n+    <QuerySet [<Choice: The sky>]>\n+\n+The ``to_attr`` argument sets the result of the prefetch operation to a custom\n+attribute:\n+\n+    >>> prefetch = Prefetch('choice_set', queryset=voted_choices, to_attr='voted_choices')\n+    >>> Question.objects.prefetch_related(prefetch).get().voted_choices\n+    [<Choice: The sky>]\n+    >>> Question.objects.prefetch_related(prefetch).get().choice_set.all()\n+    <QuerySet [<Choice: Not much>, <Choice: The sky>, <Choice: Just hacking again>]>\n+\n+.. note::\n+\n+    When using ``to_attr`` the prefetched result is stored in a list. This can\n+    provide a significant speed improvement over traditional\n+    ``prefetch_related`` calls which store the cached result within a\n+    ``QuerySet`` instance.\n+\n+``prefetch_related_objects()``\n+------------------------------\n+\n+.. function:: prefetch_related_objects(model_instances, *related_lookups)\n+\n+Prefetches the given lookups on an iterable of model instances. This is useful\n+in code that receives a list of model instances as opposed to a ``QuerySet``;\n+for example, when fetching models from a cache or instantiating them manually.\n+\n+Pass an iterable of model instances (must all be of the same class) and the\n+lookups or :class:`Prefetch` objects you want to prefetch for. For example::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import prefetch_related_objects\n+    >>> restaurants = fetch_top_restaurants_from_cache()  # A list of Restaurants\n+    >>> prefetch_related_objects(restaurants, 'pizzas__toppings')\n+\n+``FilteredRelation()`` objects\n+------------------------------\n+\n+.. class:: FilteredRelation(relation_name, *, condition=Q())\n+\n+    .. attribute:: FilteredRelation.relation_name\n+\n+        The name of the field on which you'd like to filter the relation.\n+\n+    .. attribute:: FilteredRelation.condition\n+\n+        A :class:`~django.db.models.Q` object to control the filtering.\n+\n+``FilteredRelation`` is used with :meth:`~.QuerySet.annotate()` to create an\n+``ON`` clause when a ``JOIN`` is performed. It doesn't act on the default\n+relationship but on the annotation name (``pizzas_vegetarian`` in example\n+below).\n+\n+For example, to find restaurants that have vegetarian pizzas with\n+``'mozzarella'`` in the name::\n+\n+    >>> from django.db.models import FilteredRelation, Q\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.annotate(\n+    ...    pizzas_vegetarian=FilteredRelation(\n+    ...        'pizzas', condition=Q(pizzas__vegetarian=True),\n+    ...    ),\n+    ... ).filter(pizzas_vegetarian__name__icontains='mozzarella')\n+\n+If there are a large number of pizzas, this queryset performs better than::\n+\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.filter(\n+    ...     pizzas__vegetarian=True,\n+    ...     pizzas__name__icontains='mozzarella',\n+    ... )\n+\n+because the filtering in the ``WHERE`` clause of the first queryset will only\n+operate on vegetarian pizzas.\n+\n+``FilteredRelation`` doesn't support:\n+\n+* Conditions that span relational fields. For example::\n+\n+    >>> Restaurant.objects.annotate(\n+    ...    pizzas_with_toppings_startswith_n=FilteredRelation(\n+    ...        'pizzas__toppings',\n+    ...        condition=Q(pizzas__toppings__name__startswith='n'),\n+    ...    ),\n+    ... )\n+    Traceback (most recent call last):\n+    ...\n+    ValueError: FilteredRelation's condition doesn't support nested relations (got 'pizzas__toppings__name__startswith').\n+* :meth:`.QuerySet.only` and :meth:`~.QuerySet.prefetch_related`.\n+* A :class:`~django.contrib.contenttypes.fields.GenericForeignKey`\n+  inherited from a parent model.\ndiff --git a/docs/ref/models/querysets.txt b/docs/ref/models/querysets.txt\nindex 219245576a..0c64eb891e 100644\n--- a/docs/ref/models/querysets.txt\n+++ b/docs/ref/models/querysets.txt\n@@ -3275,6 +3275,9 @@ Example::\n \n     Entry.objects.filter(pub_date__isnull=True)\n \n+    Note that the `__isnull` lookup only accepts boolean values (True or False).\n+    Using non-boolean values will raise a ValueError.\n+\n SQL equivalent:\n \n .. code-block:: sql\ndiff --git a/tests/lookup/.backup.test_lookups.py b/tests/lookup/.backup.test_lookups.py\nnew file mode 100644\nindex 0000000000..294d00c6e1\n--- /dev/null\n+++ b/tests/lookup/.backup.test_lookups.py\n@@ -0,0 +1,32 @@\n+from datetime import datetime\n+\n+from django.db.models import Value\n+from django.db.models.fields import DateTimeField\n+from django.db.models.lookups import YearLookup\n+from django.test import SimpleTestCase\n+\n+\n+class YearLookupTests(SimpleTestCase):\n+    def test_get_bound_params(self):\n+        look_up = YearLookup(\n+            lhs=Value(datetime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0), output_field=DateTimeField()),\n+            rhs=Value(datetime(2010, 1, 1, 23, 59, 59), output_field=DateTimeField()),\n+        )\n+        msg = 'subclasses of YearLookup must provide a get_bound_params() method'\n+        with self.assertRaisesMessage(NotImplementedError, msg):\n+            look_up.get_bound_params(datetime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0), datetime(2010, 1, 1, 23, 59, 59))\n+\n+from django.db.models.lookups import IsNull\n+from django.db.models import F\n+\n+class IsNullLookupTests(SimpleTestCase):\n+    def test_isnull_lookup_with_non_boolean_value(self):\n+        look_up = IsNull(lhs=F('field'), rhs='not a boolean')\n+        with self.assertRaisesMessage(ValueError, \"The __isnull lookup requires a boolean value.\"):\n+            look_up.get_prep_lookup()\n+\n+    def test_isnull_lookup_with_boolean_value(self):\n+        look_up_true = IsNull(lhs=F('field'), rhs=True)\n+        look_up_false = IsNull(lhs=F('field'), rhs=False)\n+        self.assertTrue(look_up_true.get_prep_lookup())\n+        self.assertFalse(look_up_false.get_prep_lookup())\ndiff --git a/tests/lookup/test_lookups.py b/tests/lookup/test_lookups.py\nindex 9b2d90fdd9..ad7a96d675 100644\n--- a/tests/lookup/test_lookups.py\n+++ b/tests/lookup/test_lookups.py\n@@ -15,3 +15,17 @@ class YearLookupTests(SimpleTestCase):\n         msg = 'subclasses of YearLookup must provide a get_bound_params() method'\n         with self.assertRaisesMessage(NotImplementedError, msg):\n             look_up.get_bound_params(datetime(2010, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0), datetime(2010, 1, 1, 23, 59, 59))\n+\n+from django.db.models.lookups import IsNull\n+from django.db.models import F\n+\n+class IsNullLookupTests(SimpleTestCase):\n+    def test_isnull_lookup_with_non_boolean_value(self):\n+        with self.assertRaisesMessage(ValueError, \"The __isnull lookup requires a boolean value.\"):\n+            IsNull(lhs=F('field'), rhs='not a boolean')\n+\n+    def test_isnull_lookup_with_boolean_value(self):\n+        look_up_true = IsNull(lhs=F('field'), rhs=True)\n+        look_up_false = IsNull(lhs=F('field'), rhs=False)\n+        self.assertTrue(look_up_true.rhs)\n+        self.assertFalse(look_up_false.rhs)\n",
